Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Project Manager : All hooked up . { vocalsound } Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . Um { vocalsound } hopefully this meeting I 'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you 've been doing individually . The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . I do n't know if that meant that you could see it or not . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Did anyone ? Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : No . Project Manager : No . Oh well . Um I 'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there 's a shared project documents folder . Um and it should be in there . User Interface : Mm . Um um wi on on a what ? Oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay . Project Manager : Project documents , yeah . So I 'll put it in there . User Interface : Oh okay , yeah . Project Manager : Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it 's there ? User Interface : Yes , I think so . Project Manager : Yep . I 'll do that next time . Um { vocalsound } I 'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I 'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you 've been preparing during the time , so we 'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent User Interface : Yeah , the last minute , yeah , Project Manager : at the last minute , I 'm sorry about that , User Interface : yeah . Project Manager : but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group 's going to be and what the functions of the remote control { disfmarker } that 's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . And we 've got forty minutes to do that in . So I would say { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : You said uh targ target groups , Project Manager : yeah ? Industrial Designer : what does that mean ? Project Manager : As uh who it is that we 're going to be trying to sell this thing to , User Interface : { vocalsound } Um { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh okay , 'kay . Project Manager : yeah . Industrial Designer : So are { disfmarker } Project Manager : So we need to { disfmarker } yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . So with that I think it 's best if I hand over to you . Does anyone have a preference for going first ? Industrial Designer : Alright . { vocalsound } I can go first , Project Manager : You wan na go first ? Industrial Designer : yeah . User Interface : Okay . Hmm . Project Manager : Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : I assume we just pull it out ? User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Right . Um { vocalsound } so f from the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we { disfmarker } you do n't have to do it now but when { disfmarker } once you go back , User Interface : Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay . Industrial Designer : Right sure . Project Manager : just so that I do n't have to scribble everything down . Industrial Designer : Uh okay . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } So n uh with uh with regard to the { vocalsound } uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I 've identified um { vocalsound } a few basic uh components of the remote and uh { vocalsound } se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } So { vocalsound } { vocalsound } this is the method that uh I 'll mostly be following in my um { vocalsound } in my uh role . Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I 'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and { vocalsound } uh from the user interface person . Uh we 'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it 's a cyclical process . { vocalsound } Okay , so { vocalsound } these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um { vocalsound } so basically uh the { disfmarker } as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um { vocalsound } and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um { vocalsound } okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the { vocalsound } the use for television , { vocalsound } in order to keep things simple . Um { vocalsound } also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it { disfmarker } so { vocalsound } it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . { vocalsound } Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um { vocalsound } there 's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so { vocalsound } I 'll basic go over to the { disfmarker } Okay . { vocalsound } So { vocalsound } if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates { disfmarker } uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here . { vocalsound } So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um which then { disfmarker } so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated { vocalsound } to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver . Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay . { vocalsound } Um so { vocalsound } i in my personal preferences um { vocalsound } I 'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um { vocalsound } uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it 's compatible with mot most uh televisions . { vocalsound } That 's about it . { vocalsound } So anything that you would like to know or { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Thanks . Project Manager : Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } No , I do n't have any idea about what each component costs . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Br Industrial Designer : Um yeah . Project Manager : Okay . 'Cause that 's something to consider , I guess , if we 're if we 're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Certainly , yeah . So so tha yeah , { vocalsound } we definitely need to operate within our constraints , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : but um { vocalsound } unfortunately I I do not have any data , so uh I just identified the functional components for that . Project Manager : That 's fine . Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? User Interface : { vocalsound } I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay . Project Manager : Yeah , I think that will do . Okay , so do you want to { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes , shall shall we pull this up ? User Interface : okay , yeah . Project Manager : I think that has to come out of there . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm 'kay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Thanks . Project Manager : Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they 're gon na hit you the worst . { vocalsound } User Interface : Oh i { vocalsound } Okay , I hope { disfmarker } wait . Should it just { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I it 'll take some time . Project Manager : It ta takes a little { disfmarker } Oh , and have you { disfmarker } User Interface : There 's just nothing . Project Manager : you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , User Interface : Oh right , right , right , um { disfmarker } Project Manager : so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight . User Interface : Okay . Nothin Industrial Designer : Oh , there it is , yeah . User Interface : okay , something is coming up . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Now it 's coming , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } It 'll come up , it { disfmarker } um uh no signal . Project Manager : computer no signal . User Interface : No signal ? Why ? Project Manager : Maybe again ? Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah , it says something now , User Interface : Oh . My my computer went blank now . Industrial Designer : adjusting { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay , adjusting . User Interface : Adjusting . But { vocalsound } I do n't see anything Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : There we go , there we go . User Interface : I do n't see anything on my computer now . Industrial Designer : Oh , that 's strange . Project Manager : Oh , if you press if you press function and that again User Interface : This is the problem , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : there 's there 's usually three modes , one where it 's only here , one where it 's only there , and one where it 's both . Industrial Designer : Okay . User Interface : Um { gap } . Industrial Designer : And one more time . Project Manager : Okay , so one more time . User Interface : Uh now it 's { disfmarker } okay . No ? No . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Should { disfmarker } yeah just wait for a moment , adjusting . User Interface : Oh okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . User Interface : Okay , that 's fine , that 's good . Okay , let 's start from the beginning . So I 'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some { vocalsound } some first issues that came up . Um 'kay , so the method I was um adopting at this point , it 's not um for the for the whole um period of the um { vocalsound } all the project but it 's just at th at this very moment . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Um uh my method was um to look at um other { vocalsound } um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities . { vocalsound } And yeah , and then just to um { vocalsound } put the main function of the remote control in in words . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Um so the findings uh were { vocalsound } um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm { vocalsound } uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . And and also the volume is very important . Um { vocalsound } um { vocalsound } I als Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ? User Interface : okay . Industrial Designer : Uh switching on off channel , uh volume , { vocalsound } okay , that 's great . User Interface : 'Kay . Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm { vocalsound } functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they do n't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then { vocalsound } there are { disfmarker } surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . Um then { disfmarker } { vocalsound } yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then { vocalsound } the channel numbers and then um { vocalsound } the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then um other functionalities um { vocalsound } could be just { disfmarker } uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um { vocalsound } done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : So at the { disfmarker } for the time being that 's uh that 's all . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : If you have questions { disfmarker } Project Manager : If { disfmarker } I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for { disfmarker } that we really think it 's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . It 's w it 's just whether it 's worth arguing about . User Interface : Yeah , and also it 's it 's um { disfmarker } other question is uh because there are so many different { disfmarker } And there are so many different things that could possibly be included Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . Project Manager : Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay . Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . Um but um { vocalsound } so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or { disfmarker } I mean in { disfmarker } we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ? User Interface : Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use , Industrial Designer : Right . User Interface : I mean um what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user Industrial Designer : Yeah , and it 'll make the costs { disfmarker } yeah . User Interface : and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other mm proposals um . Industrial Designer : Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : and uh with um { disfmarker } because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . So yeah ? Cool . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Yep . Project Manager : Sure , we can discuss that maybe after the next one . Marketing : Cool . Do you wan na give me the little cable thing ? Project Manager : Do you want to { disfmarker } yeah . User Interface : Uh am I going in the right direction ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } No . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Wait . Project Manager : Oh , I 'm getting hungry . { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay , here it comes . Okay , here you are . Marketing : Cool . Ah , that 's why it wo n't meet . { vocalsound } Okay , cool . Project Manager : You set ? Marketing : Yep , cool . Okay , functional requirements . Project Manager : Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here . Marketing : Alright , yeah . Project Manager : Hello . Industrial Designer : { gap } try to press { disfmarker } Project Manager : Is it plugged in prop Industrial Designer : oh , okay , Marketing : It 's working . Project Manager : it 's working ? Industrial Designer : yep . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : Cool , okay . Project Manager : Excellent . Marketing : So what I have , wh where I 've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . Um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What 's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Um okay , so . What they found is that people do n't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . { vocalsound } Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Um current remote controls , they do n't match the user behaviour well , as you 'll see on the next slide . Um I dunno what zapping is , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : It 's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through . Marketing : Oh , right . But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what 's on . Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : so that 's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : they just make it look ugly . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Okay ? Cool . Um so this is my little graph thing . Project Manager : Ooh , that 's a bit difficult to see . Marketing : Mm k Project Manager : If you explain it to us it 'll be fine . Marketing : Okay , well , I can send it to all of you . What it is is um it 's cones , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : 'cause I thought they 'd be more exciting . Um but { disfmarker } Project Manager : I liked the , I liked the litt Marketing : ooh where 's it go ? Project Manager : ooh come back . Marketing : Back . Oh . Project Manager : No . Marketing : Oh yes , cool . Okay , I 'm gon na stop playing with the little pointy thing . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Um okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that 's used most is the channel selection . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : What you ca n't see is volume selection , it 's a little bit higher than all the others . Project Manager : Mm-hmm , that 's the next one along , yeah ? { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that 's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it 's not quite so essential , apparently , although I do n't understand how it could n't be , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } um and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they 're just not needed , and they 're not used . Okay . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that 's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . { vocalsound } Okay , cool . So um okay , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . Uh that they get lost , that the uh you know , they 're not intuitive and that they 're bad for repetitive strain injury . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : I think if you 're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know , watching T_V_ , then { vocalsound } that 's the least of your problems , Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } The remote control . { vocalsound } Marketing : but you know , { vocalsound } it 's up there . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Um that { disfmarker } yeah . Okay , so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yes . Okay , cool . Right , um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I did n't have time to white it out again . Project Manager : That 's alright . Marketing : Um okay , but that shows how people { disfmarker } whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite { disfmarker } are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they 're a bit more sceptical about it and they 're less willing to to try it . Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Um okay ? Cool . Um okay , so these are my personal preferences . { vocalsound } So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that 's , you know , a bit cool . Um you know , functional , so it 's useful , but minimalist . Um there 's a there 's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you 're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you 've got all this stuff , and you 're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gon na use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . Industrial Designer : Mm . Mm . Marketing : Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Um and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : not a mobile phone { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Some kind of a ring , Project Manager : Keys and things like that , Industrial Designer : some { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , that 's it , you know . Project Manager : yeah . Whistle and it { vocalsound } screams at you , yeah . Marketing : I know , it 's weird . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something { vocalsound } { disfmarker } a kind of sound that you do n't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : 'cause you do n't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : 'cause you you 'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : So okay ? Cool . That 's me . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Okay , that 's great , Project Manager : That 's you , excellent . User Interface : { vocalsound } Um that 's very good , Industrial Designer : thanks . Project Manager : Um . User Interface : very interesting . Project Manager : I 'm just gon na tick yes . So , we 've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um { vocalsound } uh Ka Kate Cat Cat 's uh presentation was um { vocalsound } uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people . Marketing : Cat 's . Ca { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : So if we need to have a target group um then uh { vocalsound } I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . Um . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Yeah , I mean that 's the thing is that it did n't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : but I 'm assuming , you know , yes . Industrial Designer : Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so if you want to put in something stylish , then uh th it 'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Yeah . Industrial Designer : yeah . Project Manager : Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket Industrial Designer : Right , and { disfmarker } Project Manager : and the { disfmarker } I do n't know how often they 're buying televisions . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Right . Mm . Marketing : Well , that 's when you go to uni , is n't it ? So , you know { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , but you do n't have much money , generally . User Interface : Yeah . Yeah , Project Manager : I would 've thought it 's it 's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they 've got their first job and they want their nice toys and { disfmarker } User Interface : you share a television or something that { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : But uh still , if if you can go back to that slide and uh , how popular was it ? Project Manager : O oh it 's on { disfmarker } Marketing : Oh , I 've unplugged it . Project Manager : sorry , we unplugged it . Industrial Designer : Oh , oh , okay . { vocalsound } Marketing : Do you want me to { disfmarker } Project Manager : Here , let me { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : That 's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Seventy six point three percent . Industrial Designer : so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them . User Interface : It was seventy something , yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : So even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ? Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Yeah , I kn I mean I know what you 're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they do n't have like { disfmarker } I mean , you know , if you 're at university , you 're paying your rent , Project Manager : Yeah , they 've got no commitments and Marketing : but you do n't have a mortgage , you do n't have a life insurance policy , Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : you do n't normally have a car , Project Manager : usually not a car and all of those things . Marketing : yeah , so . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : You 're still learning to drive actually , Project Manager : Kids . Yeah . Industrial Designer : So you 're more likely to b Marketing : so that just costs more than a car , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } but yeah . Um so I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think . Project Manager : Yeah , and if we 're if we 're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that 's not unaffordable , even for young people . Marketing : No , I mean that 's what , that 's like fifteen Pounds ? You know , I think { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah this this is not { vocalsound } unaffordable , Project Manager : { gap } User Interface : but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ { vocalsound } to use its full { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , I d I do n't know many people without a T_V_ . We did n't have a T_V_ last year , Project Manager : But do they { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : and everyone thought we were off our heads , you know . Project Manager : But the T_V_s are often kind of someone 's old T_V_ that 's blah blah User Interface : Common , the students { disfmarker } yeah , yeah . The s the stu Project Manager : and be a bit strange to have a fancy { vocalsound } rome remote . User Interface : yeah , and the remote control might not { disfmarker } yeah , Industrial Designer : Mm User Interface : it might not even function with the old T_V_ . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it 's quite popular , right ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , I d well we 've we 've got quite a d decent T_V_ . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : Yeah , Industrial Designer : So mm uh are are are { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : we 're still { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : You know , so I mean that and the disposable income and { disfmarker } I do n't think it 's something to ignore , you know . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : because actually I mean they 're all still re young people . Marketing : Is not a massive difference , you know . No , do totally . Project Manager : Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Um { vocalsound } Project Manager : Is that gon na have a { disfmarker } an implication for the technical specs ? Industrial Designer : I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I 'm not very sure about , because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? Uh and uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : You do have it in your mobile phone though , do n't you ? Because you have like { disfmarker } I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . But how frequently do we use it anyway User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : and um uh h ho how good is it , User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh { disfmarker } Marketing : I do n't know . Project Manager : Yeah . With um { disfmarker } but with a T_V_ remote it 's gon na be quite limited if we 're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , User Interface : An Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : S so { disfmarker } Project Manager : louder , Industrial Designer : Right . Okay . Project Manager : tha that should be relatively simple . Industrial Designer : O { vocalsound } Marketing : y you 'd maybe need a code word . Do you know what I mean ? Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : So like when you say change , except that 's { vocalsound } being said quite a lot on T_V_ , Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : so maybe like , you know , remote . I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_ ? Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Although I only watch Charmed , so really { vocalsound } I would n't know Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : but like so you 'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . Industrial Designer : Right . Yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , but maybe if you wan na look into that just to just to check . Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : Um , so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we 're going to get th anyone who 's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , User Interface : Yeah but uh um { disfmarker } Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . Project Manager : then they 'll they 'll still go for the same advertising . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : I do n't think there 's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls . User Interface : Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons Project Manager : Yeah , User Interface : and um , yeah it 's it 's kind of safer , so we we need both , Industrial Designer : Mm . W Project Manager : I think we need both . Industrial Designer : What uh { disfmarker } User Interface : so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it would n't really reduce the size of the remote . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : What wh uh { vocalsound } what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with { disfmarker } away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . Project Manager : Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , that would be another way to do it . Project Manager : So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great . Industrial Designer : some kind of { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because { disfmarker } I mean Sky advertise on every channel , do n't they , you know , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : so then it would be { disfmarker } you 'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Watch Sky and { vocalsound } yeah . Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : Yeah , yeah , Industrial Designer : Yeah , that 's { disfmarker } Marketing : and that would be really annoying . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . But that 's definitely a possibility . Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control is n't { vocalsound } as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . Marketing : Yeah . Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } So that you can yell at it , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . Project Manager : yeah . Marketing : It 's more like if you lost it and it 's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it { vocalsound } and it 'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Alright . User Interface : Yeah , but then the remote control I think { disfmarker } I mean { vocalsound } um the idea is kind of { disfmarker } it 's it 's not that it 's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you would n't you you would n't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . Marketing : Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you 're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control Project Manager : Mm . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : being cl I mean it 'll it 'll { disfmarker } mm . User Interface : No , but I I I was just defending the { vocalsound } the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . So uh { vocalsound } wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it 'll beep , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so we we can probably come to know where it is . Project Manager : That 's { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : but then if you 're buying the remote separately , User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : but y { vocalsound } you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , User Interface : Oh yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : Right , yeah , yeah , yeah . Project Manager : some { disfmarker } like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ . User Interface : Okay , yeah , mm-hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , 'cause it 's it 's quite important that you do n't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . Project Manager : The l Industrial Designer : Alright , yeah . Project Manager : Well that 's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises . Marketing : Yeah , definitely , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , I think we 're gon na have to wrap this up um . But if we go away with that that kind of general um { vocalsound } specification in mind that we 're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it 's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option User Interface : The major ones , yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it 's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . { vocalsound } User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you 'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we 've got a lunch break Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Um I 'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I 'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . Industrial Designer : So where exactly is this i Project Manager : It should be on your desktop , so on the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Ah , okay . Project Manager : yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : So I 'll put it { disfmarker } I 'll put them there as soon as I 've written them . User Interface : { vocalsound } Did you find it ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah in that one , User Interface : It 's just { disfmarker } yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : right yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , and email them round . Marketing : Oh , so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ? Project Manager : Yeah , that would be great . Marketing : Okay . User Interface : Oh so so we 'll just put them i there , Project Manager : Oh yeah , put them in there . Yeah , User Interface : we we { disfmarker } yeah , w we wo n't even { disfmarker } okay . Marketing : There you go . Project Manager : then you do n't have to email them . Marketing : But is everyone 's called functional requirements ? Industrial Designer : No . Project Manager : No , they 're all called something slightly different . Technical requirements and something something , yeah . Marketing : Okay , so that 's good . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : That 's me done . Project Manager : So , if you put them in there , we 'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . Marketing : Okay , cool . Project Manager : Um { vocalsound } as to where we 're going from here , you 're going to look at the components concept . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Yeah ? Whatever that means . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I guess I 'll find out . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : You 'll be looking { vocalsound } you 'll be looking at the user interface concept , User Interface : { vocalsound } Uh something conceptual , yeah . Project Manager : on something conceptual and you 're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition 'll fall off the map or something that { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : um we 'll keep keep our options op hmm ? Industrial Designer : Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh . Project Manager : Components , User Interface : Hmm . { vocalsound } Project Manager : yeah . User Interface : Sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or { vocalsound } shall we prepare our { disfmarker } Project Manager : No , we have we have { disfmarker } after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , User Interface : To prepare , okay , yeah , that 's good . Project Manager : so that 's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : Okay ? Right on time . User Interface : { vocalsound } Cool . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay , { vocalsound } so you can { disfmarker } I guess we 'll see you for lunch in a sec ? { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay , see you . 
Query : Summarize the presentations on working design , technical functions , functional requirements . Project Manager : All hooked up . { vocalsound } Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . Um { vocalsound } hopefully this meeting I 'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you 've been doing individually . The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . I do n't know if that meant that you could see it or not . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Did anyone ? Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : No . Project Manager : No . Oh well . Um I 'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there 's a shared project documents folder . Um and it should be in there . User Interface : Mm . Um um wi on on a what ? Oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay . Project Manager : Project documents , yeah . So I 'll put it in there . User Interface : Oh okay , yeah . Project Manager : Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it 's there ? User Interface : Yes , I think so . Project Manager : Yep . I 'll do that next time . Um { vocalsound } I 'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I 'll send them to you after the meeting . The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you 've been preparing during the time , so we 'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent User Interface : Yeah , the last minute , yeah , Project Manager : at the last minute , I 'm sorry about that , User Interface : yeah . Project Manager : but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group 's going to be and what the functions of the remote control { disfmarker } that 's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . And we 've got forty minutes to do that in . So I would say { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : You said uh targ target groups , Project Manager : yeah ? Industrial Designer : what does that mean ? Project Manager : As uh who it is that we 're going to be trying to sell this thing to , User Interface : { vocalsound } Um { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh okay , 'kay . Project Manager : yeah . Industrial Designer : So are { disfmarker } Project Manager : So we need to { disfmarker } yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . So with that I think it 's best if I hand over to you . Does anyone have a preference for going first ? Industrial Designer : Alright . { vocalsound } I can go first , Project Manager : You wan na go first ? Industrial Designer : yeah . User Interface : Okay . Hmm . Project Manager : Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : I assume we just pull it out ? User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Right . Um { vocalsound } so f from the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we { disfmarker } you do n't have to do it now but when { disfmarker } once you go back , User Interface : Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay . Industrial Designer : Right sure . Project Manager : just so that I do n't have to scribble everything down . Industrial Designer : Uh okay . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } So n uh with uh with regard to the { vocalsound } uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I 've identified um { vocalsound } a few basic uh components of the remote and uh { vocalsound } se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } So { vocalsound } { vocalsound } this is the method that uh I 'll mostly be following in my um { vocalsound } in my uh role . Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I 'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and { vocalsound } uh from the user interface person . Uh we 'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it 's a cyclical process . { vocalsound } Okay , so { vocalsound } these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um { vocalsound } so basically uh the { disfmarker } as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um { vocalsound } and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um { vocalsound } okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the { vocalsound } the use for television , { vocalsound } in order to keep things simple . Um { vocalsound } also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it { disfmarker } so { vocalsound } it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . { vocalsound } Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um { vocalsound } there 's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so { vocalsound } I 'll basic go over to the { disfmarker } Okay . { vocalsound } So { vocalsound } if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates { disfmarker } uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here . { vocalsound } So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um which then { disfmarker } so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated { vocalsound } to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver . Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay . { vocalsound } Um so { vocalsound } i in my personal preferences um { vocalsound } I 'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um { vocalsound } uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it 's compatible with mot most uh televisions . { vocalsound } That 's about it . { vocalsound } So anything that you would like to know or { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Thanks . Project Manager : Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } No , I do n't have any idea about what each component costs . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Br Industrial Designer : Um yeah . Project Manager : Okay . 'Cause that 's something to consider , I guess , if we 're if we 're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Certainly , yeah . So so tha yeah , { vocalsound } we definitely need to operate within our constraints , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : but um { vocalsound } unfortunately I I do not have any data , so uh I just identified the functional components for that . Project Manager : That 's fine . Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? User Interface : { vocalsound } I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay . Project Manager : Yeah , I think that will do . Okay , so do you want to { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes , shall shall we pull this up ? User Interface : okay , yeah . Project Manager : I think that has to come out of there . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm 'kay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Thanks . Project Manager : Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they 're gon na hit you the worst . { vocalsound } User Interface : Oh i { vocalsound } Okay , I hope { disfmarker } wait . Should it just { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I it 'll take some time . Project Manager : It ta takes a little { disfmarker } Oh , and have you { disfmarker } User Interface : There 's just nothing . Project Manager : you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , User Interface : Oh right , right , right , um { disfmarker } Project Manager : so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight . User Interface : Okay . Nothin Industrial Designer : Oh , there it is , yeah . User Interface : okay , something is coming up . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Now it 's coming , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } It 'll come up , it { disfmarker } um uh no signal . Project Manager : computer no signal . User Interface : No signal ? Why ? Project Manager : Maybe again ? Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah , it says something now , User Interface : Oh . My my computer went blank now . Industrial Designer : adjusting { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay , adjusting . User Interface : Adjusting . But { vocalsound } I do n't see anything Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : There we go , there we go . User Interface : I do n't see anything on my computer now . Industrial Designer : Oh , that 's strange . Project Manager : Oh , if you press if you press function and that again User Interface : This is the problem , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : there 's there 's usually three modes , one where it 's only here , one where it 's only there , and one where it 's both . Industrial Designer : Okay . User Interface : Um { gap } . Industrial Designer : And one more time . Project Manager : Okay , so one more time . User Interface : Uh now it 's { disfmarker } okay . No ? No . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Should { disfmarker } yeah just wait for a moment , adjusting . User Interface : Oh okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . User Interface : Okay , that 's fine , that 's good . Okay , let 's start from the beginning . So I 'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some { vocalsound } some first issues that came up . Um 'kay , so the method I was um adopting at this point , it 's not um for the for the whole um period of the um { vocalsound } all the project but it 's just at th at this very moment . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Um uh my method was um to look at um other { vocalsound } um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities . { vocalsound } And yeah , and then just to um { vocalsound } put the main function of the remote control in in words . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Um so the findings uh were { vocalsound } um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm { vocalsound } uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . And and also the volume is very important . Um { vocalsound } um { vocalsound } I als Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ? User Interface : okay . Industrial Designer : Uh switching on off channel , uh volume , { vocalsound } okay , that 's great . User Interface : 'Kay . Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm { vocalsound } functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they do n't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then { vocalsound } there are { disfmarker } surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . Um then { disfmarker } { vocalsound } yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then { vocalsound } the channel numbers and then um { vocalsound } the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then um other functionalities um { vocalsound } could be just { disfmarker } uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um { vocalsound } done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : So at the { disfmarker } for the time being that 's uh that 's all . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : If you have questions { disfmarker } Project Manager : If { disfmarker } I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for { disfmarker } that we really think it 's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . It 's w it 's just whether it 's worth arguing about . User Interface : Yeah , and also it 's it 's um { disfmarker } other question is uh because there are so many different { disfmarker } And there are so many different things that could possibly be included Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . Project Manager : Yeah . Mm-hmm . Okay . Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . Um but um { vocalsound } so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or { disfmarker } I mean in { disfmarker } we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ? User Interface : Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use , Industrial Designer : Right . User Interface : I mean um what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user Industrial Designer : Yeah , and it 'll make the costs { disfmarker } yeah . User Interface : and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other mm proposals um . Industrial Designer : Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : and uh with um { disfmarker } because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . So yeah ? Cool . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Yep . Project Manager : Sure , we can discuss that maybe after the next one . Marketing : Cool . Do you wan na give me the little cable thing ? Project Manager : Do you want to { disfmarker } yeah . User Interface : Uh am I going in the right direction ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } No . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Wait . Project Manager : Oh , I 'm getting hungry . { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay , here it comes . Okay , here you are . Marketing : Cool . Ah , that 's why it wo n't meet . { vocalsound } Okay , cool . Project Manager : You set ? Marketing : Yep , cool . Okay , functional requirements . Project Manager : Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here . Marketing : Alright , yeah . Project Manager : Hello . Industrial Designer : { gap } try to press { disfmarker } Project Manager : Is it plugged in prop Industrial Designer : oh , okay , Marketing : It 's working . Project Manager : it 's working ? Industrial Designer : yep . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : Cool , okay . Project Manager : Excellent . Marketing : So what I have , wh where I 've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . Um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What 's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Um okay , so . What they found is that people do n't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . { vocalsound } Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Um current remote controls , they do n't match the user behaviour well , as you 'll see on the next slide . Um I dunno what zapping is , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : It 's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through . Marketing : Oh , right . But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what 's on . Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : so that 's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : they just make it look ugly . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Okay ? Cool . Um so this is my little graph thing . Project Manager : Ooh , that 's a bit difficult to see . Marketing : Mm k Project Manager : If you explain it to us it 'll be fine . Marketing : Okay , well , I can send it to all of you . What it is is um it 's cones , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : 'cause I thought they 'd be more exciting . Um but { disfmarker } Project Manager : I liked the , I liked the litt Marketing : ooh where 's it go ? Project Manager : ooh come back . Marketing : Back . Oh . Project Manager : No . Marketing : Oh yes , cool . Okay , I 'm gon na stop playing with the little pointy thing . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Um okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that 's used most is the channel selection . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : What you ca n't see is volume selection , it 's a little bit higher than all the others . Project Manager : Mm-hmm , that 's the next one along , yeah ? { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that 's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it 's not quite so essential , apparently , although I do n't understand how it could n't be , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } um and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they 're just not needed , and they 're not used . Okay . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that 's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . { vocalsound } Okay , cool . So um okay , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . Uh that they get lost , that the uh you know , they 're not intuitive and that they 're bad for repetitive strain injury . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : I think if you 're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know , watching T_V_ , then { vocalsound } that 's the least of your problems , Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } The remote control . { vocalsound } Marketing : but you know , { vocalsound } it 's up there . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Um that { disfmarker } yeah . Okay , so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yes . Okay , cool . Right , um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I did n't have time to white it out again . Project Manager : That 's alright . Marketing : Um okay , but that shows how people { disfmarker } whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite { disfmarker } are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they 're a bit more sceptical about it and they 're less willing to to try it . Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Um okay ? Cool . Um okay , so these are my personal preferences . { vocalsound } So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that 's , you know , a bit cool . Um you know , functional , so it 's useful , but minimalist . Um there 's a there 's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you 're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you 've got all this stuff , and you 're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gon na use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . Industrial Designer : Mm . Mm . Marketing : Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Um and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : not a mobile phone { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Some kind of a ring , Project Manager : Keys and things like that , Industrial Designer : some { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , that 's it , you know . Project Manager : yeah . Whistle and it { vocalsound } screams at you , yeah . Marketing : I know , it 's weird . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something { vocalsound } { disfmarker } a kind of sound that you do n't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : 'cause you do n't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : 'cause you you 'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : So okay ? Cool . That 's me . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Okay , that 's great , Project Manager : That 's you , excellent . User Interface : { vocalsound } Um that 's very good , Industrial Designer : thanks . Project Manager : Um . User Interface : very interesting . Project Manager : I 'm just gon na tick yes . So , we 've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss 
Query : Why did Project Manager think of the advanced technology design when presenting the technical functions ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay . { vocalsound } Um so { vocalsound } i in my personal preferences um { vocalsound } I 'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um { vocalsound } uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it 's compatible with mot most uh televisions . { vocalsound } That 's about it . { vocalsound } So anything that you would like to know or { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Thanks . Project Manager : Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } No , I do n't have any idea about what each component costs . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Br Industrial Designer : Um yeah . Project Manager : Okay . 'Cause that 's something to consider , I guess , if we 're if we 're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Certainly , yeah . So so tha yeah , { vocalsound } we definitely need to operate within our constraints , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : but um { vocalsound } unfortunately I I do not have any data , so uh I just identified the functional components for that . Project Manager : That 's fine . Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? User Interface : { vocalsound } I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay . 
Query : Why did the group think of the locator when presenting the functional requirements ? Marketing : Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Um and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : not a mobile phone { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Some kind of a ring , Project Manager : Keys and things like that , Industrial Designer : some { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , that 's it , you know . Project Manager : yeah . Whistle and it { vocalsound } screams at you , yeah . Marketing : I know , it 's weird . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something { vocalsound } { disfmarker } a kind of sound that you do n't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : 'cause you do n't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : 'cause you you 'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : So okay ? Cool . That 's me . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Okay , that 's great , Project Manager : That 's you , excellent . User Interface : { vocalsound } Um that 's very good , Industrial Designer : thanks . Project Manager : Um . User Interface : very interesting . 
Query : Summarize the group discussion about general requirements . Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um { vocalsound } uh Ka Kate Cat Cat 's uh presentation was um { vocalsound } uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people . Marketing : Cat 's . Ca { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : So if we need to have a target group um then uh { vocalsound } I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . Um . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Yeah , I mean that 's the thing is that it did n't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : but I 'm assuming , you know , yes . Industrial Designer : Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so if you want to put in something stylish , then uh th it 'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Yeah . Industrial Designer : yeah . Project Manager : Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket Industrial Designer : Right , and { disfmarker } Project Manager : and the { disfmarker } I do n't know how often they 're buying televisions . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Right . Mm . Marketing : Well , that 's when you go to uni , is n't it ? So , you know { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , but you do n't have much money , generally . User Interface : Yeah . Yeah , Project Manager : I would 've thought it 's it 's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they 've got their first job and they want their nice toys and { disfmarker } User Interface : you share a television or something that { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : But uh still , if if you can go back to that slide and uh , how popular was it ? Project Manager : O oh it 's on { disfmarker } Marketing : Oh , I 've unplugged it . Project Manager : sorry , we unplugged it . Industrial Designer : Oh , oh , okay . { vocalsound } Marketing : Do you want me to { disfmarker } Project Manager : Here , let me { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : That 's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Seventy six point three percent . Industrial Designer : so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them . User Interface : It was seventy something , yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : So even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ? Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Yeah , I kn I mean I know what you 're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they do n't have like { disfmarker } I mean , you know , if you 're at university , you 're paying your rent , Project Manager : Yeah , they 've got no commitments and Marketing : but you do n't have a mortgage , you do n't have a life insurance policy , Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : you do n't normally have a car , Project Manager : usually not a car and all of those things . Marketing : yeah , so . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : You 're still learning to drive actually , Project Manager : Kids . Yeah . Industrial Designer : So you 're more likely to b Marketing : so that just costs more than a car , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } but yeah . Um so I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think . Project Manager : Yeah , and if we 're if we 're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that 's not unaffordable , even for young people . Marketing : No , I mean that 's what , that 's like fifteen Pounds ? You know , I think { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah this this is not { vocalsound } unaffordable , Project Manager : { gap } User Interface : but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ { vocalsound } to use its full { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , I d I do n't know many people without a T_V_ . We did n't have a T_V_ last year , Project Manager : But do they { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : and everyone thought we were off our heads , you know . Project Manager : But the T_V_s are often kind of someone 's old T_V_ that 's blah blah User Interface : Common , the students { disfmarker } yeah , yeah . The s the stu Project Manager : and be a bit strange to have a fancy { vocalsound } rome remote . User Interface : yeah , and the remote control might not { disfmarker } yeah , Industrial Designer : Mm User Interface : it might not even function with the old T_V_ . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it 's quite popular , right ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , I d well we 've we 've got quite a d decent T_V_ . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : Yeah , Industrial Designer : So mm uh are are are { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : we 're still { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : You know , so I mean that and the disposable income and { disfmarker } I do n't think it 's something to ignore , you know . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : because actually I mean they 're all still re young people . Marketing : Is not a massive difference , you know . No , do totally . Project Manager : Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Um { vocalsound } Project Manager : Is that gon na have a { disfmarker } an implication for the technical specs ? Industrial Designer : I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I 'm not very sure about , because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? Uh and uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : You do have it in your mobile phone though , do n't you ? Because you have like { disfmarker } I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . But how frequently do we use it anyway User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : and um uh h ho how good is it , User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh { disfmarker } Marketing : I do n't know . Project Manager : Yeah . With um { disfmarker } but with a T_V_ remote it 's gon na be quite limited if we 're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , User Interface : An Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : S so { disfmarker } Project Manager : louder , Industrial Designer : Right . Okay . Project Manager : tha that should be relatively simple . Industrial Designer : O { vocalsound } Marketing : y you 'd maybe need a code word . Do you know what I mean ? Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : So like when you say change , except that 's { vocalsound } being said quite a lot on T_V_ , Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : so maybe like , you know , remote . I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_ ? Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Although I only watch Charmed , so really { vocalsound } I would n't know Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : but like so you 'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . Industrial Designer : Right . Yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , but maybe if you wan na look into that just to just to check . Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : Um , so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we 're going to get th anyone who 's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , User Interface : Yeah but uh um { disfmarker } Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . Project Manager : then they 'll they 'll still go for the same advertising . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : I do n't think there 's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls . User Interface : Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons Project Manager : Yeah , User Interface : and um , yeah it 's it 's kind of safer , so we we need both , Industrial Designer : Mm . W Project Manager : I think we need both . Industrial Designer : What uh { disfmarker } User Interface : so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it would n't really reduce the size of the remote . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : What wh uh { vocalsound } what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with { disfmarker } away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . Project Manager : Uh-huh . Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , that would be another way to do it . Project Manager : So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great . Industrial Designer : some kind of { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because { disfmarker } I mean Sky advertise on every channel , do n't they , you know , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : so then it would be { disfmarker } you 'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Watch Sky and { vocalsound } yeah . Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : Yeah , yeah , Industrial Designer : Yeah , that 's { disfmarker } Marketing : and that would be really annoying . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . But that 's definitely a possibility . Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control is n't { vocalsound } as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . Marketing : Yeah . Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } So that you can yell at it , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . Project Manager : yeah . Marketing : It 's more like if you lost it and it 's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it { vocalsound } and it 'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Alright . User Interface : Yeah , but then the remote control I think { disfmarker } I mean { vocalsound } um the idea is kind of { disfmarker } it 's it 's not that it 's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you would n't you you would n't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . Marketing : Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you 're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control Project Manager : Mm . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : being cl I mean it 'll it 'll { disfmarker } mm . User Interface : No , but I I I was just defending the { vocalsound } the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . So uh { vocalsound } wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it 'll beep , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so we we can probably come to know where it is . Project Manager : That 's { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : but then if you 're buying the remote separately , User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : but y { vocalsound } you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , User Interface : Oh yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : Right , yeah , yeah , yeah . Project Manager : some { disfmarker } like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ . User Interface : Okay , yeah , mm-hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , 'cause it 's it 's quite important that you do n't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . Project Manager : The l Industrial Designer : Alright , yeah . Project Manager : Well that 's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises . Marketing : Yeah , definitely , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Okay , I think we 're gon na have to wrap this up um . But if we go away with that that kind of general um { vocalsound } specification in mind that we 're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it 's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option User Interface : The major ones , yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it 's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . { vocalsound } User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you 'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we 've got a lunch break Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Um I 'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I 'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . Industrial Designer : So where exactly is this i Project Manager : It should be on your desktop , so on the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Ah , okay . Project Manager : yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : So I 'll put it { disfmarker } I 'll put them there as soon as I 've written them . User Interface : { vocalsound } Did you find it ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah in that one , User Interface : It 's just { disfmarker } yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : right yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , and email them round . Marketing : Oh , so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ? Project Manager : Yeah , that would be great . Marketing : Okay . User Interface : Oh so so we 'll just put them i there , Project Manager : Oh yeah , put them in there . Yeah , User Interface : we we { disfmarker } yeah , w we wo n't even { disfmarker } okay . Marketing : There you go . Project Manager : then you do n't have to email them . Marketing : But is everyone 's called functional requirements ? Industrial Designer : No . Project Manager : No , they 're all called something slightly different . Technical requirements and something something , yeah . Marketing : Okay , so that 's good . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : That 's me done . Project Manager : So , if you put them in there , we 'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . Marketing : Okay , cool . Project Manager : Um { vocalsound } as to where we 're going from here , you 're going to look at the components concept . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Yeah ? Whatever that means . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I guess I 'll find out . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : You 'll be looking { vocalsound } you 'll be looking at the user interface concept , User Interface : { vocalsound } Uh something conceptual , yeah . Project Manager : on something conceptual and you 're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition 'll fall off the map or something that { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : um we 'll keep keep our options op hmm ? Industrial Designer : Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh . Project Manager : Components , User Interface : Hmm . { vocalsound } Project Manager : yeah . User Interface : Sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or { vocalsound } shall we prepare our { disfmarker } Project Manager : No , we have we have { disfmarker } after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , User Interface : To prepare , okay , yeah , that 's good . Project Manager : so that 's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : Okay ? Right on time . User Interface : { vocalsound } Cool . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay , { vocalsound } so you can { disfmarker } I guess we 'll see you for lunch in a sec ? { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay , see you . 
Query : What did the group think of disposable income when discussing general requirements ? Industrial Designer : That 's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Seventy six point three percent . Industrial Designer : so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them . User Interface : It was seventy something , yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : So even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ? Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm .

Query : Why did Project Manager think that they should try to incorporate voice recognition when discussing general requirements ? Project Manager : but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Um { vocalsound } Project Manager : Is that gon na have a { disfmarker } an implication for the technical specs ? Industrial Designer : I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I 'm not very sure about , because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? Uh and uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : You do have it in your mobile phone though , do n't you ? Because you have like { disfmarker } I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . But how frequently do we use it anyway User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : and um uh h ho how good is it , User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh { disfmarker } Marketing : I do n't know . Project Manager : Yeah . With um { disfmarker } but with a T_V_ remote it 's gon na be quite limited if we 're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , User Interface : An Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : S so { disfmarker } Project Manager : louder , Industrial Designer : Right . Okay . Project Manager : tha that should be relatively simple . Industrial Designer : O { vocalsound } Marketing : y you 'd maybe need a code word . Do you know what I mean ? Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : So like when you say change , except that 's { vocalsound } being said quite a lot on T_V_ , Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : so maybe like , you know , remote . I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_ ? Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Although I only watch Charmed , so really { vocalsound } I would n't know Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : but like so you 'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . Industrial Designer : Right . Yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , but maybe if you wan na look into that just to just to check . Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : Um , so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we 're going to get th anyone who 's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , User Interface : Yeah but uh um { disfmarker } Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . Project Manager : then they 'll they 'll still go for the same advertising . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : I do n't think there 's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls . User Interface : Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons Project Manager : Yeah , User Interface : and um , yeah it 's it 's kind of safer , so we we need both , Industrial Designer : Mm . W Project Manager : I think we need both . Industrial Designer : What uh { disfmarker } User Interface : so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it would n't really reduce the size of the remote . Project Manager : Yeah . 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . The Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)) : I call the meeting to order . Welcome to the seventh meeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic . Please note that today 's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House . We will proceed to ministerial announcements . I understand that there are no ministerial announcements . That 's confirmed . We will now proceed to presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15minutes . I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions . Once the petition is presented , the member is asked to bring it here to the Table . Mr.Manly is the first one to be allowed to present a petition . Mr. Paul Manly (NanaimoLadysmith, GP) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . I rise today to present a petition that has many signatures from constituents in NanaimoLadysmith . They 're calling for a ban on cosmetic testing using animals . They want us to follow the European Union model , under which the use of animals in cosmetic testing has been banned . Moving forward , they 're calling for a ban on the sale and manufacture of animal-tested cosmetics and their ingredients in Canada . The Chair : Mr. Poilievre is next . Hon. Pierre Poilievre (Carleton, CPC) : Thank you very much , Mr . Chair . I rise today to table e-petition 2466 , initiated by a constituent of mine in Stittsville , a beautiful west Ottawa community . The petition has collected 827 signatures from every province and territory . It was collected by Cara , a mother from my riding who suffered an unthinkable tragedy . Her 11-year-old son Joshua drowned in a boating accident on the St. Lawrence River at Rockport , Ontario . Joshua was not wearing a life jacket . Worse , Cara 's family had to wait 48 days to recover Joshua 's body . Cara is now working tirelessly to amend the small vessel regulations to make it mandatory for children under the age of 14 to wear a life jacket or PFD while they are passengers in or drivers of small vessels covered under parts 2 , 3 , and 4 of the regulations . I support Cara 's efforts , and I 'm honoured to table this petition on her behalf . The Chair : Seeing no further petitions to be presented , we 'll continue , and we will now proceed to the questioning of ministers . Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely . Go ahead , Mr. Scheer . Hon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition) : It was revealed yesterday that this government 's policy was to ignore fraud . The Prime Minister 's reaction was to act as if everything was normal . In fact , we 've learned that over 200,000cases of suspected fraud have been identified in the benefit applications . The Prime Minister is failing our future generations . Our children and grandchildren are going to pay back billions of dollars that he 's borrowing to pay tax cheats . Will the Prime Minister protect taxpayers and immediately begin a review of these 200,000cases of suspected fraud ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister) : Our priority was to get money out quickly to all Canadians who needed it , and that 's exactly what we 've done . Millions of Canadians have received the money they so desperately needed . Having said that , I want to make it very clear , Mr.Chair : Fraud is unacceptable . We have measures in place to detect fraud . All fraudsters will be required to pay back the money they fraudulently received from the government . We 're going to make sure that this is done in the coming months . Hon. Andrew Scheer : Mr . Chair , Conservatives agree that those who need help should get it , and no one is arguing that they should n't , but reports indicate that the Liberals have ordered public servants to turn a blind eye to 200,000 cases of suspected fraud . It 's a simple question : Yes or no , did the government instruct any government department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , the priority in this situation was getting money out to the millions of Canadians who needed it as quickly as possible , but of course fraud is unacceptable . That 's why we have put safeguards in place to ensure that anyone who received that money fraudulently will have to repay it . Hon. Andrew Scheer : It 's a yes-or-no question , Mr . Chair . Did the government give any kind of instruction to public servants in any department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases , yes or no ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : The instruction to government officials was to get money out to those who needed it as quickly as possible . We have put measures in place to detect fraud . People who got this money fraudulently will have to repay . Hon. Andrew Scheer : Mr . Chair , it is clear that he ca n't answer a yes-or-no question , so we can all assume what the answer must be . In other situations , the government is saying no to people . It 's letting so many Canadians down . Small business owners who do n't happen to have a CRA payroll number or a business account are ineligible for the government supports . Individuals , owner-operators , and those who are earning $ 1 more than $ 1,000 are being told that they do n't qualify for the emergency response benefits . Meanwhile , fraudsters are getting them . Does the Prime Minister think it 's fair to tell people who are following all the rules no , while telling government officials to allow fraudulent cases to be processed ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , Canadians well know that this is an unprecedented situation , one in which we had to get help to as many Canadians as possible as quickly as possible . That is exactly what we did . We continue to work very hard to fill gaps for people who should get money but have n't been able to , and , as I said , we have strong measures to counter fraud . Anyone who got this money fraudulently will have to repay it . Hon. Andrew Scheer : Mr . Chair , when these programs were first designed , the Prime Minister said that he acknowledged that there were problems and that they would be fixed later . Well , here we are in May , and hundreds of thousands of Canadians are being told no for purely technical and bureaucratic reasons . Will the Prime Minister make the simple changes to allow business owners who do n't happen to have a business bank account , who do n't happen to have a CRA payroll number and individuals who are ineligible for the emergency response benefit because they 've been paid by family members through dividends to qualify , or is he going to continue to let hundreds of thousands of Canadians down during this pandemic ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , from the beginning of this pandemic , we moved extremely rapidly to get help and support to millions of Canadians . That was the priority , and that 's what we 've been doing for the past two months . As we 've said , we will continue to tweak and improve the programs to make sure that more people who need help will get it . We are working the best we can , as fast as we can , to help those millions of Canadians who need support . The Chair : You have time for about a 15-second question , Mr. Scheer . Hon. Andrew Scheer : Mr . Chair , the Prime Minister indicated that he would support Taiwan 's inclusion in the WHO only as a non-state observer . Of course , that designation does not exist . Participants of the WHO are either states or NGOs . Will the Prime Minister support Taiwan 's participation as a state observer ? The Chair : The Right Honourable Prime Minister has 15 seconds or less , please . Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , we will continue with our one China policy , but we have always advocated Taiwan 's meaningful inclusion in international bodies where it makes sense to do so , and that includes at the WHO . The Chair : Mr.Blanchet now has the floor . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet (BeloeilChambly, BQ) : Thank you very much , Mr.Chair . On Friday , students in Quebec and Canada will be able to apply for the Canada emergency student benefit , which is a good thing . This program was necessary , particularly because the number of students who wo n't be able to get back their jobs from last year is much higher than the number of jobs that might be available to these young people . There are also issues of duration . We do n't know how long these jobs will remain unavailable . People talked about a risk to being in the labour market and meeting the needs of the labour market . On April29 , the Deputy Prime Minister made a formal commitment to ensure that these programs are accompanied by work incentives for youth and all CESB recipients . So that everyone knows what they 're getting into , I 'd like to know whether the employment incentives that will accompany the Canada emergency response benefit will be known by Friday . Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : I thank the hon . member for understanding the importance of supporting students who , for the most part , wo n't be able to get the summer jobs they were counting on . Young people do n't just want to earn money ; they also want to gain work experience . That 's why we 're setting up programs , including Canada summer jobs , but also another program with 76,000new jobs for young people in important sectors , so that young people can also get jobs . We will continue to work with youth and employers to ensure that gaps in the labour market are addressed , while ensuring that youth are well-supported . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : That 's very interesting , but it does n't answer my question at all . People in the fishing , tourism and agricultural sectors , as well as municipalities and , from the very beginning , of course , the Government of Quebec , more generally , have expressed fears that job gains will cause people to lose their benefits and discourage them from going to work . The only way to avoid that is to ensure that people keep more money as they work more . That is the principle . In fact , we propose that over the $ 1,000no-penalty limit , half of the earnings be exempt from penalty . Is this something that could be considered ? Since it 's been two weeks since the commitment was made and it 's urgent , can we act now ? The emergency should n't last eight months . Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , young people need money , but they also need work experience . This is an unprecedented situation , which is why we 're working with seasonal industries and the different regions to make sure they have a sufficient workforce in their situation . Students can be part of it , but at the same time we must provide the necessary support for those who ca n't find a job . That 's why we continue to work with the industries involved to ensure that they have a sufficient workforce while we support students . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Unfortunately , the spirit of it does n't seem to have been understood . I doubt that , even in the best-case scenario , the government will be able to get all the jobs needed in a timely manner for all these young people to decide to go ahead . So , first of all , there will be a shortage of jobs . Second , people are n't crazy . If they earn less by working than they earn by not working , all the good faith in the world wo n't solve the problem . Can we make sure that people keep more money in their pockets as they work more ? I think we can have a clear answer , given the timeframe . People are going to start registering for the program on Friday . The principles are good , but a clear answer would be good too . Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Beginning Friday , students will be able to apply for the Canada emergency student benefit . When they apply , they 'll all be directed to a job bank that we 've set up to make sure they know what jobs are available to get not only the money they need , but also the experience they need for their future , while helping our society in this crisis . I know we 're going to be able to count on young people . The Chair : We 'll now go to Mr. Singh . Mr. Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, NDP) : Thank you very much , Mr . Chair . Mr . Chair , one of the most devastating outcomes of this COVID-19 crisis has been the impact on seniors . Eighty per cent or more of the deaths during COVID-19 have been seniors living in long-term care homes . The military had to be called in . Out of 14 countries , Canada has been deemed the worst in its care of seniors . Despite all this , the Prime Minister has said recently that he does n't feel it 's the federal government 's responsibility to find a solution . How can he say to families reeling with loss that it 's not the federal government 's responsibility to play a role in solving this problem ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , perhaps the fact that the NDP no longer has many seats in Quebec has caused it to forget the importance of respecting the Constitution and the areas of jurisdiction of provincial versus federal governments . We will be there to work with the provinces as they deal with challenges in their long-term care facilities . We are there as a partner , but we , on this side of the House , will always respect the jurisdiction of the provinces and be there to support them in fulfilling those responsibilities . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : Everyone across Canada has just heard this Prime Minister double down on the idea that he does n't feel it 's his responsibility , despite the fact that the Canadian military had to go into long-term care homes . There is a role that the federal government can play . Both Liberal and Conservative federal governments have been consistently , for decades , cutting transfers to health care . They can increase those transfers to ensure long-term care is adequately funded . We could also ensure that there 's a national care guarantee , working with provinces to ensure that we are meeting the best standards . We could increase workers ' pay . We could ensure that there 's no more profiting off the backs of seniors when it comes to long-term care . Will the Prime Minister commit to some of these care guarantees ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : It will come as exactly no surprise to the vast majority of Canadians that the Liberal Party will always stand up for the Constitution of Canada . We respect the Constitution . We respect areas of provincial jurisdiction . As I have said from the very beginning of this crisis , we will be there to help the provinces as they manage the challenges they 're facing . The federal government does have a role to play , and it is a role to support the provinces in doing the things they need to do during this unprecedented time . We will continue to be there . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : I am glad to hear the Prime Minister is no longer trying to hide behind jurisdiction . We know that in long-term care homes , the for-profit long-term care homes have been the site of the worst conditions , where the greatest number of seniors have died . Will the Prime Minister join us in committing to remove profit from the long-term care system ? Vulnerable seniors should not be subject to the profits of a company willing to cut services , staffing and quality of care instead of ensuring that seniors get the best care possible . Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : I think it has become clear for all Canadians that we need to improve the care offered to our seniors right across the country . We can not look at these numbers we are seeing and these tragedies hitting so many families and not want to see us as a country do better . That is why we of course recognize that we will work with other orders of government , particularly the provinces in whose jurisdiction this area rests primarily , to support answering these questions for the long term on how we improve the way Canada supports our elders . This is something really important that we will be there for . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : At the CHSLD Herron in Dorval , 31seniors died in one month . The residents were left without food , dehydrated and without care , and those with COVID-19 symptoms were not isolated from the others . Families pay between $ 3,000 and $ 10,000 a month for their loved ones to be at the centre . How can the Prime Minister think that he does n't have a role to play in finding a solution to this devastating problem ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , all Quebeckers and even all Canadians were stunned to learn of the tragedy at the Dorval CHSLD . We were very happy , as citizens , when the Government of Quebec reacted firmly and asked many questions in connection with this situation . We will support the Government of Quebec in its efforts to find answers and , most importantly , to ensure that , in the long term , the country will better support seniors in all regions . The Chair : We 'll continue with Mr.Poilievre . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : Mr . Chair , how many emergency response benefit cheques have been sent to people whose applications have been flagged as fraudulent ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos (President of the Treasury Board) : Thank you , Mr.Chair . I 'd like to start by quickly saying that a total of 7.7million Canadians have received the Canada emergency response benefit , which is absolutely essential for Hon. Pierre Poilievre : How many emergency response benefits have been sent out to people whose applications have been flagged as fraudulent ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : Mr.Chair , I see that the pace will allow me to give a little bit of information for each question . As we said at the outset , there will be mechanisms The Chair : Mr.Poilievre has the floor . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : How many ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : We 're working very hard . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : How many ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : We 're working very hard to ensure the integrity of the mechanism while at the same time taking important steps to help Canadians . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : How many emergency response benefit cheques have been sent to people whose applications have been flagged as fraudulent ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : A total of 7.7million Canadians have received the Canada emergency response benefit , and the agency is ensuring the integrity of the system . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : He 's now claiming that it 's all 7.7 million ? That 's crazy . The department is reported to have given out 200,000 . Is 200,000 the correct number of cheques that have been sent out to people whose applications have been red-flagged as fraudulent , yes or no ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : Mr.Chair , I 'm pleased to use the opportunity given to me by the hon . member to make the following clarifications . I thank him for it . First , approximately 7.7million Canadians have received at least one payment . Second , almost 11million payments have been made . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : How many prisoners have received a Canada emergency response benefit cheque ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : This allows me to go even further and thank the hon . member again . Some 7.7million Canadians have received emergency assistance in an emergency situation The Chair : Mr.Poilievre has the floor . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : So now he 's claiming that 7 million Canadians are in jail ? The question was this : How many prisoners have received a benefit cheque ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : Mr.Chair , jokes can be made about the plight of Canadians who are suffering tremendously in this crisis , but I 'm not here to make The Chair : Mr.Poilievre has the floor . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : Even the CBC is saying that prisoners are receiving the cheque . They ca n't have lost their jobs . They were already in prison . It 's a simple question : How many prisoners have received the cheques ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : I 'd like to remind hon . members that we 're talking about an extremely serious situation , a situation that has called into question people 's ability to make ends meet , a situation that required emergency measures . We 're going to continue to do the job that Canadians expect . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : The question was , how many prisoners have received the cheques ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : I 've already explained to the hon . memberand I 'm pleased to remind himthat this benefit is an emergency measure . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : The Auditor General says that he 's dropping half of his audits because the government refuses to provide him with funding . If the government has enough money to send 200,000 fraudulent applicants emergency cheques , why wo n't the government give the Auditor General the funding he requested ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : I thank the hon . member . It gives me the opportunity , in this emergency situation , to talk about the role of institutions , including that of the Auditor General , which we will continue to support because it helps us do things right . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : Then what does the Auditor General have to do to get the money to do his audits ? Does he have to file a bunch of fraudulent applications for an emergency response benefit ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : Mr.Chair , because I know the hon . member well enough , I 'm sure that he is n't givingand does n't want to givethe impression that the Auditor General wants to commit fraud to do his job properly . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : I agree , and that 's why he should get the money he needs to do his job . He did twice as many audits under the previous government as he is doing now , but he does n't have the money to do the audits he needs to do to keep an eye on this government 's extraordinary spending . Yes or no , will the government give the Auditor General the funding he has requested so he can get back to doing the same number of audits he did under the much more robust funding of the previous Harper government ? The Chair : The hon . Prime Minister . Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , the previous government cut funding to the Auditor General and caused the office to lay off dozens of employees . We increased the funding for the Auditor General . We recognize the important work the Auditor General needs to do , and that 's why we increased the funding for the Auditor General . The party of the member opposite cut this funding . The Chair : I appreciate the help from some of the members in keeping time . I do have my own chronograph here , so I 'll take care of it from this end , but I appreciate the help . Thank you . I now give the floor to Mr.Deltell . Mr. Grard Deltell (Louis-Saint-Laurent, CPC) : Mr.Chair , I fully agree with the Treasury Board President that we are n't here to make jokes , but to set the record straight for Canadians . Yesterday , the National Post reported on the front page that 200,000people had fraudulently used emergency assistance . Is that statement accurate , yes or no ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : Mr.Chair , I thank the hon . member from my region . A few minutes ago , I was reminding people in my region that , in the greater Quebec City area , about 200,000people had received this emergency benefit and that it was not for fraudulent reasons , but because they really needed it . Mr. Grard Deltell : The question is about fraudsters , and I know that there are n't many of them in Quebec City . That said , my question is very simple . I want to know whether or not 200,000people fraudulently used emergency assistance . Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : I know my colleague already knows this , but we announced at the outset that strong and rigorous mechanisms would be put in place quickly to ensure that this delivery would respect the importance of integrity in government . Mr. Grard Deltell : The integrity of the government must be upheld , and this must be done by telling the truth . Yesterday , the National Post reported on the front page about 200,000fraudsters . Is that correct , yes or no ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : To set the record straight , the Minister of National Revenue , Ms.Lebouthillier , made it very clear that there was no tolerance for fraud in this system , that all mechanisms would be put in place to ensure that integrity would be respected . Mr. Grard Deltell : The Treasury Board President is one of the few Canadians to find that Ms.Lebouthillier was very clear yesterday . With respect to the Minister of National Revenue , I would point out that the member for RichmondArthabaska asked her a very clear question yesterday , which she was unable to answer . What does a person who has received the full CERB , $ 2,000 , and returns to work this week have to do ? Do they have to pay back the amount they are n't entitled to ? Do they keep the $ 2,000 ? Do they have to wait and include it on their next year 's tax return ? Which of these three options should the person choose ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : I thank the hon . member for his question , which is very relevant . In fact , that person must contact Service Canada or the Canada Revenue Agency , depending on the system under which he or she received this benefit , and ensure that , in the circumstances that apply to him or her , the decisions and actions taken are appropriate . Mr. Grard Deltell : It 's too bad , Mr.Chair , because it 's the boss who is in front of me , here in committee . It 's good that the citizen calls the public servant , but the public servant 's boss is the Treasury Board President . Can he give a clear indication to citizens ? What should they do now with the emergency assistance they received with this month 's benefit ? Should they keep it in full or pay it back now ? I 'd like a clear answer , please . Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : Again , I recognize the importance of insisting on clarity . What 's clear here is that each person must make decisions based on his or her own circumstances , and the responsible way to act is to interact with public servants at Service Canada or the Canada Revenue Agency . Mr. Grard Deltell : Service Canada employees must have clear instructions from their boss . The boss is here . This is the President of the Treasury Board . Could the President of the Treasury Board , in very clear terms , tell the employees answering questions from Canadians what they have to say to those currently receiving the Canada emergency response benefit , but who are actually at work ? These are honest people . They are not fraudsters . They want to comply with the law . Can the President of the Treasury Board give them clear instructions ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : That is extraordinary , because my colleague focused on two key terms : honesty and hard work . In terms of the honesty of Canadians , in all cases , I am convinced that they will contact the appropriate officials . As for the hard work of those officials , they know what they have to do and they have been doing it in an exemplary way since the crisis began . Mr. Grard Deltell : And yet those good officials , whom I frequently commend on social media for their excellent work , have no clear instructions from their boss . Mr.President , let me go back to the basic question . The National Post said that 200,000Canadians have used the emergency assistance fraudulently , to the tune of $ 1.6billion . Is that the case , yes or no ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : I am sure that the honourable member is not questioning the ability of Canada Revenue Agency officers to follow the very clear directive of ensuring that the mechanisms reflect the importance of maintaining the integrity of the Government of Canada during the exceptional circumstances we are experiencing . The Chair : We 'll now go on to Ms. Gray . Mrs. Tracy Gray (KelownaLake Country, CPC) : Mr . Chair , last week British Columbia unveiled its plan to begin reopening its economy . I 've been speaking with many business owners and business associations in my riding , and I 'm hearing that they 're not getting their orders for cleaning supplies . Some businesses have said their back orders go back to March . They do not know how they can possibly reopen if they are not meeting health cleaning standards or accessing PPE for their employees and customers . They are well aware of the issues arising from this government 's reliance on Chinese manufacturing rather than building capacity here . What is the government doing to address these issues and ensure wholesale supply companies get products now so that they can distribute them to the businesses that need them ? Hon. Anita Anand (Oakville, Lib.) : Mr . Chair , our government is rapidly and aggressively buying life-saving equipment that Canada needs from a diverse range of suppliers . We are building up domestic capacity as well as procuring internationally . Our priority is to make sure front-line health care workers have the support they need . In terms of other areas of the economy , we are working with our federal and provincial counterparts to make sure that we can do so in collaboration with them . Mrs. Tracy Gray : Mr . Chair , an ongoing concern I 've heard from small business owners is that they are ineligible for CEBA because they do n't have a business account . When I brought up this point to small business minister Ng at committee , she said it was the first time that she had heard of this issue and that she would follow up . I asked this question on April 23 , and it 's now been almost three weeks . Small business has been let down . Can the government confirm that they 're going to fix this issue ? Hon. Navdeep Bains (MississaugaMalton, Lib.) : Chair , I 'd like to thank the honourable member for her question . It is really important that this program that we 've established help small businesses . We have shown in the past that we 're very flexible and nimble in accommodating the needs of businesses . I assure the member opposite that we are looking into this matter and will come forward with a resolution in a timely manner . Mrs. Tracy Gray : Mr . Chair , I just read another email from a small business owner this morning who has been let down by the government . He chose to pay off debts instead of paying himself a wage ; therefore , he 's ineligible for CEBA , for that loan . Owner-operators have been eliminated from participating in government programs because they did not put themselves on the payroll . This shows a true lack of understanding of small businesses and especially of owner-operators . Will the government commit to fixing this issue ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Thank you very much . Again , I want to thank the honourable member for her question . We have focused particularly on small businesses to make sure they have the appropriate support they need . With regard to the program that she highlighted , we have shown flexibility in the eligibility criteria by decreasing the payroll threshold for individual companies that want to apply for this loan to $ 20,000 versus $ 50,000 , and the upper limit has gone to $ 1.5 million versus $ 1 million . We will continue to bring forward the changes necessary to have more businesses Mrs. Tracy Gray : This government has left Canadian craft breweries out to dry , like the hops in their beer . On April 24 , the Canadian Craft Brewers Association released a report on the effects of COVID-19 on the Canadian craft brewing industry . The report states that 38 % of craft brewers did not qualify for the Canadian emergency wage subsidy in March , and 53 % were either not sure or predicted that they would not qualify in April . Many a brew pub , like BNA in my riding , due to higher payrolls are also not eligible for the CEBA loan . They have been left out and let down . Five per cent of these breweries have already closed permanently , and others are on the verge of doing so . A portion have stepped up and are making PPE . Will this government take the initiative to support this industry by amending program requirements ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : When it comes to the Canada emergency wage subsidy , we have demonstrated flexibility and nimbleness . The program requirement changed in terms of revenue threshold . We originally had 30 % for the month of March . We changed that to 15 % . The eligibility criteria to compare to the first two months of this year now also compare to the previous year as well . We 're going to continue to make changes to make sure more businesses can access this program . The Chair : Ms. Gray , you have 33 seconds . Mrs. Tracy Gray : In my constituency , Okanagan fruit production is a huge industry , and many apple orchardists have brought concerns to me regarding high costs , apples from last season selling below cost , the CUSMA agreement not helping the industy , and low-priced Washington apples flooding our market . COVID-19 has exacerbated their dire financial situation . The BC Fruit Growers ' Association has called the government announcements of measures for agriculture underwhelming . I questioned Minister Bibeau in the House a couple of months ago , and at the time she did not have an answer . What is the plan to help our orchardists ? The Chair : The honourable minister . Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau (ComptonStanstead, Lib.) : Thank you , Mr.Chair . Since this crisis began , we have been helping entrepreneurs in all sectors . We began with measures to assist small , medium and large companies , and we are now going progressively sector by sector . Last week , we announced additional funding for agriculture The Chair : We 'll now go on to Mr. Barlow . Mr. John Barlow (Foothills, CPC) : Mr . Chair , in my riding of Foothills , we 've established a Foothills business recovery task force . We surveyed hundreds of small business owners about the effectiveness of the emergency programs put forward by the government . The results of that survey were quite alarming . More than half of the respondents have not qualified for any of the programs , and the vast majority of them have said their businesses will not last more than another month . Will the government expand the eligibility for some of these programs to include sole proprietorships , or is the government still looking at refunding the GST paid by some of the businesses over the last year ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , I want to highlight the fact that we have issued 590,000 loans through the CEBA account . This demonstrates that this particular program is working and that businesses are taking advantage of it . We recognize that we want to be more generous and more thoughtful about these programs . We 've demonstrated flexibility in the past and we will continue to be nimble going forward . Mr. John Barlow : Mr . Chair , to the Minister of Agriculture , Dr. Charlebois said that we are on the precipice of losing 15 % of our farms and that 30,000 farm families are at risk of bankruptcy . This will have a devastating effect on our rural economies . Does the minister know the impact that losing 30,000 family farms will have on our food security and the price of groceries on the store shelves ? Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : Mr.Chair , the agriculture and agri-food sector is extremely important . We have clearly stated that it is an essential service . That is why we have risk management programs that are already well established . I understand that producers would like the programs to be more generous , and we are ready to do more , but they first need to use those programs . They have $ 1.6billion available Mr. John Barlow : Mr . Chair , business risk management programs do n't apply to every single stakeholder and the programs are not working for the producers . There is a bottleneck right now in our processing capacity . When the minister renounced the AgriRecovery program , funds were set aside for cattle and pork producers . When is that money going to be available , and how long will it last ? Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : We are talking about two different programs here . We added $ 77.5million to the program helping the processing sector and $ 50million on two occasions for our pork and beef producers under the AgriRecovery program . Once again , that is additional money . In recent years , an average of $ 15million have gone out of this program , whereas this year The Chair : Mr. Barlow . Mr. John Barlow : Mr . Chair , it is not new money ; it has been budgeted year after year and it 's budgeted again for next year . The cattlemen said that the set-aside funds that the minister is talking about are already gone and did not last even two weeks . If this government is n't assisting Canadian farmers , is the government 's food policy to rely on food imported from foreign countries to feed Canadian families ? Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : Mr.Chair , the fund to assist our beef producers can not have already disappeared because the criteria will be unveiled in the coming days . I can assure you that we are working as efficiently as possible so that the program can be rolled out and the money can be channelled to our beef and pork producers . Mr. John Barlow : Mr . Chair , producers across this country have said that an exemption from the carbon tax would help them greatly during this pandemic . When I asked the minister about any data that was available for the impact the carbon tax had on agriculture , the answer I got was that this information was secret . Yesterday at committee , the minister said that this was a mistake and that this information has been public . My staff and I looked everywhere last night , as did journalists , and that information could not be found . Is that information actually available ? Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : Yes , Mr.Chair , that information is available and public . I will happily pass the information on to my colleague . Mr. John Barlow : If that data is available , then the minister must know the financial impacts that the carbon tax has on Canadian farmers . With the information that the minister apparently has , does she agree with the Prime Minister that Canadian farmers are much better off financially by paying the carbon tax ? Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : Thank you , Mr . Chair . Each organization analyzes different assumptions , methodologies and geographic areas , so the results give a broad range of estimated impacts . According to the organization that has provided information , in 2019 , the estimated impacts of a $ 20-per-tonne price on pollution due to grain drying ranged The Chair : We 'll go back to Mr. Barlow . You have 30 seconds , please . Mr. John Barlow : Does the minister agree with the Prime Minister that farmers are financially better off paying the carbon tax ? Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : Mr.Chair , the price on pollution is an extremely important measure for our economy in general and for our transition to a greener economy . We have already provided various exemptions to the agriculture sector : for gasoline , for the access card and for the greenhouse sector . The Chair : The next question goes to Mr. Kelly . Mr. Pat Kelly (Calgary Rocky Ridge, CPC) : Will the government fully fund the Office of the Auditor General ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : Thank you , Mr . Chair . The answer is that we have done that in 2018 and 2019 , and the Prime Minister Mr. Pat Kelly : Mr . Chair , I hope the minister would not want to mislead the House . The office is certainly not fully funded , as per the testimony we heard yesterday at the finance committee . This government has expanded the Auditor General 's responsibilities without adequate resources . When will the government fully fund the Auditor General ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : To continue my answer , and as the Prime Minister said just a moment ago , that has led to the hiring of 38 new staff members . That 's great to hear , because they are doing even better than they used to before we came into power . Mr. Pat Kelly : No previous auditor general in Canadian history has ever had to tell a parliamentary committee that they had insufficient funds to do their job . That is what in fact this Auditor General has done . When will the government fully fund the Office of the Auditor General ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : I 'm glad again to be given the ability to say how important the work of the Auditor General is . We believe very much in that role . That 's why we increased the funding that is necessary for that office to do its important job . We will keep working hard with the Auditor General . Mr. Pat Kelly : Sadly , Michael Ferguson passed away in 2019 , yet the government has refused to name a permanent replacement . Why ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : Mr . Chair , this is another wonderful opportunity to remind all members of this House of the importance of these institutions . When we face these tragic deaths , we of course are very sad of the passing of the people , and we work The Chair : Go ahead , Mr. Kelly . Mr. Pat Kelly : Yesterday the Parliamentary Budget Officer said that Canada 's debt could reach $ 1 trillion this year . What will it cost to service a $ 1-trillion debt ? Hon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance) : Mr. Speaker , we remain committed to doing , as we 've said , whatever it takes to support Canadians through this challenging time . We think this is extremely important , and we will continue to focus on the well-being of all Canadians . Mr. Pat Kelly : What is the estimated annual debt servicing cost of the aid measures announced so far ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , there will be an opportunity for us to give a full outline of the costs and benefits of our measures , and we will do that when we have the ability to have The Chair : Mr. Kelly . Mr. Pat Kelly : is Canada 's AAA credit rating . Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr. Speaker , Canada came into this crisis with a very strong fiscal position , and of course we will experience challenges as we move forward , but we believe that we should experience those challenges as we support Canadians . Mr. Pat Kelly : What would the effect of a downgrade be on Canada 's debt servicing costs ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , we will continue to focus on how we can support Canadians and Canadian businesses as we get through this challenge . Mr. Pat Kelly : How many private sector bank loans have been funded for small and medium-sized businesses under the business credit availability program ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , as the information on the business credit availability program becomes available , we are being fully transparent with the finance committee and with this House . Mr. Pat Kelly : Does the minister know how many loans have been funded under that program ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , I 'm not in the habit of memorizing every single number available to us , but what I can confirm is that we will be transparent with this House on the numbers as they become available . Mr. Pat Kelly : Does the minister know the dollar amount or the approximate dollar amount so far lent and guaranteed by Export Development Canada ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , one number that would probably be helpful for people to understand is that we 've now had over 550,000 approved loans under the CEBA program , representing over 20 billion dollars ' worth of money that 's actually The Chair : Mr. Kelly . Mr. Pat Kelly : Will the government fix the CEBA program to include businesses that pay owner-operators through dividends ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , I think the language fix is incorrect , for more than 500,000 businesses have received this loan . Of course , we are always endeavouring to make sure it works for as many businesses as possible . Mr. Pat Kelly : Will the government fix CEBA to cover small businesses that hire day labourers or subcontractors ? The Chair : The honourable minister . Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , again we 've demonstrated flexibility and nimbleness when it comes to this program . We changed the eligibility criteria to make sure that more businesses can apply and be eligible for this program . We will endeavour to make sure that more Canadians have access to this program , particularly small businesses in rural and remote communities . Mr. Pat Kelly : Will the government fix CEBA to cover business owners who use personal instead of business chequing accounts to operate their business ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Again , Mr . Chair , I want to highlight the fact that this has been a very positive program and well received by many small businesses . Over 590,000 small business loans have been issued , and that 's a testament to the design of the program . We 're going to make sure we continue to engage with small businesses . The Chair : The next question goes to Mr. Chong . Hon. Michael Chong (WellingtonHalton Hills, CPC) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . Last week , on Friday , Statistics Canada was to release labour force survey data at 8:30 a.m. eastern time , one of the most important and market-moving indicators of the month , but someone in the government leaked that information ahead of time , almost 45 minutes ahead of time , and exclusively to Bloomberg terminal users on Wall Street and on Bay Street , who pay thousands of dollars a month for those terminals . Moving markets , the Canadian dollar moved eight basis points in that short period of time and billions were made or lost on the market . Section 34 of the Statistics Act makes it a criminal offence for someone to leak information that might influence stock , bond or currency markets . Has the government notified the RCMP about what appears to be a criminal breach of the Statistics Act ? The Chair : The honourable minister . Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , I 'd like to thank the honourable member for his question . I , too , share the same concerns that he 's highlighted with regard to this leak . This is completely unacceptable . That is why we 're going to make sure that a proper and thorough examination is done , and going forward we want to make sure that no such breach or leak occurs . Hon. Michael Chong : Mr . Chair , Statistics Canada said that staffers and ministers ' offices , including the Prime Minister 's office , the finance minister 's office , the employment minister 's office and the industry minister 's office , would have received this secret information no earlier than 2 p.m. the previous day . Statistics Canada has also indicated that it has begun an internal investigation . Will the minister commit to fully co-operating with this investigation ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : I 'd like to remind the honourable colleague that our government has supported Statistics Canada . We 're the ones who reintroduced the mandatory long-form census . We 're the ones who funded more money for Statistics Canada . The member opposite knows that we 'll be fully co-operative in any such investigation into any leak . Hon. Michael Chong : Will the minister commit to making the results of this investigation public ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , the member opposite knows full well that there are proper processes and protocols in place when it comes to such sensitive matters , and we will ensure that those processes and protocols The Chair : Mr. Chong . Hon. Michael Chong : Mr . Chair , I hope there is no double standard for ministers ' offices and the public service , because it was only about 13 years ago that a public servant was criminally charged and convicted for using top secret information in the markets . I hope that in this investigation , and in the release of the information concerning this investigation , ministers ' staffers are n't held to a different standard than the public service has been held to . This leak speaks to the integrity of the government . Intelligence at the Five Eyes .... Our four allies have been telling us for years that one of the top two or three threats that democracies are facing is declining public confidence in our key institutions . Democracies have been blindsided by misinformation , disinformation and cyber-attacks , and now we are being blindsided by the misuse of information by this very government . That does n't even .... The government 's own national statistics-gathering agency does n't trust this cabinet or this government , and that 's why they announced several days ago that they would suspend the pre-release of information to the cabinet . What is the government going to do to restore public confidence in our institutions ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , our government has remained steadfast in its support for Statistics Canada . I 'd like to remind my honourable colleague that we are the government that brought forward legislation to strengthen the independence of Statistics Canada . We 're the government that brought forward measures to make sure they have additional monies for conducting the proper mandatory long-form census as well . When it comes to the leak that the member opposite is talking about , we 're not going to prejudge the outcome . We have been very clear that the proper processes and protocols that are in place will be followed . The Chair : You have time for a very brief question , Mr. Chong . Hon. Michael Chong : Mr . Chair , I hope the government will call the RCMP and notify them about what appears to be a criminal breach of the Statistics Act , because it was a previous Liberal minister who himself was subject to a lot of misinformation and was a target of improper allegations about his office 's use of information that leaked about the income trust changes that the previous Liberal government had brought in . The RCMP began an investigation and , in the course of the investigation , they charged a public servant who was ultimately convicted of breaching that secret information . I hope the minister holds his office and the offices of his cabinet colleagues to the same standard , calls in the RCMP and makes them aware of what appears to be a criminal breach of the Statistics Act . The Chair : The honourable minister , in 30 seconds or less , please . Hon. Navdeep Bains : I 'm sorry . How much time do I have , Mr . Chair ? The Chair : We 're over the time , but I 'm allowing 30 seconds so we can get a full Hon. Navdeep Bains : I appreciate that very much . Again , I want to take this opportunity to say that leaks of this nature are completely unacceptable . We 've been very clear that we are going to take the appropriate steps . Statistics Canada is taking the appropriate steps . I want to remind the member opposite that we 're not going to prejudge any outcome at this stage . Again , it is our government that has been consistently supporting Statistics Canada in its work through the previous years . The Chair : Thank you . We 'll take a short break to allow our console operators to switch in a healthy way . While we 're doing that , I 'm going to mention something . It happens at the end of a question . When there 's less than a minute left and the question goes over half the time left over , I 'll just indicate to the person asking the question that we 've reached the limit so that the other side can answer with the same amount of time and we have a fair playing field . We 're ready to go again . The Honourable Member for BeloeilChambly has the floor . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Thank you , Mr.Chair . We are making progress , but unfortunately , I 'd like to hear it in French as well . I will address my question to the Prime Minister . First , let me remind you that , on March12 , the government announced a first series of measures of about $ 1billion to adapt to what was at the time the beginning of the coronavirus crisis , including $ 500million in transfers to the provinces , with about $ 100million going to Quebec . Since that time , the commitments from the government have reached very probably around $ 300billion , making those first $ 500 million pale by comparison . Of course , the crisis became longer and it is not over yet . In that context , and given what I heard the Prime Minister say a little earlier about respecting the areas of jurisdiction of the provinces , and of Quebec , can we expect a speedy increase in health transfers to Quebec and the provinces , an increase that would be permanent , and , of course , without conditions ? The Chair : The honourable minister has the floor . Hon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health) : Thank you , Mr.Chair . We 've increased health transfers to provinces and territories significantly since we first came into government in 2015 . We continue to work with provinces and territories on a regular basis to make sure they 're supported not just in the outbreak of this pandemic , but in the increased cost overall to health care across the country . Our investments have included investments for mental health , for home care and for the additional expenses that provinces and territories face as a result of an aging population . We 'll continue to work with provinces and territories to ensure those health care needs are met . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : With all respect , Mr.Chair , that is a little disappointing . While the leader of the NDP wants the federal government to interfere massively in provincial jurisdiction over health , the Prime Minister replies in English . That is perfectly legitimate in this Parliament , but his reply in English is , no , the government absolutely respects provincial jurisdiction . That made me happy for a brief moment , and I am asking the Prime Minister , without wanting to interrupt his precious reading , to please repeat in French was he said just now in English , that he absolutely respects provincial jurisdiction over health , which is exclusive . So could you please provide that music to my ears ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , just as I respect the member opposite 's right to speak in his first language , I hope that he understands that I am trying to learn our second official language in a high-pressure situation , and it often creates anxiety . I will tell him , though , that we fully respect the jurisdiction of provinces and territories to address the needs of their constituents and their members , and we work very closely with Quebec and with all provinces and territories to make sure that the funds we transfer from the federal government can be utilized in a way that best meets the needs of their constituents . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Let 's not get into that . It says to me that French is the second official language . Well , it 's my first official language and it 's the first one in Quebec . I would like to have heard that in French . I would like to have heard it from the Prime Minister , because it 's a constitutional issue . Basically , you could say that it 's our heritage . So that is what I would like to have heard . Let me proceed with a short and simple question : is health in the exclusive jurisdiction of the provinces in the current crisis management situation ? Hon. Pablo Rodriguez (Leader of the Government in the House of Commons) : Mr.Chair , I would like to tell my colleague that we have no first or second official language . We have two official languages . They have the same value and the same importance . They deserve the same respect in the House and in the institutions of the government . We are always happy to collaborate with the provinces and to respect their jurisdictions . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Hearing that we have no first or second official language is better already . Between friends , let 's say that they are equal . Let us take it one step further : is health in the jurisdiction of Quebec and the provinces ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , we live in a federation where we work closely together with provinces and territories so that we can reach our mutually important goals , one of which is that all citizens of Canada , all members of Canada , have access to a public health care system that meets their needs . We continue to work within the constitutional framework The Chair : Excuse me , but I have to interrupt you . Mr.Blanchet , you have 21seconds left . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : The answer could be even shorter than the question . Is health in provincial jurisdiction ? Will there be an increase in the health transfers and will they come without conditions ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , I am sure the member would argue that it is important to work together . The federal government transfers money to the provinces , as he is well aware , to deliver health care , which is within each province 's and territory 's jurisdiction . The Chair : We now move to Mrs.Gill . Mrs. Marilne Gill (Manicouagan, BQ) : Thank you , Mr.Chair . As the member for Manicouagan , I would like to address the House today on a matter that is very important in my constituency . At 350,000square kilometres , it borders the Gulf of St.Lawrence . Regionally , I am also in eastern Quebec , which includes the Gasp , the Magdalen Islands , and the Lower St.Lawrence . These are regions whose economy rests basically on two very important seasonal industries : tourism and fishing . Make no mistake , it is not the workers who are seasonal , it is the industry itself , as our former leader Gilles Duceppe so rightly used to say . Those industries are very important for that region of Quebec , but I see no measures to support them that accommodate all their uniqueness . These are cyclical industries , meaning that they operate at a very specific period during the year . A few minutes ago , I heard the Prime Minister say that he had intervened to help the companies and the workers in those seasonal industries . I would like to know what the specific assistance is and how it is tailored to the companies and the workers in the seasonal industries he mentions . Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr.Chair , I would like to thank my colleague for her question . We know that the current situation is causing upheaval in the lives of Canadians from one end of the country to the other and that it is having a major impact on our small and medium businesses . Since this crisis began , we have not hesitated to implement strong and speedy measures to support more Canadians . That is what we will continue to do . We know that the tourism sector is key to a number of communities in the country . We must help them to get through this crisis as best we can . We are continuing to have discussions and to tailor our measures so that as many Canadians as possible can take advantage of them . Mrs. Marilne Gill : Mr.Chair , with all respect , I am hearing that nothing has been done . Measures have been proposed , but , as I understand it , they are not specific to the seasonal sectors . Let us take the seasonal fishing industry . The fishers are currently going out , but right in the middle of the COVID-19 crisis . One fishing season has been pushed back . The same thing applies to tourism . The season will be pushed back , and it is possible that there may even not be one . The people and the companies in this sector have no second chances . They can not start again in the fall . It 's a bit like agriculture . They ca n't start a fishing season or a tourist season in the fall . So they need assistance . We have some proposals . For example , would the government be prepared to let the Canada emergency response benefit provide workers with eligibility to employment insurance benefits ? They could then get through the coming year and make it to next season . Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : Mr.Chair , I want to thank the member for speaking about the situation in all regions of Canada , particularly in Quebec . From the start , we 've been implementing significant measures to support the millions of workers who are currently struggling . We 've taken significant measures with respect to tourism , agriculture and regional development . We 're providing broader investments , such as the wage subsidy and emergency loans for small businesses , of which there are many in my colleague 's constituency . We 'll continue to work very hard so that the workers and businesses in her constituency can get through this crisis and emerge stronger and more united . Mrs. Marilne Gill : Mr.Chair , that 's strike two . This is the second time that I 've asked a question about targeted assistance for the seasonal industry . My honourable colleague 's response does n't make me feel any better . The workers in the industry also do n't feel any better when they see that , at the end of the summer , they 'll have no job and no money to put food on the table . Will these workers receive assistance adapted to their needs ? It 's the same thing for businesses . We 're currently talking about the businesses in my constituency , but there are also businesses in the East . Quebec and Canada as a whole , both in terms of fishing and tourism The Chair : The honourable President of the Treasury Board has the floor . Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : Thank you , Mr.Chair . My colleague probably knows the information that I 'll be giving . The Canada Emergency Response Benefit is available to all individuals who have n't been receiving employment insurance benefits since December2019 . A number of stakeholders in Canada and Quebec called for this , particularly in the places The Chair : The next question goes to Mr. Singh . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : Thank you very much , Mr . Chair . The Prime Minister announced the business bailout , and in that proposal , he said that there would be limits on CEO bonuses and share buybacks . By saying limits , the Prime Minister is suggesting that there would be some amount of bonuses or share buybacks that could be paid for with public dollars . If that 's the case , how much ? The Chair : The honourable minister . Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , we believe that it 's very important that we support jobs . In that regard , we 're trying to make sure that businesses can get through this time . As we provide that support , we 've been very clear for large enterprises that share buybacks will not be allowed , period , and that there will , of course , be limitations on total compensation for senior executives in order to give Canadians confidence that we 're doing the things we need to do to support them , but that we 're not supporting executives . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : Mr . Chair , Germany has actually taken the lead and said that if a company wants public money , then its executives must commit to reducing their pay . Will Canada follow Germany to ensure that public dollars go to workers and not to enrich the executive suite , and commit that no public money will go to bonuses or increasing salaries for executives ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , we are looking forward to releasing the complete details of the large employer emergency financing facility , and I think the member opposite will be quite pleased to see that we will be leading on behalf of Canada in advance of what Germany is doing . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : Mr . Chair , we know the PBO has said that $ 25 billion , at least , is being lost to our revenues because corporations are avoiding paying their fair share . Will the Prime Minister commit today very clearly that if a company is hiding its money by putting it in an offshore tax haven , that company will not receive public help , yes or no ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , again with regard to this program , we want to be very clear that the support that goes to large businesses actually supports their Canadian enterprises and their Canadian employees . In that regard , we will not allow any company that has been convicted of tax evasion to have access to these funds , and we will carefully evaluate on an ongoing basis to make sure that companies remain eligible for this support based on their continuing investment in Canada . The Chair : Mr. Singh . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : Mr . Chair , how many companies can the Minister of Finance name that have been convicted of tax evasion that would be denied help under this program ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , I think what 's most important is that we focus on Canadians . We 're trying to support Canadians , whether they 're working for small or large businesses , so they can get through this , can support their families during this time , and come out with a job at the end of it . That is exactly where our focus lies in this regard . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : Mr . Chair , not a single company . We are four years past the Panama papers and there has n't been a single conviction . Those are simply fancy Liberal words saying that a company that has been convicted of tax evasion .... There are simply no companies that this government can give as an example . Why do n't we follow what France has done and commit very clearly , not in Liberal fancy words but straight up , if a company is hiding its money by using offshore tax havens , it will not get public help . Will the minister commit to that right now ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , we 've been working with France and other countries to make these rules stricter for businesses . The process around the common reporting standard and the base erosion profit shifting has made it more difficult for firms to move money into tax havens , and it has ensured that we have transparency in seeing when they do so . We 'll continue to do that hard work to make sure that businesses abide by the rules and pay their appropriate part of taxes in our country . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : Mr . Chair , let 's talk about hard work . If a company is not convicted of tax evasion , but is putting its money in Barbados or Bermuda , for example , specifically to avoid paying taxesand we have a similar example of Loblaws doing something like thiswill that company , despite not having a conviction , but clearly having avoided paying their fair share by putting their money in an offshore tax haven , receive help , yes or no ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , I 'd suggest that the member be very careful in accusing companies of wrongdoing . We have a country that respects international rules . We allow our companies to trade and do business around the world . That continues to be important , and that supports Canadian jobs . At the same time , we 're trying to make sure those international rules work and get tighter . That 's what we 've been working on . We 'll continue to do that because we know it 's important that we can work internationally . It 's important that companies pay their fair share here in Canada . The Chair : The next question goes to Mr. Hoback . Mr. Randy Hoback (Prince Albert, CPC) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . The Liberals hand-picked ambassador to China , Dominic Barton , stated that China 's conduct during the pandemic is damaging to its own soft power . However , when asked if there should be an investigation into China 's behaviour during the crisis , the health minister stated that 's not for her to say because she does n't have all the evidence about what China did or did n't do . Why is Canada 's ambassador to China criticizing China 's actions during the pandemic while this Liberal government is defending it ? The Chair : The honourable Deputy Prime Minister . Hon. Chrystia Freeland (UniversityRosedale, Lib.) : Mr . Chair , Ambassador Barton is an excellent representative of Canada in China , and he is a member of our government and very much shares and helps to formulate our government 's policy when it comes to China . Ambassador Barton , of course , shares our government 's view that a post-crisis review is absolutely necessary . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , the government 's March 27 duty deferral announcement has caused tension within the trade community . Customs brokers are being asked to shoulder tremendous liability as importers are not required to make duty payments until the end of June , when there is a real possibility that some of them may find themselves insolvent . Will the government commit to a liability exemption for customs brokers whose clients are unable to pay the duties at the end of June ? The Chair : The honourable minister . Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , we have worked hard to determine programs that we think can be supportive of individuals and businesses , including allowing for deferral of taxes through this period . That we believe is important with respect to the GST , which we 've allowed to be deferred until July 1 , and in terms of taxes for businesses , until the end of August . We think this helps businesses to get through this challenging time , and we 'll continue to support businesses and individuals so we can have a strong economy when we get through this crisis . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , the following three questions are from constituents in my riding , so hopefully , I 'll get some good answers for them . The first one I 'll talk about is Rick . He owns a small business , a local bowling alley , in Melfort . It 's a family-owned operation , so he does n't meet the payroll threshold for the wage subsidy benefit , nor does he qualify for any other announced loans or grants . There are businesses right across Canada that are in similar situations . Is the minister suggesting that they lie to get the funds , or will they make some changes so they qualify ? The Chair : The honourable minister . Hon. Navdeep Bains : I want to highlight some of the initiatives we have put forward to assist small businesses . The Canada emergency wage subsidy covers 75 % of the wages of employees , and that way they can maintain their jobs . We 've also put forward the enhanced work-sharing program . It 's an option for businesses to pay their employees . On top of that , I want to highlight the Canada emergency business account , which has issued 590,000 loans . As the Minister of Finance recently mentioned , we 've deferred GST and HST and customs duty payments for businesses for the next three months . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , Robert owns a cleaning products company in Prince Albert . He tells me that Canadian custodians and building service contractors are not purchasing Canadian-made disinfectants because very few are included in the federal approval list for COVID-19 , even though Canada produces many products that Health Canada has certified as disinfectants . Why is the Liberal government not prioritizing the approval of Canadian-made products ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , that assertion is not correct . In fact , we have been working very closely with producers of Canadian products as well as with our colleagues at Innovation , Science and Economic Development to make sure that Canadian companies have what they need to very quickly move through the approval process . Health Canada has accelerated this process , and most companies can get approved in one to seven days . Of course , there is an iterative process that requires companies to ensure that a product is safe for use in Canada . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , last week the government announced $ 252 million in assistance for Canadian farmers , which was largely seen as an insult , especially given that a good amount of this money was already budgeted . A constituent of mine , Tracy , from Melfort , wrote to me asking me to advocate for farmers and ranchers so they can get the support they need to continue to produce our food . When will the government start to prioritize farmers and ranchers ? Will they continue to reform the business risk management program ? Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : Absolutely , Mr.Chair . We 're working very hard with our provincial colleagues to improve the risk management programs . We did announce programs last week , and some of these new programs are designed specifically for the meat sector . A total of $ 77.5million is earmarked for processors and $ 50million for beef producers . The Chair : The next question goes to Mr. Calkins . Mr. Blaine Calkins (Red DeerLacombe, CPC) : Mr . Chair , provinces are reopening at different speeds , and that includes opening their provincial parks before the May long weekend . It no longer makes sense for fully staffed national parks across the country to be uniformly closed . Will the Minister of Environment commit to opening national parks in harmony with provincial and territorial parks across Canada ? Hon. Chrystia Freeland : Mr . Chair , we are working very closely with our provincial partners on the reopening . I am pleased that we were able to publish , on Tuesday , April 28 , shared guidelines on the reopening , which were supported by the Prime Minister and all of the premiers of the provinces and territories The Chair : Mr. Calkins . Mr. Blaine Calkins : Mr . Chair , boating is a safe way to enjoy the outdoors while maintaining physical distancing . Why is Parks Canada postponing the opening of lock operations and similar functions along our heritage waterways ? Hon. Chrystia Freeland : Mr . Chair , as I was saying in my answer to the first question , the question of coordinating national and provincial parks is a very good one . That is something we are definitely working on . Mr. Blaine Calkins : Mr . Chair , since the beginning of this pandemic , the minority Liberal government has been actively trying to push our democracy aside . It severely limited parliamentary sittings , attempted to take executive control of tax rates and used an order in council to ban lawfully acquired and responsibly owned firearms . When will the government stop using this pandemic as an excuse to run roughshod over our cherished democratic values ? Hon. Pablo Rodriguez : I do n't understand this question at all , since we 're meeting here to ask questions for twohours and 15minutes . That 's the equivalent of three question periods . Yesterday , there was the equivalent of two question periods , and tomorrow there will be the equivalent of two more question periods . We 're talking about seven question periods . That 's more than normal . Mr. Blaine Calkins : Mr . Chair , the inconsistency in support for various sectors in our economy is baffling . There is more money made available to forcibly confiscate lawfully owned property than in emergency support for our hard-working farmers or our prosperity-creating oil and gas sector . The only consistent theme appears to be that sectors that do not traditionally vote Liberal are finding themselves left out in the cold . If that is not the case , why is there such an obvious discrepancy ? Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : Mr.Chair , those comments are completely unjustified . We 're fully committed to our sectors , including the energy sector and the agriculture and agrifood sector . This is particularly important . These sectors are critical . That 's why we 're working to improve our risk management programs . We want to ensure that the criteria are broader and that more producers can benefit from these programs . Mr. Blaine Calkins : Mr . Chair , during the misinformation briefing , the public safety minister used Australia , New Zealand and the United Kingdom as examples for firearms policy . Does the public safety minister realize that these countries are islands and none share a border with anyone , least of which with the United States of America ? Is my bringing this new-found evidence to the minister 's attention going to change his focus to smugglers , gangs and criminals , instead of wrongfully blaming lawful gun owners ? Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) : Mr . Chair , I would like to assure the member that I have actually seen an atlas . I want to be very clear that those countries have recognized , like Canada has , that these weapons have no place in a civil society . They were designed for soldiers to engage in combat with other soldiers . They were not designed for hunting and sporting purposes , which are the lawful uses of a firearm in Canada , but rather for individuals to kill other individuals . Tragically , in Canada , Australia , New Zealand and the United Kingdom , that is precisely what they have been used for , and we have prohibited The Chair : Mr. Calkins . Mr. Blaine Calkins : Mr . Chair , the nine o'clock gun is an iconic 12-pound cannon that has been fired daily in Vancouver in Stanley Park since the 1800s . It 's now a prohibited firearm as of May 1 , 2020 . Can the minister advise the public of the safety risks that this cannon , which was manufactured in 1816 , poses to the public ? Hon. Bill Blair : Mr . Chair , I assume the member opposite is referring to the prohibition of grenade launchers . There are about 34 in Canada and we have brought in regulations that now prohibit grenade launchers . It does not apply to some of the other things that have been suggested by the member opposite . Mr. Blaine Calkins : Mr . Chair , I was referring to the iconic , heritage 12-pound cannon that is mounted on a pedestal in Stanley Park . It was manufactured in 1816 . Any cannon that can be fired can be loaded with a projectile , so it meets the definition of a firearm , which means that every cannon in Canada , every heritage piece that might be in a museum , every heritage piece that might be in a collection , is now a prohibited firearm . Was the minister not aware of this when he announced this policy ? Hon. Bill Blair : Mr . Chair , just to help the member opposite , let us be very clear . We have prohibited weapons that were unfortunately widely available in Canada and were being used for purposes other than sporting activities , which is the only use of a firearm in Canada , for either hunting or target shooting sporting activities . Rather , they were being used to harm individual Canadians and , in some tragic cases , many individual Canadians . We 've done the right thing , Mr . Chair , and we The Chair : We 'll go to Mr. Nater next . Mr. John Nater (PerthWellington, CPC) : Mr . Chair , agricultural societies across rural Ontario are making the difficult decision to cancel their fall fairs this year . Some of these fall fairs have been around since before Confederation . Not only is this a terrible loss for these communities of important community events , but it 's also putting a significant financial strain on these agricultural societies . What action is the government taking to support agricultural societies in Canada ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , what we 've done is we 've put forward monies to support our regional development agencies . These agencies have the mandate and the ability to support local initiatives , including the events the member has highlighted . This is more than doubling the budget that currently exists , so that we have sufficient resources to support communities and these very important local events . Mr. John Nater : Mr . Chair , the arts and culture industry has a massive impact on local economies . In my riding alone we have the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum , the Stratford Festival , Drayton Entertainment and Stratford Summer Music . The postponement and cancellation of the seasons of these important cultural institutions is having a massive impact on the hospitality industry , including local restaurants , hotels and bed and breakfasts . Many of these businesses are small businesses and owner-operated businesses that are falling through the cracks in the government 's programs that have been introduced . How will the government address the blind spot in their programs for small businesses in communities like this , which rely on the tourism and the arts and culture industries ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , clearly , we understand how important these organizations are to these communities . That is why we allocated $ 500 million to respond to the specific financial needs of arts , heritage and sports organizations , to help them be more resilient through this difficult time . Last week we rolled out the funding of this announcement , and we look forward to engaging with communities across the country . Mr. John Nater : Mr . Chair , 1.8 million jobs are attributed to the tourism industry in Canada . Among these , 740,000 are related to international travelling . No one wants to see the borders reopen until it 's safe to do so , but can the government provide clarity on what criteria will be used to provide some information to these tourism operators of how , when and under what criteria international borders will be reopened ? Hon. Chrystia Freeland : Mr . Chair , I would like to thank the member opposite for his view that we need to be cautious and prudent and put the health and safety of Canadians first . That is very much the view of our government as well . When it comes to international borders , the health and safety of Canadians is absolutely the first criterion we are going to look at . Of course , we will be looking at the situation with coronavirus The Chair : We 'll go back to Mr. Nater . Mr. John Nater : Mr . Chair , many Canadians continue to fall through the cracks of programs announced by this government . One of my constituents only recently returned to the workforce after spending many years out of the workforce raising her children . As such , she does n't qualify under the $ 5,000 minimum requirement for income over the past 12 months . How will the government address these people who are falling through the cracks ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : Mr . Chair , we are mindful of the very difficult circumstances in which many Canadians who have a foot in two places find themselves . We have a number of different measures to help them and we 're going to continue to do so . Mr. John Nater : Mr . Chair , it has been reported that as many as 15 % of farmers and farm families in Canada could face going out of business and bankruptcy because of the massive impact that COVID-19 is having on agriculture in Canada . Business risk management programs are not working for these farm families , and the processing capacity is simply not there for farmers and for farm families , especially in the beef and pork industries . How will the government immediately address the short-term processing capacity issues found in the beef and pork sectors ? When will they finally live up to the commitment of a complete review of the business risk management programs ? Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : Mr.Chair , I 've been holding discussions with my provincial counterparts to review the risk management programs . With respect to the AgriStability program , we 've offered producers some accommodations and pushed back the enrolment date to July3 . We 've also increased , from 50 % to 75 % , the advance payment that they can obtain quickly , in provinces where this is possible . We 've also posted a calculator online . So before they say that the program is n't working , I encourage them to use this calculator to find out how much they can receive . Mr. John Nater : Mr . Chair , this government continues to show a blind spot for small businesses in Canada . Many do n't qualify for the CEBA because they do n't have a high enough payroll or because they do n't have a business account . So many small businesses are falling through the cracks . Will the government expand the criteria so that small businesses in my community and across Canada can qualify for the important assistance they need at this time ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , I would like to remind my honourable colleague that we did expand the eligibility criteria threshold from $ 50,000 down to $ 20,000 so that more businesses could be eligible , and on the top end , for salaries , from $ 1 million to $ 1.5 million . That is why we have seen 590,000 small business loans issued . That 's a testament to the program . The Chair : The next question will go to Mr. Maguire . Mr. Larry Maguire (BrandonSouris, CPC) : Mr . Chair , hog and beef producers have seen drastic price drops . Producers are telling me that they would use the western livestock price insurance program if the premiums were affordable , which they are not . Will the Minister of Agriculture work with the industry to make the premiums affordable so that producers can have price protection against these market fluctuations ? Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : Mr . Chair , we 're working closely with the industry and my provincial counterparts to identify the best programs to help producers in this difficult time . Last week , we announced specific programs for the meat sector : $ 77.5million for processors , $ 50million for beef producers and $ 50million for pork producers . Mr. Larry Maguire : Mr . Chair , Chez Angela Bakery in Brandon has seen tremendous success since it opened two years ago . Due to this growth and the eligibility criteria for the wage subsidy program , their revenues would have to decline much further than 30 % in order for them to receive help . Will the Minister of Finance amend the eligibility for the wage subsidy program so that Chez Angela and similar businesses can apply ? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton (Simcoe North, CPC)) : The honourable Minister of Industry . Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , I 'd like to thank the honourable member for his question . I want to highlight the fact that we did make an amendment . When we originally proposed this initiative , the threshold was 30 % for the month of March . Now businesses will only need to show a 15 % decline in revenue , and businesses will have the option of using January and February as a reference period to show revenue losses , or of using the same time last year . This reflects , again , our ability to understand the needs of businesses , to act quickly and to make sure that they benefit from this very important initiative . Mr. Larry Maguire : They still do n't qualify , Mr . Chair . The Blarney Stone restaurant in Killarney has repeatedly asked the Minister of Finance if they could refinance their loans through the Canada small business financing program . Will the Minister of Finance give small business owners the ability to refinance their existing loans through the program , yes or no ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , again , we 've demonstrated flexibility and nimbleness when it comes to these financing options . I 'd also like to highlight another very important initiative that was mentioned earlier , the deferring of GST/HST and customs duty payments for businesses for the next three months . This will help 3.2 million business owners and entrepreneurs across the country . Again , it 's another initiative to put more money in the pockets of businesses as they deal with this unprecedented health care crisis . Mr. Larry Maguire : Mr . Chair , the Liberals still have n't fixed the payroll eligibility problems for many small business owners who need to access the zero-interest loans available in CEBA . Can the minister provide any rationale for why countless small businesses are not being allowed to access these loans ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , as of today , 590,000 small business loans have been issued . I think that 's contrary to the point the member opposite is making . Clearly we recognize that we need to be agile and that we need to understand the needs of businesses . That 's why we made changes to this particular program . We 'll continue to listen to businesses . I can assure the member opposite that 590,000 small business loans is no small feat . Mr. Larry Maguire : Mr . Chair , Canada has some of the best competitive sport shooters in the world . The Liberals ' order in council on firearms will put an end to many Canadians being able to represent our country . Can the Minister of Public Safety list even one of these sport shooting competitions , which will now be illegal due to his order in council ? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : The honourable Minister of Public Safety . Hon. Bill Blair : Mr . Chair , it 's an important question because sport shooting is a very important tradition for many Canadian sport shooters . I want to assure the member opposite that the weapons we have prohibited by this order in council were not designed for sport shooting and are not used in the Olympics or Paralympic Games . They are not included in this and therefore have no impact on that activity of legitimate sport shooting . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : You have time for one more short question , Mr. Maguire . Mr. Larry Maguire : Mr . Chair , statistics show that women are more likely to live paycheque to paycheque , so women continue to be disproportionately impacted by this pandemic in a negative way . Many are worried they wo n't have a job to go back to . Will the government commit to helping women who are bearing this financial burden return to the workforce ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : Mr . Chair , this is a very good question . I would love to have a lot of time to answer it . The answer is yes , of course . We are making sure that many of our measures do not disproportionately impact women , because when women succeed , all Canadians succeed . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll now continue with Mr.Blanchette-Joncas . Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas (Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLes Basques, BQ) : Thank you , Mr.Chair . It 's a privilege to be here in the House today to represent the people of Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLesBasques , but also to serve as the BlocQubcois tourism critic . Tourism in Quebec is a significant economic engine and wealth creator . This industry is vital to the regions of Quebec , as I 'll demonstrate . The tourism industry in Quebec generates over $ 15billion in economic spinoffs and employs more than 400,000workers . In Quebec , one in tenjobs is connected to the tourism industry . Every dollar spent on tourism generates about 70cents in the Quebec economy . The tourism industry consists of over 30,000businesses , and two-thirds of these businesses are outside the major centres in the Quebec City and Montreal regions . In the tourism industry , 82 % of businesses have fewer than 20employees . This shows once again the need to support this industry . I heard my honourable colleague on the other side of the House say that a plan was in place for the tourism industry . I want to hear what he has to say about this plan . To date , what specific measures has the government taken to support the tourism industry ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr.Chair , I want to thank my colleague for his question . He 's right . The situation is very difficult for all regions of our country and for Quebec . That 's why we 've invested in regional development . These investments will improve the situation in the tourism sector . These investments will provide assistance for festivals , programs and other initiatives . We 'll continue to work with my colleague and the other members to find solutions that will improve the situation . Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas : Mr.Chair , I 'm not sure that I fully understood the plan . However , I can say that the people in the tourism industry do n't understand the plan , because they 're still waiting for it . One issue in the tourism industry involves fixed costs . Initially , we asked that part of the wage subsidy be set aside to cover fixed costs . The government implemented the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance . The assistance covers 75 % of commercial rental payments under $ 50,000 , and property owners pay the remaining 25 % . To date , how many applications have been submitted under this program ? Hon. Bill Morneau : The wage subsidy is very significant . However , we know that there are other fixed costs . That 's why we 've taken other measures , such as the measures related to credit and rent . We 've combined several measures that will help companies bridge the gap until the end of the crisis . Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas : We expect to hear a figure and not necessarily words . We could see that the program was ineffective , particularly for seasonal businesses , including businesses in the tourism industry . Businesses need to have suspended operations or to show a decline of at least 70 % in operations since the start of the public health crisis . How can a tourism business that has n't yet launched operations show a decline of 70 % ? It does n't make sense . A recent survey conducted by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business shows that only one in ten businesses can benefit from this assistance . Yet these businesses need the assistance . Does the government believe that commercial rent assistance is effective even though only one in ten businesses can benefit from it ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr.Chair , I know that the situation is very difficult . That 's why we 've introduced another option . Through the community futures development corporations and business development centres , we 're providing $ 71million to businesses and organizations in rural communities by giving them much-needed access to capital . This investment will help many businesses in Quebec , particularly in the tourism sector . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Mr.Blanchette-Joncas , you have one minute left . Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas : Mr.Chair , in my humble opinion , one out of ten businesses amounts to 10 % . This figure is n't very high and is far from a passing grade . What does the government plan to do ? Does it plan to implement an expanded program to support businesses in the tourism and seasonal industries to ensure that fixed costs are more fully covered ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr.Chair , we have a strategy . We 've invested in regional development and in small and medium-sized businesses . We 've helped the workers and we 'll continue to work with the provincial governments to find solutions . We must work together , particularly in the tourism sector , because the situation in the sector is very serious . I 'm sure that we can find solutions to help improve the situation for people in the tourism sector . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We will now continue with Mr. Van Bynen . Mr. Tony Van Bynen (NewmarketAurora, Lib.) : Mr . Chair , I would like to inform you that I will be splitting my time with the member for Kingston and the Islands . Mr . Chair , last week was Mental Health Week . We know that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great deal of stress and uncertainty for all Canadians and that during this uncertain time , it is normal for many people to feel increased anxiety , depression and mental health issues . In fact , a poll by the Canadian Mental Health Association 's Ontario branch showed that 61 % of respondents were worried about the mental health of a loved one and more than half of the respondents were worried about their own mental health . In the Standing Committee on Health , we 've also heard from many witnesses that our front-line heroes , working around the clock to protect us from the virus and to help others recover , are at great risk of physical and mental burnout . This shows how seriously Canadians need supports for their mental health and well-being during this most trying time . Can the Minister of Health tell my constituents what the government is doing to support Canadians during this uncertain time ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , I thank the member for NewmarketAurora for that very insightful question . In fact , we 've been very worried about Canadians ' mental health as resulting from the pandemic , but even prior to that we knew that we needed to create rapidly more tools for Canadians across the country , no matter where they lived . We 've worked very closely with our provincial and territorial partners , for example , to amplify the work that they 're doing through increased supports , financial supports . We also launched Wellness Together Canada , which is a digital portal , where all Canadians can get access to tools they can use to help with the circumstances they find themselves in and to get the information they need during COVID-19 . It also allows Canadians to connect to paid professionals who can provide support in a variety of different ways , whether it 's over the telephone , through email or by text , understanding that Canadians have different ways of connecting that work for them . We 've also partnered with a number of organizations that provide supports to Canadians , many of the crisis hotlines , for example , that are working double-time or triple-time to try to keep up with the volume of demand . This is a difficult time for all Canadians and we will continue to work to ensure Canadians have the supports they need . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll go to Mr. Gerretsen , from Kingston and the Islands . Mr. Mark Gerretsen (Kingston and the Islands, Lib.) : Mr . Chair , students from across the country have been significantly impacted by the effects of COVID-19 . As we know , thousands of post-secondary students depend on employment throughout the summer in order to pay for expenses throughout their academic year . Unfortunately the pandemic has resulted in the closure of many businesses and organizations that would normally employ students who work during the summer . Thousands of students are now left without the financial means they were depending on to pay for their post-secondary educational expenses . In response to the concerns raised by students , the government announced the creation of the Canada emergency student benefit , which will provide students with the assistance they need to make it through these uncertain financial times . I represent a riding that has multiple post-secondary institutions , and my constituents have been asking when they should expect to apply for the Canada emergency student benefit . Can the President of the Treasury Board please give us an update on the status of the Canada emergency student benefit , and in particular , when students will be able to start accessing this benefit , and also confirm if and how it may be retroactive ? Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : Mr . Chair , I would first like to thank the member for Kingston and the Islands for his strong advocacy in favour of young Canadians in his riding and across Canada . Mr . Chair , our government is committed to ensuring that young Canadians have the support that they need during this very difficult time . That 's why we are investing $ 9 billion to support students and recent graduates affected by COVID-19 . The measures include doubling the Canada student grants , raising the cap on student loans , creating new employment opportunities for students and launching the Canada emergency student benefit . I 'm pleased to share with the House that the application period for the Canada emergency student benefit will commence on May 15 . That is this Friday . This benefit will provide $ 1,250 a month to eligible students or $ 2,000 for students who have disabilities or dependants . Mr . Chair , when Canada emerges from this pandemic , we want to make sure that students are in a financial position to continue their studies so that they can pursue fruitful careers and help build a strong Canada . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll wait a few seconds before moving on to the next five-minute period to allow the console operator to switch with someone else . We 'll next go to the honourable member for Calgary Skyview , Ms. Sahota . Ms. Jag Sahota (Calgary Skyview, CPC) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . Victims of human trafficking continue to suffer during this crisis . Many are facing worse conditions and additional barriers to escaping human trafficking than before the pandemic . The government has been completely silent on this issue , and now funding to fight human trafficking is being taken away from front-line organizations . Why would the government choose to do this at this vulnerable time ? Hon. Bill Blair : Mr . Chair , human trafficking is , as we all know , one of the most heinous crimes imaginable . Our government is working to eliminate all instances of it . To combat human trafficking , we 've launched a comprehensive national strategy that brings together federal efforts under one strategic framework . We have backed that new move with $ 75 million in additional investments , and the new strategy now strengthens Canada 's ability to fight this abhorrent attack on human rights and human dignity . Ms. Jag Sahota : Mr . Chair , this simply is n't good enough . The government is letting down our most vulnerable Canadians . We know that human trafficking has n't stopped during this pandemic , and these front-line organizations have received the message that supporting them in fighting these heinous crimes is not a priority . What is the minister going to do to rectify this situation ? Hon. Bill Blair : As I said , we have developed a national strategy to combat human trafficking . We 've made $ 75 million in additional investments , and this new strategy takes a whole-of-government approach . It empowers victims and survivors to regain their self-confidence and control over their lives , and it will prevent more of these crimes from taking place . It provides better protection and support for those most vulnerable to human trafficking , and it will ensure that police and prosecutors have the resources to prosecute these traffickers for their heinous crimes . Mr . Chair , we 'll continue to work collaboratively with victims groups and to provide the supports that are required . Ms. Jag Sahota : Mr . Chair , more vulnerable Canadians continue to be let down . There are effective medications that have been developed for those living with cystic fibrosis , yet this medication is not available here . We know that the pharmaceutical company has not been able to apply to market this drug in Canada because of the changes to the PMPRB , which have been heavily criticized by stakeholders and patients . Will the minister delay the July 1 implementation date and review the regulations so that drugs like Trikafta are made available in Canada ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , there are two separate issues in that question , so I will talk about the PMPRB . As a government , we are committed , as you know , to increasing affordability of and accessibility to Canadian medications , to medications across Canada , and the PMPRB regulatory amendments will help Canadians to be able to afford their prescriptions . Canada will continue to be an important market for new medicines . In fact , many countries with much lower prices for medicine gain access to new medicines in the same time frame as Canada , or even faster . Ms. Jag Sahota : Mr . Chair , for those living with a rare disease , every single day can be a struggle . We know the importance of lowering drug costs , but not at the cost of life-saving drugs not being available here in Canada . Waiting years for the government to reduce regulations is not an option . We also know that the nature of the disease makes those people more susceptible to contracting COVID-19 , and they are at a higher risk of its being lethal . Why is this government continuing to let those with CF struggle and suffer needlessly ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : I believe the member opposite is talking about the drug Trikafta , and many cystic fibrosis patient groups have been advocating having access to it in Canada . In fact , the manufacturer of Trikafta has not submitted an application to market this product in Canada . However , that said , we do have a special access program for drugs that are not marketed in Canada . As of May 6 , Health Canada approved 95 applications for 98 patients to access Trikafta through the special access program . I would encourage all patients with cystic fibrosis to speak to their doctor to ensure that they too can apply through the special access program . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : You have time for one short question of 45 seconds . Ms. Jag Sahota : We know the importance of lowering drug costs . As you know , 4,300 people suffer from this rare genetic disease . Most of them are children and young adults . One young woman from Calgary is a CF champion , fighting for her passion to be a famous opera singer . She 's very talented . Her reality of living with CF has meant that she has had many visits to the hospital and had many health crises that have made singing impossible for a time . CF patients are waiting for this drug , which was fast-tracked in other countries . Now it seems that the changes to the PMPRB will cause further delays or complications . Will the minister delay the implementation and review the PMPRB ? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Honourable Minister , please provide a short response . Hon. Patty Hajdu : I will just repeat that the manufacturer has not applied to sell this drug in Canada . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Now we will go to Mr. Lobb of HuronBruce . Mr. Ben Lobb (HuronBruce, CPC) : Thank you very much . On July 25 , 2019 , after the federal-provincial-territorial agriculture meeting , the agriculture minister promised big changes in 2020 for programs like AgriStability and AgriRecovery . Besides a pilot program in a couple of provinces and an application deadline , is there anything else you would like to report ? Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : Yes , Mr.Chair . Since the July meeting in QuebecCity with the provincial and territorial ministers of agriculture , we 've been working to improve the AgriStability program . This issue remains a priority , and it 's included in my mandate letter . However , at this time , we 're responding to emergencies that go beyond what the various risk management programs can provide to our producers . Mr. Ben Lobb : You can appreciate , Minister , the issue we 're dealing with here . The United States Department of Agriculture has allocated $ 19 billion to farmers , $ 16 billion of that in direct support . The program that was offered last week , $ 252 million , was a mere fraction of what the United States is getting . If the minister is telling farmers to bank on the existing business risk management program , it 's not going to work . Countless numbers of pork farmers , just in my riding alone , have one thousand , two thousand , three thousand head of hogs ready to be shipped within the near future . They will lose $ 70 a head . AgriStability is n't going to cut it . We need an immediate program to help out these hard-working pork farmers . Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : I fully understand my colleague 's comments . That 's why we announced specific programs for the meat sector : $ 77.5million for processors , $ 50million for beef producers and $ 50million for pork producers . We 've also increased , improved and facilitated access to AgriStability . One pork producer tried the calculator and told me that he could quickly receive $ 11 per head of hog . Alberta 's agriculture minister even publicly stated that some producers could obtain the desired amount of $ 20 per head using the AgriStability program . Mr. Ben Lobb : Mr . Chair , you can see the problem right there with the math . The minister just said that one of her pork producers is going to get $ 11 . They are losing $ 70 . There 's a $ 59-per-head gap , times likely several thousand head of hogs in their barns . Let 's go to another trying issue with agriculture . It 's the carbon tax . I know that the government has their position on the carbon tax , and I know that I 'm not going to change it , but I want to give the members of Parliament across the way , the government , an idea of what a pork farmer might go through . A pork farmer sent me their bill for February 26 to March 24 . Their natural gas bill was about $ 2,400 . In there was close to $ 500 in federal carbon tax . Farmers manage their woodlots ethically . They have environmental farm plans . They have nutrient management plans . They get no credit for any of the carbon sequestration and ethical environmental management on their farm , yet every month they are asked to pay a carbon tax . It just does n't seem fair . I want the minister 's opinion on that . Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : As you know , our pollution pricing policy is designed to build a clean economy . We 've introduced exemptions for agriculture . On one hand , emissions from animal and vegetable production are not subject to carbon pricing , and on the other hand , farm fuels and other fuels delivered to off-farm points-of-sale are exempt . We 've also provided partial reimbursements for propane and natural gas used in commercial greenhouses . We have already done a lot . We encourage producers to take advantage of the business risk management programs , and we are ready to do more . We 've already shown that , and we will continue to do so . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : There is time for one short question and response . Go ahead , Mr. Lobb . Mr. Ben Lobb : Mr . Chair , I know the Minister of Agriculture has toured my riding . She knows very well what the lay of the land is here . What about pork farmers ? What about chicken farmers ? What about hens ? What about drying in the fall ? All those farmers pay a carbon tax , and there is no program for them . They pay and they pay and they pay , and what makes it worse is that they are given no credit for the environmental work they do on their farms . Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : It 's true that our producers work incredibly hard to protect the environment and ensure the well-being of their animals . That 's important , to be sure , but I 'd like to put the impact of pollution pricing into perspective . To put these estimates into context , AAFC used data from agricultural tax data programs to show the impact on a per-farm basis as a percentage of total operating costs . The estimates ranged from $ 210 to $ 819 per farm and 0.05 % to 0.42 % of total farm operating expenses . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We now move on to Mr.Lehoux . Mr. Richard Lehoux (Beauce, CPC) : Thank you , Mr.Chair . Being from a rural area , myself , I can assure you that people who live in rural communities are resourceful and resilient . Instead of staying cooped up in their homes , they are doing their best to retool and save the companies they work for . One of the only options they have is to work from home . Unfortunately , though , they do n't have access to the tools they need . Cellular and Internet networks are inadequate , even non-existent in some cases . I want to know , not whether the government is going to help these Canadians join the 21st century , but when . Can you give us any assurances and , above all , a timetable for a real plan ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : I agree with the member . The situation is very serious . High-speed Internet is not a luxury ; it 's a necessity . That 's why we launched the connect to innovate program . My fellow minister Ms. Monsef will be introducing the next strategy to improve the situation in all regions , especially rural areas . Finding a solution is absolutely imperative . Mr. Richard Lehoux : I do n't think the minister understood my question . In the 2019 budget , the government promised to connect all Canadians to the Internet by 2030 . This is 2020 . That 's 10years away . People do n't need reliable Internet service 10years down the road . The pandemic has made the need even more acute right now . When , then , will people have Internet access ? I 'm simply asking you for a date now . Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr.Chair , under the last budget , we launched a $ 1.7-billion program to support broadband infrastructure . That 's a lot of money for high-speed Internet . My fellow minister Ms.Monsef is in charge of the program . We also introduced the connect to innovate program , which has helped 900communities all over the country . We will keep working to make the lives of people who live in rural areas better , and we will find solutions to provide high-speed Internet access . Mr. Richard Lehoux : Mr.Chair , you no doubt know that Beauce is the cradle of small and medium-sized businesses . On March27 , the Prime Minister introduced the emergency wage subsidy to help businesses cope with the pandemic . Unfortunately , general partnerships were overlooked . Of the many constituents in my riding who have reached out to me on the subject , one , in particular , has contacted me three times since mid-April . I still do n't have anything to tell him because the government is dragging its feet . We 'd like to get a clear and specific answer . The same goes for sole proprietors , who were also overlooked . When is the government going to include these businesses in the current programs ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr.Chair , we announced in financial support for vulnerable small and medium-sized businesses that are not eligible for the measures already in place and that are struggling with cash flow issues . We 've also invested $ 71million to support businesses and organizations by giving them access to capital in rural communities . As well , we 've invested in programs for rural areas , and we will continue to make investments to help small and medium-sized businesses . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Mr.Lehoux , please keep it brief . Mr. Richard Lehoux : All right , Mr.Chair . The Canadian Federation of Agriculture asked the federal government for an agriculture and agri-food emergency fund of $ 2.6billion to help maintain food security in Canada in response to COVID-19 . Will the minister address the federation 's request ? Minister , I 'd like you to give us a date . Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau : We already have a host of business risk management programs , through which , $ 1.6billion is available to producers annually . More support is actually available , even through those programs , since they meet the demand . We are prepared to do more , and we will . I urge producers to apply for the AgriStability program and to use the funds in their AgriInvest accounts . Some $ 2.3billion is available through that program . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll now go to the honourable member for LangleyAldergrove , Mr. Van Popta . Mr. Tako Van Popta (LangleyAldergrove, CPC) : Mr . Chair , the government 's wage subsidy program is designed to help traditional companies , not high-growth companies . For example , I was talking to Ron , who operates an engineering firm in my riding that specializes in designing and building very expensive machines for their ever-expanding overseas markets . Business is down , but not by the requisite 30 % . Of course not , since they 're in high-growth mode , but just recently they had to lay off some very talented staff . Can the minister confirm that the wage subsidy program can be expanded or adapted to deal with high-growth companies that will play such a key role in Canada 's economic relaunch ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , my honourable colleague is absolutely correct . We , the government , take enormous pride in our small businesses , particularly the start-ups and the high-growth firms . They 're going to be absolutely essential for our economic recovery , and we know that some of them are ineligible for the wage subsidy . That is why we introduced a $ 250-million program in the industrial research assistance program through the National Research Council , strictly targeting and focusing on those high-growth firms that were ineligible for the wage subsidy , so that they can provide the wage support to keep those highly skilled individuals in Canada . Mr. Tako Van Popta : Mr . Chair , there is another category of businesses that are falling through the cracks and feel they are being left behind by the wage subsidy program . Those are recently merged companies . For example , there is a trucking company in my riding that is significantly bigger this year than it was last year as a result of some key acquisitions and mergers late last year . All of the legacy companies by themselves would qualify individually for the wage subsidy , but the merged company does not . Can the minister confirm that the wage subsidy program is sufficiently flexible to accommodate recently merged companies ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , again I want to thank my honourable colleague for his question . He is identifying unique pain points that exist within the overall economy with specific examples of companies that are not able to access some of the programming we have provided . I do want to highlight , when it comes to the wage subsidy , that we have made changes to the revenue thresholds to make more companies eligible . The specific example that the member opposite raises is something that is under consideration . Mr. Tako Van Popta : Mr . Chair , the government 's commercial rent assistance program discriminates against certain tenants based solely on whether their landlord has a mortgage on the subject building . I was talking to Leslie the other day . She manages a number of commercial office buildings in my riding . Some of these buildings have mortgages and some do n't , and it all depends on what they were able to negotiate with their banker . Leslie is having a very hard time explaining to her tenants why some will qualify for the rental subsidy and some wo n't , depending on which building they are in . Can the government confirm that the nonsensical mortgage requirement in the rent subsidy program is gone ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , the approach that was taken on trying to assist small businesses with rent is very much based on the fact that this is a provincial jurisdiction , so we have used the mortgage system as a way to do it . It is , in fact , not nonsensical . That said , we are looking at this particular issue . It 's something that is under consideration . We expect that we will find a way to ensure that those landlords who do n't have mortgages can work with the CMHC to have the appropriate approach to be eligible for this program . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : You have about one minute left , Mr. Van Popta . Go ahead with a short question . Mr. Tako Van Popta : Many people in my riding have reached out to me to say they are quite disturbed that their favourite hunting and sport shooting firearms are now on the banned list . Can the minister inform Canadians how many Canadian taxpayer dollars are going to go to the buyback program for legal gun owners and how far that money would go if it were to be diverted to something useful , such as more border controls to stop the illegal importation of firearms ? Hon. Bill Blair : Our first priority is the protection and safety of Canadians . We 've seen an unacceptable rise in gun violence right across our community . All weapons are being regulated in our country . Some , such as handguns , represent such a significant risk that we strongly restrict them . Some weapons , quite frankly , are completely unsuitable for any sporting or hunting activity , such as weapons designed for soldiers to engage in combat with other soldiers . We have now prohibited those weapons . The saving of lives is worth an investment in public safety . I want to assure the member we will bring forward legislation that will facilitate an appropriate buyback program . I look forward to a discussion in this House with the member opposite on how that can be done to ensure public safety and to ensure that we do it in as effective a way as possible . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll now go to Mr. Manly . Mr. Paul Manly : Thank you , Mr . Chair . I 'd like to thank the government and ministers present for the rapid relief that they 've provided to Canadians . I know the constituents in my riding really appreciate that . I 'd like to thank them also for being responsive to the MPs who have brought forward gaps in the program . The CERB requirements recognize dividend income for eligibility for the Canada emergency business account , CEBA , but the Canada emergency business account does not recognize dividends or contract payments . I 've been contacted by many small business owners who have been legally paying themselves with dividends for years , but these companies can not apply for the CEBA even though this might save them from bankruptcy during this crisis . Will the government make the necessary changes to allow dividend income to be admissible for CEBA eligibility ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : I 'd like to thank the honourable colleague for his very thoughtful question and his advocacy in looking for different solutions and in working with us to help small businesses , not only in his riding but across the country as well . He 's absolutely correct that the Canada emergency business account has been successful , as 590,000 loans have been issued . That 's a reflection of some of the changes that we introduced , which made the criteria more generous so that more businesses could obtain assistance . He has raised the issue of dividends . As I said before , we continue to work with Canadians and Canadian businesses and colleagues in this House to see how we can assist more Canadians , not less of them , and we 'll continue to endeavour to do that . Mr. Paul Manly : Mr . Chair , there are still many Canadians stranded overseas who are trying to return to Canada . Some have no assurance that their non-Canadian spouse will be allowed into Canada with them . Many are being forced to make an impossible choice between sheltering in place overseas or separating from their spouse in order to return home . Will the government remove unnecessary barriers and allow these Canadians to return to Canada immediately with their spouses ? Hon. Bill Blair : Mr . Chair , in an effort to flatten the curve and to protect Canadians , we 've taken a number of extraordinary measures at the border and we have restricted non-essential travel of people coming into Canada . While Canadian citizens and permanent residents will always be admissiblesubject , of course , to a 14-day quarantine upon entry foreign nationals are subject to travel restrictions . For individuals to be eligible to travel to Canada , their travel must be considered essential travel , consistent with the emergency order put in place . I recognize and very much respect the spirit of the member 's question . We recognize these are difficult situations . It is not our desire to keep families apart . I want to assure that each situation will be decided on a case-by-case basis based on the information made available to border service officers . I welcome any inquiries he may have . If he reaches out to my office , we 'll help in any way we can . Mr. Paul Manly : Mr . Chair , the Alberta energy regulator has suspended a wide range of environmental monitoring requirements for oil sands companies during this pandemic . This includes environmental reporting . It includes wetland wildlife and bird monitoring , even though Canada is a signatory to the international migratory bird treaty . Water that escapes from storm ponds does n't need to be tested . Air quality programs , including for first nations communities , have been reduced . Testing for leaks of methane , a powerful greenhouse gas , has been suspended . This is after the federal government has provided $ 750 million in funding for methane emission reductions . The federal government has also just committed $ 1.7 billion to clean up orphaned oil wells . That message , clearly , is about the negligence of the Alberta government . It is something corporations should be paying for . Will the federal government hold the Alberta government to account and withhold energy sector relief funding until these environmental regulations are reinstated ? Hon. Chrystia Freeland : Mr . Chair , I 'd like to thank the member for his question and for his very collaborative approach with our government on a number of issues . I would like to thank him for this particular question and his particular reference to methane , because it gives me an opportunity to highlight some very important progress that the federal government made this week in working with the Province of Alberta . Just yesterday Alberta joined B.C . and Saskatchewan and published its own draft regulations on methane . This will allow us , in working with Alberta , to work on equivalency on methane , which will allow us to work towards standing down the federal system in those jurisdictions . This is tremendously important , because it will allow us to cut methane emissions by 45 % by 2025 . It 's hugely important for fighting climate change together . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Now we 'll go to the honourable member for Hamilton Mountain , Mr. Duvall . Mr. Scott Duvall (Hamilton Mountain, NDP) : Mr . Chair , I was pleased to hear about extending the tax deadline to October 1 in yesterday 's announcement for seniors . After many discussions with the Minister of Seniors , I was glad to hear that she was listening to the NDP and many others on making this happen . It stops a lot of interruptions for people who could n't get their taxes done . Mr . Chair , COVID-19 has been showing us in stark terms that Canadian seniors are struggling to make ends meet in Canada . Before enduring the crisis , it was clear that OAS and GIS benefits levels were just not enough for seniors to keep up with the cost of living , so we need to fix this now . Why is the government refusing to increase OAS and GIS benefits to lift seniors out of poverty on a permanent basis ? Hon. Deb Schulte (Minister of Seniors) : Mr . Chair , I want to thank my honourable colleague for giving me this opportunity to rise today and talk about how we are supporting Canadian seniors during this pandemic . Many Canadian seniors are facing significant health , economic and social challenges as a result of the pandemic . They built this country and now they need our help . Our government is taking significant action to provide Canadian seniors with greater financial security and give them the help they need during this crisis . We 're building on past measures by introducing a one-time tax-free payment of $ 300 for those who receive OAS and of $ 200 for those receiving GIS , totalling $ 500 to seniors who receive both . We are also supporting community-based projects to improve the quality of life for seniors through the New Horizons for Seniors program , and investing in other charities . Seniors need our help , and we are delivering for them . Mr. Scott Duvall : Mr . Chair , I was glad to hear that the Minister of Seniors is acknowledging the financial burden that our seniors are taking on . She mentioned the prescription dispensing fees , the added costs of their groceries and the delivery charges . I was glad that the Prime Minister acknowledged the heavy toll seniors are facing , and that they helped to shape this country and now they need our help . A surprising statement that I heard yesterday was the Treasury Board and the seniors minister 's admission in their press briefing that the level of assistance being provided to Canadian seniors is quite low . Why is the seniors minister acknowledging all the burdens they 're trying to help the seniors with , but the response they 're giving is just a very low way of handling it ? Hon. Deb Schulte : I really do want to acknowledge my honourable colleague for his advocacy . I just want to assure him that while the government remains committed to implementing policies in our platform , we are focused on this health crisis right now . We have provided financial support to seniors sooner through the GST credit top-up , and now with additional payments to OAS and GIS recipients . This year we are investing over twice as much on financial assistance for seniors as we committed to in our platform , which is $ 3.8 billion compared to $ 1.56 billion in the platform . Seniors need our help and we 're delivering . These payments have provided greater support for the most vulnerable seniors . Just to give some details , for those on OAS and GIS , they will get , in conjunction with the GST credit top-up , $ 875 per adult , and over $ 1,500 per couple . This is not an insignificant amount . This is a significant amount to support our seniors during this pandemic . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : You have about one minute left for both a question and a response . Go ahead , Mr. Duvall . Mr. Scott Duvall : Thank you , Mr . Chair . The minister was talking about there being a maximum payment , if it 's possible . What I 've heard from seniors is this is a one-shot deal and it 's an insult to them . They want some stability on an ongoing basis . We did make an agreement about two weeks ago that help would be implemented without delay on the seniors issue and for people with disabilities . Why did yesterday 's announcement include only the people who are seniors , but not people with disabilities ? Why have they been omitted ? When can they expect help to come ? Hon. Deb Schulte : I just want to touch on the two points raised . On the one-time payment , we know that seniors need help now , and that 's why it 's important to get that money into seniors ' accounts as soon as possible . That is why we 're providing the one payment right away , instead of small amounts spread over months . In the coming weeks we will look at additional supports for other vulnerable Canadians . I just want to let him know we are working on additional measures . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll go now Mr. Scott Duvall : I did n't hear anything about the disability The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : The five minutes are finished . It is now over to Mrs.Gill , the member for Manicouagan . Mrs. Marilne Gill : Thank you , Mr.Chair . I 'll be sharing my time with the member for Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLesBasques . I have just one question . It 's for the government , and this will be the fourth time I 've asked today . When I go back home , what am I going to tell the people of Chandler , Amqui , Bic , Saint-Simon , Tadoussac and Harrington Harbour ? Am I going to tell them that the government supports the Bloc Qubcois 's proposal ? We propose giving seasonal workers access to employment insurance benefits until next season , regardless of whether they received the CERB , how many hours they worked or how many they accumulated . Should I instead tell them that the Liberal government has nothing in store for them as they suffer through the crisis ? The government has n't managed to bridge the employment insurance gap , and is even planning to bring it to six , if not eight , months . That means they 'll have nothing to put on the dinner table for the next year . I 'd like an answer , Mr.Chair . Hon. Jean-Yves Duclos : Mr.Chair , I have three things to say in response to the member 's important question . First , we obviously understand what she 's saying . The work is seasonal , not the workers . The work they do is fundamental so they can support their families and their communities in eastern Quebec and other regions . Second , the CERB delivers significant assistance to those often vulnerable workers , the majority of whom would be able or certainly eager to find another job . Third , and finally , before any longer-term investments are made , it 's important to keep in mind that those who may have received employment insurance benefits but who lost them in recent weeks or who do seasonal work are eligible for the CERB . That said , we are also looking ahead . We 've already announced some very important measuresand we 'll continue to do soin support of tourism , culture , agriculture , fisheries , forestry and many other key contributors to regional development in Quebec and elsewhere . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : The member for Rimouski-NeigetteTmiscouataLesBasques , Mr.Blanchette-Joncas , has the floor . Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas : Mr.Chair , the situation my fellow member just described is of little comfort to those in Quebec 's regions . To be frank , the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance program is a flop . According to the Canadian Federation of Independent Business , one in three businesses does n't qualify for rent relief because it does n't meet the 70 % drop in revenues requirement . Half of businesses have indicated that their landlords wo n't be applying for the program because it 's optional . Commercial landlords can choose to participate in the program or not . How is that going to help businesses , Mr.Chair ? We are still trying to figure that out . Businesses , especially seasonal ones , need more support to cover their fixed costs . Will the government commit to reviewing the program , which is too restrictive for businesses and optional for landlords ? The program must do more to help businesses , particularly seasonal ones , cover their fixed costs . Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we know that businesses are , of course , very concerned about fixed costs . Our rent relief program is very significant . We have n't yet announced all the details , so it 's much too soon to say that it 's flawed . More information will be available in the next few days . At that point , we hope to be on the right track when it comes to fixed costs and rent . Mr. Maxime Blanchette-Joncas : I hope you 're making adjustments . It 's totally unacceptable that only 10 % of businesses who need the relief can get it . What 's more , the public health crisis has brought its share of change for businesses , particularly with the new health measures . They have to plan , implement preventative measures , have response plans , train staff and acquire the necessary equipment . In order to do those things , protect the public and reopen their doors , businesses have to assume the costs . Will the government commit to providing financial assistance to businesses , especially those in the tourism industry , so they can cover the costs of putting the new health measures in place ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : I know the situation is very serious in rural communities . That 's why we 've invested $ 71million in community futures development corporations , or CFDCs , and business development centres . Both of those will go a long way towards helping businesses in rural communities , and I have no doubt that we will continue working together to find other solutions . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Now we 'll move on to the honourable member for Calgary Centre , Mr. McLean . Mr. Greg McLean (Calgary Centre, CPC) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . One of the terms for accessing the Canada emergency commercial rent assistance , CECRA , is that you must have a mortgage on the property . One of the key terms of eligibility for this support is that the landlord owes money to a bank . Will the Minister of Finance tell us if this program was designed for the benefit of landlords and tenants or for the benefit of banks ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , I appreciate the question from the member opposite . I think that it 's important to know that commercial rent and landlord-tenant relationships are provincial jurisdictions . Therefore , as we embarked on an approach that could enable landlords and tenants to get to an agreement that would help both , we used the CMHC as a vehicle from which we could do that . We think that we 've come up with a program that provides advantages for the landlords and advantages for the tenants , and we will be announcing details that will include how mortgages can be put in place for those landlords who do n't currently have them . Mr. Greg McLean : Brookfield Properties , a large Canadian firm , announced that its rent collections on commercial properties for April were 15 % of the lease terms . Luckily , Brookfield has another company , Brookfield Business Partners , poised to help by buying up the distressed equity of the firms that owe them money . Did the Minister of Finance design CECRA with this outcome in mind , washing out individual investors and small companies and transferring that value into the hands of vulture financiers who hold all the cards ? Hon. Bill Morneau : In fact , Mr . Chair , we designed this program exactly with the idea in mind of the challenge that we 're seeing . We 're seeing that in many cases commercial tenants are not actually able to pay their rent , so landlords are not getting the rent that 's due . Therefore , there 's a mutual interest from tenants and from landlords in coming to an agreement . By providing funding through the mortgage system to those landlords , we recognize that we 'll enable both of those two parts of the equation to come to an agreement that we think will be advantageous for the sector over the long term . Mr. Greg McLean : In the past two months , the Bank of Canada has tripled the size of its balance sheet to almost $ 400 billion , with more to come , Mr . Chair . In the 2008 recession , the world 's major economies endured quantitative easing on a previously unknown scale , most of which has not since been unwound . Canada endured a then-record $ 50-billion deficit , but we did not need to enter the uncertain world of QE , quantitative easing , as a result of the strength of Canada 's oil and gas industry . Will the minister acknowledge that this government 's oil and gas policy mismanagement has led to economic decline , necessitating hundreds of billions of dollars of quantitative easing ? Hon. Chrystia Freeland : Mr . Chair , let me challenge one assumption implicit in the honourable member 's question , the assumption that our government fails to understand the importance of the oil and gas sector to our economy . Let me quote some leaders from Alberta and their response to the lease program . Tim McMillan , CEO of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers , said , I think this is essential . Not all companies are going to need to tap into this sort of liquidity ... but some that are normally high-quality , stable companies likely will be looking for this program to provide a certain amount of liquidity for them . CAPP understands that we are supporting Canadian companies , including in the oil and gas sector , and I would urge the members opposite to understand that as well . Mr. Greg McLean : BlackRock is one of the world 's largest investment companies , managing trillions of dollars of bonds . It has lobbied regulators around the world to not be named a systemically important financial institution . The Bank of Canada unexpectedly engaged BlackRock as an adviser on its bond-buying plans . Is the Minister of Finance mindful of the conflict of interest that exists between the world 's largest bond manager , BlackRock , and the advice it 's giving the Bank of Canada on buying bonds ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , the member opposite might know that the Bank of Canada is independent from the government , and as such we are not privy to those decisions and support the continuing independence of the Bank of Canada from the government . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Mr. McLean , you may have just a short question . Mr. Greg McLean : The finance sector seems to be getting well served during this economic crisis . Will the minister endeavour to provide a more balanced program of benefits going forward for the sake of the entire Canadian economy , and not just the Brookfields , the BlackRocks and the big banks ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , I think the notion that one sector is being advantaged versus another actually defies the facts . More than 550,000 loans have gone out to small businesses in the form of $ 40,000 loans per business over a very short time period . Canada is a leader in this regard , and we 'll continue to support businesses all across Canada with loans and support as they need it to get ourselves through this difficult time . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll go to the last five-minute round . We 'll begin with the honourable member for Carleton , Mr. Poilievre . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : Thank you , Mr . Chair . What is the dollar value of the total assets of the Government of Canada ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , earlier today we were given incorrect information on the Auditor General . I would like to be able to provide more information at my next response . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , the member for Carleton said that the previous government spent more on the Auditor General than the current government , and that is actually incorrect . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : What is the total dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , in fact , in the last full year of the Harper government , in 2014-15 , the total spending on the Auditor General was $ 85.8 million . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : What is the dollar value of the assets of the Government of Canada ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , in the most recent year , 2018-19 , the total spend was $ 92.4 million for the Auditor General , showing a 7.7 % increase . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , I would just say it 's shocking when people bring forward incorrect information to the House to try to make a point . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : What are the total liabilities of the Government of Canada ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , we will continue to support Canadians through this time , with support not only for businesses but for individuals to get through and get a bridge to a better time . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : What is just the dollar value ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , that 's a continuing commitment . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : I know we should n't ask the minister about numbers . He 's just the finance minister , after all , but what is the equity on the Government of Canada 's balance sheet ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , I would advise the member for Carleton to memorize those Auditor General figures for his next foray into the House of Commons . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : The minister has claimed that our balance sheet is strong . There are three components to a balance sheet : the assets , the liabilities , and the equity . The minister does n't know any of the three , so clearly he does n't actually know anything about our balance sheet . That 's reassuring . According to the Auditor General , the negative net worth of our Government of Canada will be as much as $ 1 trillion by the end of this fiscal year . Can the minister , if he is familiar with any of these numbers , tell us if it is possible that his government will hit $ 1 trillion of debt this year ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , I want to assure Canadians that our approach will be to continue to make investments on their behalf . That is available to us because of our strong fiscal position , but we will continue to take that approach , which we think is the appropriate one . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : Will it be $ 1 trillion , yes or no ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , as I said , we will continue to focus on the importance of supporting Canadians . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : What is the size of our current national debt ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , I think what will happen as we do that is that we will allow ourselves to have a stronger economy at the end because of these investments . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : What is the size of the national debt ? Hon. Bill Morneau : We have always seen , Mr . Chair , that these investments are not only supporting Canadians ; they are supporting businesses so that we do have a strong economy and a strong fiscal position coming out of this . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : Does the finance minister know the size of our national debt ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , I will continue to focus our efforts , as we believe we should , on supporting Canadians through this time . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : Does the finance minister know what $ 1 trillion is ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , we are continuing to make investments that we believe are prudent in the face of this economic challenge , supporting Canadians as we know we need to . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : What is the total dollar value of all the public and private debt in Canada ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , we know that by supporting Canadians , by continuing to make investments , we will enable Canadiens to have less debt themselves because that The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Mr. Poilievre . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : What is the total debt , public and private , as a share of GDP in Canada ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , the important consideration here is that the federal government is taking a position that we should support Canadians so that they do n't take on the debt themselves . Hon. Pierre Poilievre : Yet they have . They have record household debt , record corporate debt and growing government debt . The finance minister does n't seem to know any of the basic numbers that would be required to govern the finances of the Government of Canada , so I will give him one last chance . Based on his latest briefings , what is the total size of Canada 's national debt ? If he does n't know , can he have the humility and honesty just to say so ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , I want to thank the member for slightly more time in this response to say that we think the best thing to do during this time period is to invest in Canadians . We know that in that way they will not be supporting as much debt themselves . The government is in a fiscal position that enables us to take on debt at this time , which we think is appropriate to get our economy to a better position at the end of this crisis . We think that 's appropriate . We will continue to take that approach . Some hon . members : Hear , hear ! The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : The hon . government House leader is rising on a point of order . Hon. Pablo Rodriguez : I have a point of order , Mr.Chair . I think we need to keep the interpreters in mind and the work they are doing , particularly when it comes to the flow and speed of questions . As the interpreters have already mentioned , they 've suffered more injuries during this short time than during all of last year . Mr.Chair , I kindly ask that you make sure members take that into account . Thank you . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : I 'm not sure whether that constitutes a point of order , but it 's certainly an important reminder for members of the House to respect interpreters ' working conditions . Please note that this is the end of our questions to ministers for this afternoon . Honourable members , please note too that pursuant to an order made on April 20 , the House has been recalled . As such , the committee will now adjourn and the House sitting will begin shortly thereafter . The bells will be rung to call in members , and a parade will begin the sitting . This committee is now adjourned . 
Query : What did the Prime Minister say about fraud in distribution of funds ? The Chair : Seeing no further petitions to be presented , we 'll continue , and we will now proceed to the questioning of ministers . Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes to allow employees who provide support for the sitting to replace each other safely . Go ahead , Mr. Scheer . Hon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition) : It was revealed yesterday that this government 's policy was to ignore fraud . The Prime Minister 's reaction was to act as if everything was normal . In fact , we 've learned that over 200,000cases of suspected fraud have been identified in the benefit applications . The Prime Minister is failing our future generations . Our children and grandchildren are going to pay back billions of dollars that he 's borrowing to pay tax cheats . Will the Prime Minister protect taxpayers and immediately begin a review of these 200,000cases of suspected fraud ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister) : Our priority was to get money out quickly to all Canadians who needed it , and that 's exactly what we 've done . Millions of Canadians have received the money they so desperately needed . Having said that , I want to make it very clear , Mr.Chair : Fraud is unacceptable . We have measures in place to detect fraud . All fraudsters will be required to pay back the money they fraudulently received from the government . We 're going to make sure that this is done in the coming months . Hon. Andrew Scheer : Mr . Chair , Conservatives agree that those who need help should get it , and no one is arguing that they should n't , but reports indicate that the Liberals have ordered public servants to turn a blind eye to 200,000 cases of suspected fraud . It 's a simple question : Yes or no , did the government instruct any government department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , the priority in this situation was getting money out to the millions of Canadians who needed it as quickly as possible , but of course fraud is unacceptable . That 's why we have put safeguards in place to ensure that anyone who received that money fraudulently will have to repay it . Hon. Andrew Scheer : It 's a yes-or-no question , Mr . Chair . Did the government give any kind of instruction to public servants in any department to ignore red flags or warnings of fraudulent cases , yes or no ? 
Query : What did the Minister of Seniors say about pandemic assistance for seniors ? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Now we 'll go to the honourable member for Hamilton Mountain , Mr. Duvall . Mr. Scott Duvall (Hamilton Mountain, NDP) : Mr . Chair , I was pleased to hear about extending the tax deadline to October 1 in yesterday 's announcement for seniors . After many discussions with the Minister of Seniors , I was glad to hear that she was listening to the NDP and many others on making this happen . It stops a lot of interruptions for people who could n't get their taxes done . Mr . Chair , COVID-19 has been showing us in stark terms that Canadian seniors are struggling to make ends meet in Canada . Before enduring the crisis , it was clear that OAS and GIS benefits levels were just not enough for seniors to keep up with the cost of living , so we need to fix this now . Why is the government refusing to increase OAS and GIS benefits to lift seniors out of poverty on a permanent basis ? Hon. Deb Schulte (Minister of Seniors) : Mr . Chair , I want to thank my honourable colleague for giving me this opportunity to rise today and talk about how we are supporting Canadian seniors during this pandemic . Many Canadian seniors are facing significant health , economic and social challenges as a result of the pandemic . They built this country and now they need our help . Our government is taking significant action to provide Canadian seniors with greater financial security and give them the help they need during this crisis . We 're building on past measures by introducing a one-time tax-free payment of $ 300 for those who receive OAS and of $ 200 for those receiving GIS , totalling $ 500 to seniors who receive both . We are also supporting community-based projects to improve the quality of life for seniors through the New Horizons for Seniors program , and investing in other charities . Seniors need our help , and we are delivering for them . Mr. Scott Duvall : Mr . Chair , I was glad to hear that the Minister of Seniors is acknowledging the financial burden that our seniors are taking on . She mentioned the prescription dispensing fees , the added costs of their groceries and the delivery charges . I was glad that the Prime Minister acknowledged the heavy toll seniors are facing , and that they helped to shape this country and now they need our help . A surprising statement that I heard yesterday was the Treasury Board and the seniors minister 's admission in their press briefing that the level of assistance being provided to Canadian seniors is quite low . Why is the seniors minister acknowledging all the burdens they 're trying to help the seniors with , but the response they 're giving is just a very low way of handling it ? 
Query : What did the Prime Minister say about students ? The Chair : Mr.Blanchet now has the floor . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet (BeloeilChambly, BQ) : Thank you very much , Mr.Chair . On Friday , students in Quebec and Canada will be able to apply for the Canada emergency student benefit , which is a good thing . This program was necessary , particularly because the number of students who wo n't be able to get back their jobs from last year is much higher than the number of jobs that might be available to these young people . There are also issues of duration . We do n't know how long these jobs will remain unavailable . People talked about a risk to being in the labour market and meeting the needs of the labour market . On April29 , the Deputy Prime Minister made a formal commitment to ensure that these programs are accompanied by work incentives for youth and all CESB recipients . So that everyone knows what they 're getting into , I 'd like to know whether the employment incentives that will accompany the Canada emergency response benefit will be known by Friday . Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : I thank the hon . member for understanding the importance of supporting students who , for the most part , wo n't be able to get the summer jobs they were counting on . Young people do n't just want to earn money ; they also want to gain work experience . That 's why we 're setting up programs , including Canada summer jobs , but also another program with 76,000new jobs for young people in important sectors , so that young people can also get jobs . We will continue to work with youth and employers to ensure that gaps in the labour market are addressed , while ensuring that youth are well-supported . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : That 's very interesting , but it does n't answer my question at all . People in the fishing , tourism and agricultural sectors , as well as municipalities and , from the very beginning , of course , the Government of Quebec , more generally , have expressed fears that job gains will cause people to lose their benefits and discourage them from going to work . The only way to avoid that is to ensure that people keep more money as they work more . That is the principle . In fact , we propose that over the $ 1,000no-penalty limit , half of the earnings be exempt from penalty . Is this something that could be considered ? Since it 's been two weeks since the commitment was made and it 's urgent , can we act now ? The emergency should n't last eight months . Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , young people need money , but they also need work experience . This is an unprecedented situation , which is why we 're working with seasonal industries and the different regions to make sure they have a sufficient workforce in their situation . Students can be part of it , but at the same time we must provide the necessary support for those who ca n't find a job . That 's why we continue to work with the industries involved to ensure that they have a sufficient workforce while we support students . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Unfortunately , the spirit of it does n't seem to have been understood . I doubt that , even in the best-case scenario , the government will be able to get all the jobs needed in a timely manner for all these young people to decide to go ahead . So , first of all , there will be a shortage of jobs . Second , people are n't crazy . If they earn less by working than they earn by not working , all the good faith in the world wo n't solve the problem . Can we make sure that people keep more money in their pockets as they work more ? I think we can have a clear answer , given the timeframe . People are going to start registering for the program on Friday . The principles are good , but a clear answer would be good too . 
Query : What did Bains say about business loans ? Mrs. Tracy Gray : Mr . Chair , an ongoing concern I 've heard from small business owners is that they are ineligible for CEBA because they do n't have a business account . When I brought up this point to small business minister Ng at committee , she said it was the first time that she had heard of this issue and that she would follow up . I asked this question on April 23 , and it 's now been almost three weeks . Small business has been let down . Can the government confirm that they 're going to fix this issue ? Hon. Navdeep Bains (MississaugaMalton, Lib.) : Chair , I 'd like to thank the honourable member for her question . It is really important that this program that we 've established help small businesses . We have shown in the past that we 're very flexible and nimble in accommodating the needs of businesses . I assure the member opposite that we are looking into this matter and will come forward with a resolution in a timely manner . Mrs. Tracy Gray : Mr . Chair , I just read another email from a small business owner this morning who has been let down by the government . He chose to pay off debts instead of paying himself a wage ; therefore , he 's ineligible for CEBA , for that loan . Owner-operators have been eliminated from participating in government programs because they did not put themselves on the payroll . This shows a true lack of understanding of small businesses and especially of owner-operators . Will the government commit to fixing this issue ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Thank you very much . Again , I want to thank the honourable member for her question . We have focused particularly on small businesses to make sure they have the appropriate support they need . With regard to the program that she highlighted , we have shown flexibility in the eligibility criteria by decreasing the payroll threshold for individual companies that want to apply for this loan to $ 20,000 versus $ 50,000 , and the upper limit has gone to $ 1.5 million versus $ 1 million . We will continue to bring forward the changes necessary to have more businesses Mrs. Tracy Gray : This government has left Canadian craft breweries out to dry , like the hops in their beer . On April 24 , the Canadian Craft Brewers Association released a report on the effects of COVID-19 on the Canadian craft brewing industry . The report states that 38 % of craft brewers did not qualify for the Canadian emergency wage subsidy in March , and 53 % were either not sure or predicted that they would not qualify in April . Many a brew pub , like BNA in my riding , due to higher payrolls are also not eligible for the CEBA loan . They have been left out and let down . Five per cent of these breweries have already closed permanently , and others are on the verge of doing so . A portion have stepped up and are making PPE . Will this government take the initiative to support this industry by amending program requirements ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : When it comes to the Canada emergency wage subsidy , we have demonstrated flexibility and nimbleness . The program requirement changed in terms of revenue threshold . We originally had 30 % for the month of March . We changed that to 15 % . The eligibility criteria to compare to the first two months of this year now also compare to the previous year as well . We 're going to continue to make changes to make sure more businesses can access this program . The Chair : Ms. Gray , you have 33 seconds . Mrs. Tracy Gray : In my constituency , Okanagan fruit production is a huge industry , and many apple orchardists have brought concerns to me regarding high costs , apples from last season selling below cost , the CUSMA agreement not helping the industy , and low-priced Washington apples flooding our market . COVID-19 has exacerbated their dire financial situation . The BC Fruit Growers ' Association has called the government announcements of measures for agriculture underwhelming . I questioned Minister Bibeau in the House a couple of months ago , and at the time she did not have an answer . What is the plan to help our orchardists ? The Chair : The honourable minister . Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau (ComptonStanstead, Lib.) : Thank you , Mr.Chair . Since this crisis began , we have been helping entrepreneurs in all sectors . We began with measures to assist small , medium and large companies , and we are now going progressively sector by sector . Last week , we announced additional funding for agriculture The Chair : We 'll now go on to Mr. Barlow . Mr. John Barlow (Foothills, CPC) : Mr . Chair , in my riding of Foothills , we 've established a Foothills business recovery task force . We surveyed hundreds of small business owners about the effectiveness of the emergency programs put forward by the government . The results of that survey were quite alarming . More than half of the respondents have not qualified for any of the programs , and the vast majority of them have said their businesses will not last more than another month . Will the government expand the eligibility for some of these programs to include sole proprietorships , or is the government still looking at refunding the GST paid by some of the businesses over the last year ? 
Query : What did Morneau say about the debt ? Mr. Pat Kelly : Yesterday the Parliamentary Budget Officer said that Canada 's debt could reach $ 1 trillion this year . What will it cost to service a $ 1-trillion debt ? Hon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance) : Mr. Speaker , we remain committed to doing , as we 've said , whatever it takes to support Canadians through this challenging time . We think this is extremely important , and we will continue to focus on the well-being of all Canadians . Mr. Pat Kelly : What is the estimated annual debt servicing cost of the aid measures announced so far ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr . Chair , there will be an opportunity for us to give a full outline of the costs and benefits of our measures , and we will do that when we have the ability to have The Chair : Mr. Kelly . Mr. Pat Kelly : is Canada 's AAA credit rating . 
Query : What did Bains say about the threshold for the wage subsidy program and loan refinancing ? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton (Simcoe North, CPC)) : The honourable Minister of Industry . Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , I 'd like to thank the honourable member for his question . I want to highlight the fact that we did make an amendment . When we originally proposed this initiative , the threshold was 30 % for the month of March . Now businesses will only need to show a 15 % decline in revenue , and businesses will have the option of using January and February as a reference period to show revenue losses , or of using the same time last year . This reflects , again , our ability to understand the needs of businesses , to act quickly and to make sure that they benefit from this very important initiative . Mr. Larry Maguire : They still do n't qualify , Mr . Chair . The Blarney Stone restaurant in Killarney has repeatedly asked the Minister of Finance if they could refinance their loans through the Canada small business financing program . Will the Minister of Finance give small business owners the ability to refinance their existing loans through the program , yes or no ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , again , we 've demonstrated flexibility and nimbleness when it comes to these financing options . I 'd also like to highlight another very important initiative that was mentioned earlier , the deferring of GST/HST and customs duty payments for businesses for the next three months . This will help 3.2 million business owners and entrepreneurs across the country . Again , it 's another initiative to put more money in the pockets of businesses as they deal with this unprecedented health care crisis . Mr. Larry Maguire : Mr . Chair , the Liberals still have n't fixed the payroll eligibility problems for many small business owners who need to access the zero-interest loans available in CEBA . Can the minister provide any rationale for why countless small businesses are not being allowed to access these loans ? 
Query : What did Bains say about the arts , culture , and tourism industry ? Mr. John Nater : Mr . Chair , the arts and culture industry has a massive impact on local economies . In my riding alone we have the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum , the Stratford Festival , Drayton Entertainment and Stratford Summer Music . The postponement and cancellation of the seasons of these important cultural institutions is having a massive impact on the hospitality industry , including local restaurants , hotels and bed and breakfasts . Many of these businesses are small businesses and owner-operated businesses that are falling through the cracks in the government 's programs that have been introduced . How will the government address the blind spot in their programs for small businesses in communities like this , which rely on the tourism and the arts and culture industries ? Hon. Navdeep Bains : Mr . Chair , clearly , we understand how important these organizations are to these communities . That is why we allocated $ 500 million to respond to the specific financial needs of arts , heritage and sports organizations , to help them be more resilient through this difficult time . Last week we rolled out the funding of this announcement , and we look forward to engaging with communities across the country . Mr. John Nater : Mr . Chair , 1.8 million jobs are attributed to the tourism industry in Canada . Among these , 740,000 are related to international travelling . No one wants to see the borders reopen until it 's safe to do so , but can the government provide clarity on what criteria will be used to provide some information to these tourism operators of how , when and under what criteria international borders will be reopened ? 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Project Manager : All set ? Okay . Cool . Right . So um basically I 'm just gon na go over real quickly um some news I 've just got from the board on how we 're supposed to do with this um { vocalsound } remote control . And then I 'm gon na turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you 've found and then we 'll have a bit of discussion . So basically uh what I 've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no { disfmarker } we 're not doing D_V_D_ , we 're not doing anything else , Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : it 's just gon na be a television remote . { vocalsound } Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um so that 's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it 's , we put fashion in electronics . Um and no teletext . I 'm not sure what teletext is but I 'm assuming you guys do , so we do n't wan na include that um in this particular design . { vocalsound } For reasons that I do n't really know . There 's { disfmarker } but it 's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we 'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it 's television only we 'll be able to change our uh { vocalsound } um well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . { vocalsound } Anyway . So I 'm gon na turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ? Project Manager : Oh , right yeah . Marketing : Got ta plug you in . Project Manager : Yep . Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it 's gon na come up . Yep . Cool . Industrial Designer : Okay . Right . That 's page one of my presentation . Project Manager : Brilliant . Marketing : Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it 's lovely . Industrial Designer : So the uh method . We 're gon na have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there 's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there 's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that 's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there 's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that 'd be really bad . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } 'Kay . Industrial Designer : Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it 's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was { disfmarker } since we ca n't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : The chip , um , silicon based chip I do n't really see any way around that , we ca n't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I 'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that 's a word I made up , I do n't really know what it means . Project Manager : 'Kay . Fair enough . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range . Project Manager : 'Kay . Industrial Designer : Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it 'll only be T_V_s . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply ca n't afford this kinds of lawsuits Marketing : Fine . Industrial Designer : which adm admittedly is gon na come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics Industrial Designer : 'cause we were thinking { disfmarker } Project Manager : that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white { disfmarker } like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice , Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : It needs , yeah . Project Manager : you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ? Industrial Designer : Yeah that should n't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that 's perfectly possible for us to do . Project Manager : Okay , okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } That 's the end of my presentation . Marketing : Cool . Project Manager : Great . Thank you very much Nathan . { vocalsound } Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that 'd be great as well . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : S plug yourself in here . Mm . { vocalsound } Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down { disfmarker } Mm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Looks like you 're in okay . Industrial Designer : Is it plugged in well ? There it goes . Computer adjusting . User Interface : Th Project Manager : There you go . Sweet . Marketing : There you go . User Interface : Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that 's no problem . Project Manager : Yeah sorry I could n't get that g to use before . User Interface : Um so some of my findings . Um basically wan na send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we 're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does . Um { vocalsound } now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we ca n't quite see my red there very well Project Manager : Oh yeah look at that . Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } User Interface : but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : and most users will find it uh find that they wo n't use most of the functions because they do n't know how to use them and do n't wan na take the time to learn how to do it . As you also notice it 's quite a boring design . Um . Another remote control , slightly different , it 's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it 's also quite boring . So Project Manager : { vocalsound } Nice . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : my personal preferences . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . And I was gon na add another uh slide here but I did n't quite have time there . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . User Interface : Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it 's uh { gap } . Project Manager : Great . Thanks for that Ron . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : { vocalsound } 'Kay Marketing : Does that mean I 'm up ? Project Manager : yep that 's you . Marketing : I think so . Okay . User Interface : I can plug you in . Marketing : Oh that would be perfect . Thank you . Slide show up and running . Project Manager : Give it a little bit . Marketing : Or not . Uh . Oh there we go . Perfect . Okay . So this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we 've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort { disfmarker } like watching a hundred people { vocalsound } use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they 're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they do n't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody 's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that 's all that 's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they 're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public 's use , they 're not using a lot of it , they do n't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they do n't know what to do with . { vocalsound } And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their { disfmarker } the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they ca n't find it in the room . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . { vocalsound } Um there 's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : and pretty much they all think they 're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I do n't know if that 's something we 're ready to look into technically , that 's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic 's obviously the one that 's gon na keep growing , so if that 's the direction we 're headed in it 's something to think about . Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards . { vocalsound } So it 's a good start for us . Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 's great . Thank you Sarah . Right . So um Marketing : Need to unplug this ? Project Manager : yep I 'll just uh switch that back here . Marketing : Need it back . Project Manager : I 'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase . Marketing : There you go . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Right so I think we 've covered most of these important questions through this um { vocalsound } through you guys 's presentations um { vocalsound } we 've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . { vocalsound } Um Sarah , she 's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , Marketing : Oh right . Project Manager : { vocalsound } um so do we wan na go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is { vocalsound } um { vocalsound } we 've got w if we 're gon na go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics { vocalsound } um . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } We 're not catering to the pensioners of the world I do n't think so . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes . So maybe this { disfmarker } we should look into this younger demographic . Um . So Marketing : Right . Project Manager : { vocalsound } uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we 're constrained to plastics very well , we 've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it 's looking um , Marketing : Right . Project Manager : which might be easier given that we 're going for simpler function and that we 're only going for a telly . Marketing : Uh . Project Manager : Um so um . How { disfmarker } th this voice operation thing is { disfmarker } I think is a good idea um assuming that it 's doable , um at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see . Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Okay you ca n't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : but we might be able to say um { vocalsound } volume up . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Oh . That could work . I like that . Industrial Designer : With a simple command like locate . And then it could start to beep Marketing : Yeah . Something very basic . Industrial Designer : and Marketing : Right . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Right . Industrial Designer : therefore be found . User Interface : Sounds good . Marketing : Is that only gon na be within our two hundred foot range then ? Industrial Designer : Oh yeah I think that 's very doable . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you could n't speak into the remote that you 're trying to find . 'Kay you have something that picks up a voice from far away { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : It 's a good point . Project Manager : If it 's hidden under the couch { disfmarker } but then again you have this wee { disfmarker } this wee thing you know that 's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too . User Interface : A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television . Marketing : Mm . User Interface : And you just say something to { disfmarker } into that Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : and it Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : finds your { disfmarker } Marketing : K { vocalsound } Project Manager : Or an isolated magnet or something like , or you know something that would n't interfere I do n't know that 'd be the technical thing Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : but { disfmarker } yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system . User Interface : { vocalsound } The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market . Marketing : True . User Interface : And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k Marketing : Making it just an option ? Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not . Marketing : Yeah . Right . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : I was thinking uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Are we still thinking about this screen { disfmarker } sorry . Industrial Designer : Oh go ahead . Marketing : Go ahead . The uh if we 're gon na do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that 's an option technically right now to that ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : 'S definitely an option technically . I 've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not , Marketing : Okay . Okay . User Interface : they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point . Marketing : We 're doing okay . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : 'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have Project Manager : Mm . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you 're not gon na use every day and that a lot of people are n't gon na use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we 're going for . Industrial Designer : Got ta wonder though , if we 're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gon na be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : True . Worth looking into . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : It seems like , we 're not gon na be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : True . Yeah . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : So it 's just something to consider . Project Manager : Absolutely . Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we 'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know , that 's perfectly viable question . Mm 'kay um so I 'm seeing that we 're gon na just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we 'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we 've got a market for it uh I do n't think there 's too many , Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : we 'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well , we do n't have many um . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } I appear to have lost my microphone . Mm . { vocalsound } Right um we do n't have many people { vocalsound } or there 's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool . Um right . I guess we 've c we 've touched on most of this . The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . Um . The thing with { disfmarker } I see { vocalsound } would there not be a { vocalsound } we 'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Um I 'm not sure that 's sincerely correct , Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . Marketing : Mm . Just the casing . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : We could have the casing , the the face plates . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Back to the uh the cost { disfmarker } the material . { vocalsound } We have to ask whether we 're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? That 's something I w for { disfmarker } say we 're including three or four face plates , it 's gon na drive the cost up . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : And the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ? Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : We have n't done any tests on face plates and whether { disfmarker } Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : See if there { disfmarker } if there 's even interest out there . Project Manager : Okay . Right . Industrial Designer : Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that would n't really go anywhere . Project Manager : Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to { disfmarker } who all Marketing : Mm . Right . Project Manager : it 's not like with cell phones like where you have a { disfmarker } you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we 'd be just our model of pho of t remote control . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , it is sort of emblematic whereas you 're just sit at home , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : so unless somebody comes over to watch T_V_ { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm . Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } Yeah . User Interface : Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : True . True . True . User Interface : and most people have their televisions in the living room . Uh . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Alright well we can { disfmarker } we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um . Marketing : Yeah . Oh yeah . User Interface : Sure . Project Manager : { vocalsound } True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we 're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um { vocalsound } yeah we 'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what 's most important . Um I think we 've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ? User Interface : Well have we confirmed that we 're gon na go ahead with a uh touch screen um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah yeah okay . Um { disfmarker } User Interface : Interface ? Project Manager : Yeah I think that would be best . Let 's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let 's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that 's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that 's a great idea . With a touch screen for the basic functions . { vocalsound } Um { disfmarker } And we 'll yeah tha let 's provisionally { disfmarker } let 's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . Um do we have { disfmarker } Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . { vocalsound } Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost . Marketing : True . 'Cause it would have a docking base ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . But then again that costs as well . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years { vocalsound } even with the touch screen ? Project Manager : Do they ? Okay . User Interface : Those new ones . Industrial Designer : Can we afford to include one of those ? Marketing : Can we afford that ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : And will somebody buy it if we do n't ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well I I do n't think yeah I ca n't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we 'd have to see some kind of new battery technology . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Okay so let 's go with a um touch screen { vocalsound } with um some kind of { disfmarker } you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology { disfmarker } Marketing : For twelve Euros ? { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah well hey you know well it 's it 's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple Marketing : It is . Fair enough . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : you know so { disfmarker } you know . Well yeah I mean Marketing : The basics . Project Manager : you can put the { disfmarker } we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we 'll do the aesthetics . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : Okay so we 'll { gap } touch screen and the battery , focus on um { vocalsound } uh presentation . Marketing : 'Kay . Project Manager : Um { vocalsound } it 's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : and um a small paging function . Even if you ca n't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that 's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while { disfmarker } to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : Um right so any comments ? Thoughts before we break into { disfmarker } go into the next round of individual work on this . Industrial Designer : Since we 're doing uh touch screen , do we wan na look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gon na be one touch screen for everybody . User Interface : Be interesting . Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um Marketing : { vocalsound } And { gap } oh . Industrial Designer : logo or something or motto , I ca n't remember exactly what you said . Marketing : Yeah the { vocalsound } the fashion User Interface : We put fashion into electronics . Marketing : do . Yeah . Project Manager : W it 's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you 'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . Marketing : Right , and then you 're dealing with ports and cords and { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah I think perhaps { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : 'S too much . Project Manager : good idea but yeah Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : I think that that one m might just be um and they just { disfmarker } yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular { disfmarker } Marketing : For now . Project Manager : a P_D_A_ would { disfmarker } they would { disfmarker } makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you 're gon na be using it to connect up to things anyway but { disfmarker } I dunno , what do you guys think ? Industrial Designer : Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . Marketing : Yeah . Nice . Industrial Designer : That 'd be okay . User Interface : Yeah . Uh I I 'm I 'm in agreement with that , I 'm wondering how we 're gon na get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device . Marketing : Um . Well but if we 're gon na use a touch screen where it 's gon na come on like on your cell phone it 'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it 's loading Project Manager : Hmm . Marketing : and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Comes on every time you turn it on and then that 's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think . Industrial Designer : Mm . True . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } I 'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Y { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there . User Interface : { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Jus Marketing : Yeah you would think . Project Manager : But apparently not . Marketing : But . Project Manager : So . Industrial Designer : People are n't gon na want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . Marketing : If it comes from above . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : They just want it to be on and ready to go . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well fair enough . Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it { disfmarker } the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Kind of if i User Interface : Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on . Project Manager : Oh Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode . User Interface : Yep . Goes into a sleep mode . Project Manager : Okay . { vocalsound } Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . Um . Um cool so any last things before we break ? Alright . Fair enough . Sounds good . Marketing : We 're good ? Project Manager : I 'm gon na save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . I 'm gon na save a copy of this and the minutes that I 'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference . User Interface : I 've put my files in the shared folder as well . Project Manager : Brilliant . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 's fab guys . Cool . 
Query : Summarize the brief presentations on personal ideas towards the design . Industrial Designer : Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ? Project Manager : Oh , right yeah . Marketing : Got ta plug you in . Project Manager : Yep . Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it 's gon na come up . Yep . Cool . Industrial Designer : Okay . Right . That 's page one of my presentation . Project Manager : Brilliant . Marketing : Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it 's lovely . Industrial Designer : So the uh method . We 're gon na have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there 's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there 's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that 's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there 's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that 'd be really bad . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } 'Kay . Industrial Designer : Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it 's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was { disfmarker } since we ca n't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : The chip , um , silicon based chip I do n't really see any way around that , we ca n't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I 'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that 's a word I made up , I do n't really know what it means . Project Manager : 'Kay . Fair enough . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range . Project Manager : 'Kay . Industrial Designer : Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it 'll only be T_V_s . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply ca n't afford this kinds of lawsuits Marketing : Fine . Industrial Designer : which adm admittedly is gon na come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics Industrial Designer : 'cause we were thinking { disfmarker } Project Manager : that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white { disfmarker } like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice , Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : It needs , yeah . Project Manager : you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ? Industrial Designer : Yeah that should n't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that 's perfectly possible for us to do . Project Manager : Okay , okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } That 's the end of my presentation . Marketing : Cool . Project Manager : Great . Thank you very much Nathan . { vocalsound } Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that 'd be great as well . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : S plug yourself in here . Mm . { vocalsound } Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down { disfmarker } Mm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Looks like you 're in okay . Industrial Designer : Is it plugged in well ? There it goes . Computer adjusting . User Interface : Th Project Manager : There you go . Sweet . Marketing : There you go . User Interface : Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that 's no problem . Project Manager : Yeah sorry I could n't get that g to use before . User Interface : Um so some of my findings . Um basically wan na send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we 're all quite uh quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does . Um { vocalsound } now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we ca n't quite see my red there very well Project Manager : Oh yeah look at that . Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } User Interface : but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : and most users will find it uh find that they wo n't use most of the functions because they do n't know how to use them and do n't wan na take the time to learn how to do it . As you also notice it 's quite a boring design . Um . Another remote control , slightly different , it 's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it 's also quite boring . So Project Manager : { vocalsound } Nice . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : my personal preferences . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . And I was gon na add another uh slide here but I did n't quite have time there . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . User Interface : Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it 's uh { gap } . Project Manager : Great . Thanks for that Ron . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : { vocalsound } 'Kay Marketing : Does that mean I 'm up ? Project Manager : yep that 's you . Marketing : I think so . Okay . User Interface : I can plug you in . Marketing : Oh that would be perfect . Thank you . Slide show up and running . Project Manager : Give it a little bit . Marketing : Or not . Uh . Oh there we go . Perfect . Okay . So this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we 've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort { disfmarker } like watching a hundred people { vocalsound } use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they 're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they do n't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody 's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that 's all that 's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they 're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public 's use , they 're not using a lot of it , they do n't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they do n't know what to do with . { vocalsound } And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their { disfmarker } the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they ca n't find it in the room . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . { vocalsound } Um there 's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : and pretty much they all think they 're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I do n't know if that 's something we 're ready to look into technically , that 's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic 's obviously the one that 's gon na keep growing , so if that 's the direction we 're headed in it 's something to think about . Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards . { vocalsound } So it 's a good start for us . Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 's great . Thank you Sarah . Right . So um Marketing : Need to unplug this ? Project Manager : yep I 'll just uh switch that back here . Marketing : Need it back . Project Manager : I 'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase . Marketing : There you go . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Right so I think we 've covered most of these important questions through this um { vocalsound } through you guys 's presentations um { vocalsound } we 've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . { vocalsound } Um Sarah , she 's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , Marketing : Oh right . Project Manager : { vocalsound } um so do we wan na go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is { vocalsound } um { vocalsound } we 've got w if we 're gon na go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics { vocalsound } um . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } We 're not catering to the pensioners of the world I do n't think so . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes . So maybe this { disfmarker } we should look into this younger demographic . Um . So Marketing : Right . 
Query : Why did the Project Manager agree with Marketing when discussing his personal ideas towards the design ? Marketing : Or not . Uh . Oh there we go . Perfect . Okay . So this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we 've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort { disfmarker } like watching a hundred people { vocalsound } use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they 're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they do n't about their general T_V_ remote control practices .

Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 's great . Thank you Sarah . Right . So um Marketing : Need to unplug this ? Project Manager : yep I 'll just uh switch that back here . Marketing : Need it back . Project Manager : I 'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase . Marketing : There you go . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Right so I think we 've covered most of these important questions through this um { vocalsound } through you guys 's presentations um { vocalsound } we 've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . { vocalsound } Um Sarah , she 's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , Marketing : Oh right .

User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes . So maybe this { disfmarker } we should look into this younger demographic . Um . So Marketing : Right . 
Query : What did the group talk about the functions and buttons of the remote control ? Industrial Designer : With a simple command like locate . And then it could start to beep Marketing : Yeah . Something very basic . Industrial Designer : and Marketing : Right . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Right . Industrial Designer : therefore be found . User Interface : Sounds good . Marketing : Is that only gon na be within our two hundred foot range then ? Industrial Designer : Oh yeah I think that 's very doable . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you could n't speak into the remote that you 're trying to find . 'Kay you have something that picks up a voice from far away { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : It 's a good point . Project Manager : If it 's hidden under the couch { disfmarker } but then again you have this wee { disfmarker } this wee thing you know that 's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too . User Interface : A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television . Marketing : Mm . User Interface : And you just say something to { disfmarker } into that Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : and it Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : finds your { disfmarker } Marketing : K { vocalsound } Project Manager : Or an isolated magnet or something like , or you know something that would n't interfere I do n't know that 'd be the technical thing Marketing : Yeah . 
Query : Why did the Project Manager put forward to cut down the functions when discussing the design of the functions and buttons of the remote control ? Marketing : menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you 're not gon na use every day and that a lot of people are n't gon na use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we 're going for . Industrial Designer : Got ta wonder though , if we 're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gon na be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : True . Worth looking into . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : It seems like , we 're not gon na be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : True . Yeah . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : So it 's just something to consider . Project Manager : Absolutely . Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we 'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know , that 's perfectly viable question . Mm 'kay um so I 'm seeing that we 're gon na just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we 'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control . 
Query : What did the Project Manager elaborate on the members when discussing the materials of the television remote ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we 're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um { vocalsound } yeah we 'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what 's most important . Um I think we 've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ? User Interface : Well have we confirmed that we 're gon na go ahead with a uh touch screen um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah yeah okay . Um { disfmarker } User Interface : Interface ? Project Manager : Yeah I think that would be best . Let 's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let 's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that 's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that 's a great idea . With a touch screen for the basic functions . { vocalsound } Um { disfmarker } And we 'll yeah tha let 's provisionally { disfmarker } let 's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . Um do we have { disfmarker } Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . { vocalsound } Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost . Marketing : True . 'Cause it would have a docking base ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . But then again that costs as well . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years { vocalsound } even with the touch screen ? Project Manager : Do they ? Okay . User Interface : Those new ones . Industrial Designer : Can we afford to include one of those ? Marketing : Can we afford that ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : And will somebody buy it if we do n't ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well I I do n't think yeah I ca n't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we 'd have to see some kind of new battery technology . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Okay so let 's go with a um touch screen { vocalsound } with um some kind of { disfmarker } you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology { disfmarker } 
Query : What did the group talk about the appearance of the television remote ? Industrial Designer : What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um Marketing : { vocalsound } And { gap } oh . Industrial Designer : logo or something or motto , I ca n't remember exactly what you said . Marketing : Yeah the { vocalsound } the fashion User Interface : We put fashion into electronics . Marketing : do . Yeah . Project Manager : W it 's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you 'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . Marketing : Right , and then you 're dealing with ports and cords and { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah I think perhaps { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : 'S too much . Project Manager : good idea but yeah Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : I think that that one m might just be um and they just { disfmarker } yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular { disfmarker } Marketing : For now . Project Manager : a P_D_A_ would { disfmarker } they would { disfmarker } makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you 're gon na be using it to connect up to things anyway but { disfmarker } I dunno , what do you guys think ? Industrial Designer : Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . Marketing : Yeah . Nice . Industrial Designer : That 'd be okay . User Interface : Yeah . Uh I I 'm I 'm in agreement with that , I 'm wondering how we 're gon na get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device . Marketing : Um . Well but if we 're gon na use a touch screen where it 's gon na come on like on your cell phone it 'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it 's loading Project Manager : Hmm . Marketing : and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Comes on every time you turn it on and then that 's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think . Industrial Designer : Mm . True . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } I 'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Y { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there . User Interface : { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Jus Marketing : Yeah you would think . Project Manager : But apparently not . Marketing : But . Project Manager : So . Industrial Designer : People are n't gon na want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . Marketing : If it comes from above . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : They just want it to be on and ready to go . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well fair enough . Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it { disfmarker } the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Kind of if i User Interface : Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on . Project Manager : Oh Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode . User Interface : Yep . Goes into a sleep mode . Project Manager : Okay . { vocalsound } Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . Um . Um cool so any last things before we break ? Alright . Fair enough . Sounds good . 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Marketing : { vocalsound } Okay . Oh I totally { disfmarker } Yeah 'cause I moved it . { vocalsound } 'S put it over here . Then we do n't have to worry about it . User Interface : { vocalsound } Ready for this ? Project Manager : All set ? Cool . Alright , it is PowerPoint time . I 've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I 've ever done in my life before this experiment { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah { vocalsound } . Project Manager : which is kind of fun . User Interface : { vocalsound } Oh man . { vocalsound } Project Manager : So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um { vocalsound } { disfmarker } right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my { disfmarker } that my coach was sending to me . It means I 'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . Industrial Designer : Oh really ? Project Manager : I think . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : Huh . Project Manager : I do n't know . Otherwise it 's just saying I 'm the secretary Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Project Manager : and I 'm { disfmarker } therefore I 'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um { vocalsound } just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah that 's not you . { vocalsound } Project Manager : No . That 's how the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Wait . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh { disfmarker } last meeting was that { vocalsound } um we that we had meetings from { disfmarker } uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we 're operating with um { disfmarker } uh excuse me what limitations we 're operating under , what kind of risk we 'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you did n't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some { disfmarker } mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . { vocalsound } So . That 's sorted , back to the main { vocalsound } meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys . Industrial Designer : Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What 's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . This is going to be the on off button Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it 's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Ah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Nice . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : why not ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Fair enough . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Of course , if that 's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Perfect . Industrial Designer : Go ahead . User Interface : No it 's important to { vocalsound } we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we 've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here Marketing : Mm . User Interface : um f we call it fruity Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : if you will . Um . Right , um , Marketing : Appropriate , okay . User Interface : of course that 's uh interchangeable Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued Marketing : Mm 'kay . User Interface : but this is kind of something that can be done Marketing : It is an option . User Interface : um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Oh , right . Industrial Designer : That 's this here . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Ah . I see . User Interface : Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let 's see , well clearly there 's gon na be some more colours and what not available . { vocalsound } Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ? Industrial Designer : Um I worried about the materials , it is uh { disfmarker } the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it 's very durable uh , it 's not gon na break like some types of plastic that 's dropped . Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . User Interface : It 's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there 's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the uh the company 's name on the telephone screen , Project Manager : Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok Industrial Designer : I thought that was kinda nice . Marketing : Nice . Industrial Designer : This was actually an apple on the inside . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : This { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Do we need to worry about um rot factors ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Um { vocalsound } it 's encased in a new uh type of uh Marketing : Oh okay , there 's preservatives involved , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : polymer yeah . Marketing : we do n't need to worry , Industrial Designer : We got a bit ahead of ourselves , User Interface : It 's fine . Marketing : okay . Industrial Designer : I know we 're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but { disfmarker } User Interface : Hmm . Marketing : Fair enough . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Edible televisions , it 's a wave of the future . { vocalsound } Marketing : No but { disfmarker } User Interface : It 's pos a possible new product . Marketing : { vocalsound } It 's a couple years off at least . Okay . User Interface : Um , but I think that 's { disfmarker } I think that sums up the main features of our { disfmarker } of the remote , Project Manager : Brilliant . Industrial Designer : Right . User Interface : um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh { disfmarker } whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . Um , did we come in under budget ? Industrial Designer : Uh we did , yeah . This cost { disfmarker } well to put this into um production , we 're looking at about { disfmarker } what was our goal ? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Um , so I was quite pleased with that . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : One thing that we did n't do um { disfmarker } obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : we did n't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that 's what helped keep the cost down . Project Manager : Brilliant . Industrial Designer : So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : in a lot of ways it 's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper . Marketing : Okay . User Interface : Mm . { vocalsound } Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ? Industrial Designer : And { disfmarker } Oh no , we have n't talked about that yet have we ? User Interface : So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay . User Interface : and uh I think it 's nicely designed into the into the overall look . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier Marketing : Mm 'kay . User Interface : and um , I think that uh has given a proven um { vocalsound } ease of use and what not . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Yeah . User Interface : And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Cool . Industrial Designer : Any questions ? Project Manager : No , no Marketing : { vocalsound } Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ? Project Manager : I think that 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : In play now or are those ones gon na be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? Industrial Designer : Um , do you wan na answer this one Marketing : Do we know where we stand on that yet ? Industrial Designer : or do you want me to answer it ? User Interface : Well we did n't quite have enough material uh { vocalsound } . Marketing : Oh I was n't expecting a prototype Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . User Interface : Oh I see , Marketing : I just did n't know { disfmarker } if you guys had any in mind yet . { vocalsound } User Interface : right , um . Industrial Designer : Um , well { vocalsound } as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it 'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like { disfmarker } Marketing : Okay . Just veneer really , User Interface : Right . Marketing : yeah . Okay . User Interface : Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips Marketing : Mm-hmm . User Interface : and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that . Marketing : And the whole thing { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay User Interface : So I mean there are { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } Marketing : Right User Interface : we definitely priced out a spongy { disfmarker } even spongier non-natural look um materials Marketing : Yeah . There 's { disfmarker } Okay . User Interface : which I think worked out fine . We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple 's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green . Marketing : Mm 'kay . Okay , very cool . Industrial Designer : It 's not it 's not quite a a face plate , it 's more like a pseudo-face plate because it 's simple enough Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : that in the factory it could { disfmarker } we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it 's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wan na go the other way it 's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : if you know what I mean . Marketing : Yep . It 's still an option if we need it . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Very cool , nice job . Project Manager : Right , yeah thanks guys that 's very , very good work . I like it , brilliant . { vocalsound } Um , { vocalsound } what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um I got me { disfmarker } you 've got { disfmarker } you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . Um , it 's a spreadsheet of the parts { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Oh . Project Manager : and I 've just tentatively put in what it 's going to look like um . Industrial Designer : Ooh . Project Manager : I 'm just gon na clear this out real quickly , but it looks like { disfmarker } So we 'll just { disfmarker } if we can just itemize what 's in here , we 've got this { disfmarker } it 's a solar cell thing right ? Industrial Designer : Right Project Manager : With a back-up battery ? Industrial Designer : uh we did n't really touch on that but it it 's in there , Project Manager : With the ba okay . Um Industrial Designer : yep . Project Manager : and { disfmarker } User Interface : The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . Yeah . Project Manager : Clever , clever , well done . Um so I guess that would mean we 've got a bit of a um { disfmarker } { vocalsound } It 's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time is n't it ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . It 's just making use of the same space and the same materials , Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Okay . Um and the case , it 's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that { disfmarker } be the general { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um and we 've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . Um . Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we 've got two push button interfaces do n't we ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , mm-hmm . Project Manager : Um . And um a special { disfmarker } I guess it 's uh { disfmarker } we 've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that { disfmarker } throughout , Industrial Designer : Yeah , special . Project Manager : yeah . Industrial Designer : And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , do n't you ? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , it 's it 's quite unique . Industrial Designer : I like to think of it as unconventional . Project Manager : I like it , yeah it 's { disfmarker } So it looks like Marketing : M come in at sixteen ? Project Manager : a bit over budget , um . Industrial Designer : Oh . Huh , does n't match up does it ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells { vocalsound } um or take out the back-up battery . Uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : How do you feel about that ? User Interface : I mean I think that uh if we 're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I 'm not sure that { disfmarker } you know what the sell is on that . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it 'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you 're gon na have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote is n't working User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : what am I gon na do ? Marketing : Mm k . Industrial Designer : People 'd be real upset . I think in the long-run it 's better to keep the battery , Marketing : True . Industrial Designer : it 's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that 's so integral to the theme that we have . Project Manager : Hmm . { vocalsound } What 's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just ca n't back out of now , Marketing : Nah . Project Manager : it would have to be { disfmarker } seems like we 'd have to go back to square one in a way . Um if we were gon na try to undo one bit we 'd probably have to undo most of it , um { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Although we do n't wan na get rid of the whole environmental { disfmarker } I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we 're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we 're actually coming in under budget if I 've done my math correctly . Industrial Designer : Hmm . User Interface : I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing Marketing : I mean { disfmarker } User Interface : I mean that 's what sets us apart Marketing : Which , it 's { disfmarker } User Interface : right ? Marketing : yeah that 's what setting us into this young market , I mean that 's where we started from , so { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I do n't know , and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . Industrial Designer : Right . User Interface : And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I 'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here Marketing : Right . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . User Interface : and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here Project Manager : It 's either or . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . Industrial Designer : Yeah . I guess we might have to do that . Marketing : I think unfortunately that 's our best option . Industrial Designer : It 's the only way we 're gon na get below our uh goal is n't it ? Of twelve fifty . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : 'Cause we ca n't remove the push buttons 'cause they 're { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah , { vocalsound } . Marketing : { vocalsound } It { disfmarker } kind of { disfmarker } Project Manager : um and we ca n't get rid of the uh { disfmarker } I mean removing the { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Savings . Marketing : yeah . Project Manager : changing the case would n't be so much of a { vocalsound } mm-mm , um , nor would changing the case materials . Marketing : Mm-mm . Project Manager : Um . So yeah that looks like to be the only thing . So that would be the { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : it 's a major change but { disfmarker } Yeah . Alright , so Industrial Designer : Got ta do what you got ta do . Project Manager : we 're in agreement on that . Marketing : Unfortunately I think we are . User Interface : No , I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Right . Moving along swiftly . Um , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over . Marketing : That would be me . Um cord ? Project Manager : Ah of course , sorry . Marketing : No problem . Project Manager : Whoosh . Marketing : Can you reach , User Interface : Yep . Marketing : that would be great , thank you . Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 'd be great { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } I did n't even do that one on purpose either , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : damn . Okay , um , basically I was just evaluating um { vocalsound } from what we know of how our product 's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of { disfmarker } these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they 're important . Um so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um . Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? Does it respond to voice recognition ? And overall , in general , it looks like it 's coming up to par . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it 's a new sort of interface , um that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Really good . Marketing : So I think overall we 're headed in the right direction . { vocalsound } So . User Interface : They like that spongy feel . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . It looks like it 's going over well , so User Interface : And the paging function works well , Industrial Designer : Six ? User Interface : that 's good to hear , Marketing : we 're we 're good yeah . User Interface : we worked hard on that one . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Brilliant . Industrial Designer : We did . Marketing : Yeah . It 's { disfmarker } I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we 've got is working in the range we need it for , so it 's all good . Industrial Designer : I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel Marketing : That 's everything from me . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : but it 's okay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Yeah , it is a set-back , but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay , do you need the cord back ? Project Manager : Um yeah , User Interface : W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again Project Manager : I was just { disfmarker } go on . Industrial Designer : I know . User Interface : that we 're { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well they do n't own tellys anyway do they ? Industrial Designer : True . User Interface : I guess that 's true . Project Manager : Right . So , um , { vocalsound } this one 's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . I got this slide from the coach and I 'm not sure what it 's connected to . Um so I guess we are going to discuss um { vocalsound } our project process um Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : and that is gon na go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go um { vocalsound } uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , um . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : As in within the team or ? Project Manager : I think so yeah . Industrial Designer : Right so it 's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or { disfmarker } Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : I think it 's { disfmarker } I mm-hmm , I think so . I think { vocalsound } hope I 'm not screwing up an experiment { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : 'Kay . Marketing : It is now , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : you 're in charge there you go { vocalsound } . so { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Whatever { vocalsound } . Project Manager : Um right , um so any thoughts ? Industrial Designer : Are we considering these points here ? Marketing : Um . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : I think they 're starting blocks yeah . Project Manager : What do you guys feel about the process ? Industrial Designer : { gap } Marketing : Um , you know I think in general , for a day 's worth of work we actually were { vocalsound } relatively productive , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . Marketing : considering the little amount of input we had going in . Um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it 's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . User Interface : We did n't use the whiteboard at all . Project Manager : No , no whiteboard . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No . Marketing : { vocalsound } No , we did n't . We could now if that 'd make up for it User Interface : { vocalsound } And { disfmarker } Marketing : but really { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , does n't really matter . User Interface : Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I do n't think I woulda used it at all , I did n't write barely anything . Marketing : Yeah I think I was taking { vocalsound } notes more often than usual Industrial Designer : Yeah , it 's true . Marketing : just 'cause I liked the pen , yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : Uh . Project Manager : Was pretty cool tack though . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Definitely . Marketing : Mm . I am disappointed I did n't get a note back from my personal coach . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : As you write your personal coach . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , but I did n't get a response { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } What if you get a response two or three months from now ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : so { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : we 'll see { vocalsound } . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : That 'd be weird . Marketing : Okay that would be kinda creepy . Project Manager : Attempts to contact coach ineffective { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Well User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : what kind of coaching is that really ? What if I really needed something . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } I { disfmarker } so n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , I do n't we could do whatever { disfmarker } basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um . Marketing : I think so . And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it 's not everything we wanted it to be . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : With the natural look . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Very natural look . Industrial Designer : That 's very natural . Marketing : { vocalsound } Organic , really . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 's the brilliance of { disfmarker } they had a p they had a peeler in here . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : And highly resourceful team mates might I add Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : which is always a plus . Project Manager : Yeah , I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean . User Interface : { vocalsound } I think the teamwork was good as well . Marketing : Mm yeah , I 'm impressed . Industrial Designer : And to prove that we were n't wasteful we did n't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit . Marketing : { vocalsound } Nice . All four of those little containers . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern . Industrial Designer : Yeah , User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I guess { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : My one my one criticism is that we did n't have enough colours to work with , Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : we only had four , was n't enough . Marketing : You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I know it could have been amazing . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Oh well . Project Manager : What did you guys think about the the the roles ? Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : They were good { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : Yeah it 's f kind of fun , it was { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . Marketing : True . Industrial Designer : At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Do your own . Industrial Designer : which was kind of fun . Marketing : Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : I mean maybe it 's just me but I did n't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . Project Manager : That 's true , I I got this spreadsheet { vocalsound } . Marketing : Nothing , I did n't even get an email , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : like Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : that was it . So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . User Interface : Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to { disfmarker } Marketing : Whatever . Project Manager : Of what to do . User Interface : well no but also { disfmarker } yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Uh-huh , that was n't very much . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : You know { disfmarker } User Interface : um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was Marketing : Mm . User Interface : because that was kind of the interface portion Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : which was what the whole project was about Marketing : Yes . Project Manager : Mm , mm . User Interface : uh Marketing : Hmm , very much so . User Interface : but { disfmarker } and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , Industrial Designer : Yeah . That was fun . I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you User Interface : which was fine . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : 'cause if we did n't have that there 's no way we could have got all that done in time . Marketing : Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . Very much so . Project Manager : Cool . User Interface : And I think your leadership was quite good . Industrial Designer : It was really good yeah . Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : She said I I I she actually made a comment off { gap } boy you 're getting into this and I really I think it 's true I did get { disfmarker } I I felt like I got way too into it . Marketing : Yeah . That 's kind of a good thing though , Project Manager : I felt like I slipped into it a lot . Industrial Designer : It 's kinda fun . Marketing : you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey . Project Manager : I dunno . User Interface : An so is that the first time you 've taken on that kind of role ? Project Manager : The first time I 've ever done anything like yeah project project management . I usually organise crap , Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : it 's one thing to do , you know { disfmarker } set up a party with your friends , User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : you know ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Little different . Project Manager : But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the { disfmarker } okay ? Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } I had to admit , as soon as w we started { disfmarker } I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh , { vocalsound } th { vocalsound } you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window { vocalsound } . Marketing : other than that { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } I could only imagine . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too , User Interface : Possibly . Project Manager : like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos { disfmarker } did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos { disfmarker } User Interface : Oh yeah , Marketing : Yeah . Totally . Project Manager : everybody knows { disfmarker } best spaceships ever . User Interface : still have 'em . Project Manager : Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Marketing : I think so . User Interface : Yep . Project Manager : Hmm . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } You do n't . Project Manager : I do n't { disfmarker } I I was just { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } Marketing : Though we did n't actually { disfmarker } I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there was n't { disfmarker } except for the actual building , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : It 's true huh ? Marketing : but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board { disfmarker } well and this would have been six months ' worth of work , not like three hours ' worth of meetings . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . I mean Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : That 's true . Project Manager : Yeah . Course I 'm I 'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there 's a team { vocalsound } you know it 's like , kind of like , like hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : It d Marketing : Yeah that is kind of { disfmarker } Project Manager : But yeah . Interesting . It 's kind of fascinating was n't it ? I mean the whole process of { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Wonder why { disfmarker } is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? Project Manager : I do n't know . { vocalsound } I I do n't know if there was a ri I th Marketing : Mine was the mics . I did n't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , Industrial Designer : Yeah , that 's it Marketing : I was afraid I was gon na break something actually . Industrial Designer : 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it 's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board . Marketing : Yeah . True , but it did n't even occur to me as an option , Project Manager : Nor I . Marketing : I mean I do n't know that I would have but I know that I consciously did n't . User Interface : I mean it 's just like the paper I do n't know what I really needed the paper for . Marketing : True . User Interface : Um , because I 've got this laptop . Standard , Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : I just used it 'cause it 's literally right in front of me . Project Manager : I wan na see the output files from these um , from the digital paper . Marketing : Yeah . Well it looks really professional . Project Manager : I wan na see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized Marketing : I know . Project Manager : because my handwriting is crap . Industrial Designer : Yeah , Project Manager : I mean , just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . Industrial Designer : that 's it . Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I did n't because { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : I know , I felt like I needed to be professional so I did n't like draw all over my paper and stuff . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Okay , well not entirely , but still , I doodled less than I usually do . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : T I I 'm curious about what the de-briefing is gon na be like . You know , like what is the uh what exactly we 're looking for here . User Interface : So is this all we need to get through ? Project Manager : I dunno , I 'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . Marketing : I guess . Industrial Designer : New ideas . Marketing : Um . User Interface : Is it { disfmarker } Marketing : It { disfmarker } did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? Project Manager : Well , that 's the thing I got { disfmarker } i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there , Marketing : That slide was like that ? Project Manager : mm-hmm . I did n't change this one at all . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : Well . Project Manager : Um ch Industrial Designer : I guess we 're on the right track . Project Manager : Yeah well . { vocalsound } User Interface : Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : W { gap } { vocalsound } I kinda like th Industrial Designer : No , none . Marketing : Uh I think they still do their job . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah you ca n't { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I think they 're fine actually . Marketing : I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah , maybe a s a circle would be alright , different . Marketing : I do n't { disfmarker } Yeah . Project Manager : Does kinda make you wonder , I mean , how much can you do with a remote control ? It 's like inventing a new car . Yeah yeah , you can { disfmarker } Marketing : It 's still got ta be technically car shaped or it wo n't fit on the road , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : you know ? { vocalsound } Do n't know . Project Manager : Hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um . 'Kay . User Interface : What is that ? Our limited ability to think outside the box ? Project Manager : So this was other costs . Marketing : Kind of . Industrial Designer : Are we back into project mood ? Project Manager : I dunno . I think this is Marketing : Oh , how long was our meeting supposed to be ? Project Manager : forty ish Marketing : How much time do we have left ? Project Manager : I I I mm we should go on a bit { disfmarker } yeah { disfmarker } about the project eval , um . I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . Like , what like you know what am I really doing , Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : you know what is { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work Project Manager : Yep . Marketing : and I was like { disfmarker } had like all this brainstorming I was doing Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : and then suddenly I was like well it 's just another two minute presentation that you guys do n't really care about anyway User Interface : { vocalsound } Why ? Project Manager : Hey . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : so type away . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Huh I think it was the real { gap } . Marketing : You know , you know what I mean Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it did n't feel like it mattered anymore . Industrial Designer : Definitely when { vocalsound } when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to { disfmarker } how much I stressed over it User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much . Marketing : Whatever . { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what 's given to you into your presentation Industrial Designer : Yeah { vocalsound } . Marketing : { vocalsound } Very much , yeah . User Interface : which uh was n't so clear to me at the beginning . Project Manager : { vocalsound } I actually did n't do that at all though , Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : every single one I { disfmarker } a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em . I di User Interface : Oh I added like five slides too , Marketing : { vocalsound } See Project Manager : Oh . Industrial Designer : Did you really ? User Interface : but I { disfmarker } Marketing : I only got blank ones . Industrial Designer : I just got blank ones Project Manager : What ? Really ? Industrial Designer : and { disfmarker } Marketing : My slides were all blank , they 'd have a title maybe User Interface : Yeah , mine too . Marketing : and they were just empty . Project Manager : Did they not have { disfmarker } they did n't like { disfmarker } uh mine { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Me too . Project Manager : yeah they did n't come like this ? Like with { disfmarker } this was what it looks like . This is what that looked like , Marketing : Like with those words already on it ? Project Manager : literally , just like that . User Interface : No . Marketing : No . Project Manager : Interesting . Marketing : I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh-huh huh huh . Industrial Designer : I deleted slides { vocalsound } . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : I think I added a slide one time . User Interface : I added many slides every time { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Hey Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class . User Interface : Yeah { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : That was pretty cool , it was a high moment of the whole experiment . User Interface : { vocalsound } Um . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : Interesting . Any other thoughts come to mind ? Marketing : I wan na know how our product would fare . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I think it would fail , I think Marketing : I ca n't just leave it there . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : it 'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } I think it would take extensive marketing , okay , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . { vocalsound } But you know the whole { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : Even you { vocalsound } . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : I do n't { disfmarker } we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah but { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : I know it is { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : It 's a happy face . User Interface : Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications { vocalsound } . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Builds . Mm . User Interface : I hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random Kit-Kat bar Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } I I noticed that . { vocalsound } By accident . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : that happened to be consumed . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Interesting . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : Well huh . An interesting day all in all I would say . Project Manager : Uh , yeah , I 'd say so . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , it 's uh { disfmarker } User Interface : So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not . Project Manager : Mm , I know . Marketing : I know . User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . You know from the the the basics to the conce Industrial Designer : I wan na see a { disfmarker } Marketing : I Yeah . Project Manager : although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I do n't think I really understood like the concept . Well the id okay the notion of { disfmarker } Marketing : 'Cause it 's such a functional item . Project Manager : yeah I mean i it 's not like I have a concept of a mug 's material , it 's just it is what it is . You know , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of { disfmarker } we sh I I thought of I thought of { disfmarker } rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of proposed idea . And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever , Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : I dunno . But . All in all it 's kinda interesting . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : So we have more slides or ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : No just this closing one . No we 've established that the costs were n't really within budget , but we could s you know do it { disfmarker } Marketing : We got it to be . Project Manager : We did the project evaluation based on um { vocalsound } Sarah 's evaluation of on off switches Marketing : Like cutting corners . Kind of , Project Manager : and { disfmarker } Marketing : though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . Project Manager : Mm . True . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Which I 'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us . Project Manager : Yeah . 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um . Yeah . And it 's all recorded , woo-hoo . Yeah what I 'm gon na { disfmarker } I 'm gon na put um { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : Yay . Project Manager : I 'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I 'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like { disfmarker } maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I 'll put most of it in the reports . Industrial Designer : I { vocalsound } It 'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording . Marketing : { vocalsound } Make it sound eloquent . Oh , I have to done { disfmarker } I 've { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Nice . Marketing : I 've done transcription before and it 's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that Project Manager : Oh yeah . Marketing : that mean nothing . Project Manager : There 's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics . Industrial Designer : Really . User Interface : What the uhs and the { disfmarker } Marketing : There 's a guy studying it here , yeah , he 's studying ums and ahs or something . Industrial Designer : Filler words or ? Project Manager : Yep , they 're called um disfluencies . Industrial Designer : Disfluencies . Marketing : That 's a good word for it . Project Manager : Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Just add some prefixes , sounds classier . Project Manager : Exactly uh I will save this into the project documents . Industrial Designer : I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , Project Manager : Yeah . Oh yeah . { vocalsound } Yeah I know . User Interface : Mm . Marketing : I , yeah , Industrial Designer : like c come on gim me something . Marketing : pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Come on give me some information . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well to be fair we 're we 're hooked { disfmarker } we 're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , we are addicts . User Interface : That 's scary Industrial Designer : It is scary . User Interface : yeah ? Marketing : Mm . User Interface : Well just around that eight or or nine people that are { disfmarker } Project Manager : I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It 's only in the last ten that we 're like where 's the internet ? Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : I mean , you know , it just in the past five we 've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time . Marketing : I yeah . User Interface : Dude , I think we 've had internet for like eighteen years . Marketing : True . Project Manager : No we have but I { disfmarker } not in the sense that it 's so un you know uh ubiquitous Marketing : I yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : But it 's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still . Industrial Designer : It 's crazy . So { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Uh-huh . User Interface : In the eighties ? Marketing : My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : There 's basically the fundamental structures , but it was n't uh household to household yet User Interface : Right . Marketing : because it had n't been User Interface : Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something . Marketing : partitioned off and stuff , yeah that was him . User Interface : You guys ready to celebrate ? Project Manager : Yeah that 's our last step . Celebration . Marketing : Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Should . Project Manager : 'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . Marketing : I think so . I think that 's a closer . Project Manager : Cool . Industrial Designer : Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? { gap } this has been long enough . User Interface : { vocalsound } Celebrate . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Where do you find that ? Marketing : { vocalsound } I have no idea . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Is that the only song you have ? User Interface : There is another one . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Is this one of those media player ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Huh ? Project Manager : W oh . Industrial Designer : That 's awesome . User Interface : Yep . { vocalsound } Project Manager : The default track . I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball . Industrial Designer : Maybe I have a different one . Project Manager : That 's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version . Marketing : So is that a close ? Project Manager : Yeah , I guess we 'll call that a a doner . Marketing : Okay , that 's the end of the meeting . Project Manager : Fab . Marketing : Thank you gentlemen . I feel like I 'm signing off . 
Query : Summarize the review of some problems from the past meetings . Marketing : { vocalsound } Okay . Oh I totally { disfmarker } Yeah 'cause I moved it . { vocalsound } 'S put it over here . Then we do n't have to worry about it . User Interface : { vocalsound } Ready for this ? Project Manager : All set ? Cool . Alright , it is PowerPoint time . I 've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I 've ever done in my life before this experiment { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah { vocalsound } . Project Manager : which is kind of fun . User Interface : { vocalsound } Oh man . { vocalsound } Project Manager : So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um { vocalsound } { disfmarker } right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my { disfmarker } that my coach was sending to me . It means I 'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . Industrial Designer : Oh really ? Project Manager : I think . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : Huh . Project Manager : I do n't know . Otherwise it 's just saying I 'm the secretary Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Project Manager : and I 'm { disfmarker } therefore I 'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um { vocalsound } just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah that 's not you . { vocalsound } Project Manager : No . That 's how the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Wait . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh { disfmarker } last meeting was that { vocalsound } um we that we had meetings from { disfmarker } uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what sort of limitations we 're operating with um { disfmarker } uh excuse me what limitations we 're operating under , what kind of risk we 'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you did n't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some { disfmarker } mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . { vocalsound } So . That 's sorted , back to the main { vocalsound } meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys . Industrial Designer : Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What 's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . This is going to be the on off button Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it 's all put away , um . As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Ah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Nice . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : why not ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Fair enough . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Of course , if that 's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Perfect . Industrial Designer : Go ahead . User Interface : No it 's important to { vocalsound } we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we 've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here Marketing : Mm . User Interface : um f we call it fruity Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : if you will . Um . Right , um , Marketing : Appropriate , okay . User Interface : of course that 's uh interchangeable Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued Marketing : Mm 'kay . User Interface : but this is kind of something that can be done Marketing : It is an option . User Interface : um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Oh , right . Industrial Designer : That 's this here . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Ah . I see . User Interface : Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let 's see , well clearly there 's gon na be some more colours and what not available . { vocalsound } Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ? Industrial Designer : Um I worried about the materials , it is uh { disfmarker } the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it 's very durable uh , it 's not gon na break like some types of plastic that 's dropped . Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . User Interface : It 's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there 's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the uh the company 's name on the telephone screen , Project Manager : Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok Industrial Designer : I thought that was kinda nice . Marketing : Nice . Industrial Designer : This was actually an apple on the inside . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : This { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Do we need to worry about um rot factors ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Um { vocalsound } it 's encased in a new uh type of uh Marketing : Oh okay , there 's preservatives involved , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : polymer yeah . Marketing : we do n't need to worry , Industrial Designer : We got a bit ahead of ourselves , User Interface : It 's fine . Marketing : okay . Industrial Designer : I know we 're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but { disfmarker } User Interface : Hmm . Marketing : Fair enough . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Edible televisions , it 's a wave of the future . { vocalsound } Marketing : No but { disfmarker } User Interface : It 's pos a possible new product . Marketing : { vocalsound } It 's a couple years off at least . Okay . User Interface : Um , but I think that 's { disfmarker } I think that sums up the main features of our { disfmarker } of the remote , Project Manager : Brilliant . Industrial Designer : Right . User Interface : um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh { disfmarker } whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . Um , did we come in under budget ? Industrial Designer : Uh we did , yeah . This cost { disfmarker } well to put this into um production , we 're looking at about { disfmarker } what was our goal ? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Um , so I was quite pleased with that . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : One thing that we did n't do um { disfmarker } obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : we did n't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that 's what helped keep the cost down . Project Manager : Brilliant . Industrial Designer : So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : in a lot of ways it 's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper . Marketing : Okay . User Interface : Mm . { vocalsound } Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ? Industrial Designer : And { disfmarker } Oh no , we have n't talked about that yet have we ? User Interface : So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay . User Interface : and uh I think it 's nicely designed into the into the overall look . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier Marketing : Mm 'kay . User Interface : and um , I think that uh has given a proven um { vocalsound } ease of use and what not . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Yeah . User Interface : And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Cool . Industrial Designer : Any questions ? Project Manager : No , no Marketing : { vocalsound } Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ? Project Manager : I think that 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : In play now or are those ones gon na be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? Industrial Designer : Um , do you wan na answer this one Marketing : Do we know where we stand on that yet ? Industrial Designer : or do you want me to answer it ? User Interface : Well we did n't quite have enough material uh { vocalsound } . Marketing : Oh I was n't expecting a prototype Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . User Interface : Oh I see , Marketing : I just did n't know { disfmarker } if you guys had any in mind yet . { vocalsound } User Interface : right , um . Industrial Designer : Um , well { vocalsound } as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it 'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like { disfmarker } Marketing : Okay . Just veneer really , User Interface : Right . Marketing : yeah . Okay . User Interface : Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips Marketing : Mm-hmm . User Interface : and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that . Marketing : And the whole thing { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay User Interface : So I mean there are { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } Marketing : Right User Interface : we definitely priced out a spongy { disfmarker } even spongier non-natural look um materials Marketing : Yeah . There 's { disfmarker } Okay . User Interface : which I think worked out fine . We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple 's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green . Marketing : Mm 'kay . Okay , very cool . Industrial Designer : It 's not it 's not quite a a face plate , it 's more like a pseudo-face plate because it 's simple enough Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : that in the factory it could { disfmarker } we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it 's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wan na go the other way it 's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : if you know what I mean . Marketing : Yep . It 's still an option if we need it . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Very cool , nice job . Project Manager : Right , yeah thanks guys that 's very , very good work . I like it , brilliant . { vocalsound } Um , { vocalsound } what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um I got me { disfmarker } you 've got { disfmarker } you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . Um , it 's a spreadsheet of the parts { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Oh . Project Manager : and I 've just tentatively put in what it 's going to look like um . Industrial Designer : Ooh . Project Manager : I 'm just gon na clear this out real quickly , but it looks like { disfmarker } So we 'll just { disfmarker } if we can just itemize what 's in here , we 've got this { disfmarker } it 's a solar cell thing right ? Industrial Designer : Right Project Manager : With a back-up battery ? Industrial Designer : uh we did n't really touch on that but it it 's in there , Project Manager : With the ba okay . Um Industrial Designer : yep . Project Manager : and { disfmarker } User Interface : The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . Yeah . Project Manager : Clever , clever , well done . Um so I guess that would mean we 've got a bit of a um { disfmarker } { vocalsound } It 's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time is n't it ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . It 's just making use of the same space and the same materials , Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Okay . Um and the case , it 's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that { disfmarker } be the general { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um and we 've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . Um . Push button interface um with this other drop-down so maybe we 've got two push button interfaces do n't we ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , mm-hmm . Project Manager : Um . And um a special { disfmarker } I guess it 's uh { disfmarker } we 've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that { disfmarker } throughout , Industrial Designer : Yeah , special . Project Manager : yeah . Industrial Designer : And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , do n't you ? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , it 's it 's quite unique . Industrial Designer : I like to think of it as unconventional . Project Manager : I like it , yeah it 's { disfmarker } So it looks like Marketing : M come in at sixteen ? Project Manager : a bit over budget , um . Industrial Designer : Oh . Huh , does n't match up does it ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells { vocalsound } um or take out the back-up battery . Uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : How do you feel about that ? User Interface : I mean I think that uh if we 're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I 'm not sure that { disfmarker } you know what the sell is on that . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it 'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you 're gon na have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote is n't working User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : what am I gon na do ? Marketing : Mm k . Industrial Designer : People 'd be real upset . I think in the long-run it 's better to keep the battery , Marketing : True . Industrial Designer : it 's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that 's so integral to the theme that we have . Project Manager : Hmm . { vocalsound } What 's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just ca n't back out of now , Marketing : Nah . Project Manager : it would have to be { disfmarker } seems like we 'd have to go back to square one in a way . Um if we were gon na try to undo one bit we 'd probably have to undo most of it , um { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Although we do n't wan na get rid of the whole environmental { disfmarker } I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we 're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we 're actually coming in under budget if I 've done my math correctly . Industrial Designer : Hmm . User Interface : I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing Marketing : I mean { disfmarker } User Interface : I mean that 's what sets us apart Marketing : Which , it 's { disfmarker } User Interface : right ? Marketing : yeah that 's what setting us into this young market , I mean that 's where we started from , so { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I do n't know , and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . Industrial Designer : Right . User Interface : And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I 'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here Marketing : Right . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . User Interface : and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here Project Manager : It 's either or . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . Industrial Designer : Yeah . I guess we might have to do that . Marketing : I think unfortunately that 's our best option . Industrial Designer : It 's the only way we 're gon na get below our uh goal is n't it ? Of twelve fifty . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : 'Cause we ca n't remove the push buttons 'cause they 're { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah , { vocalsound } . Marketing : { vocalsound } It { disfmarker } kind of { disfmarker } Project Manager : um and we ca n't get rid of the uh { disfmarker } I mean removing the { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Savings . Marketing : yeah . Project Manager : changing the case would n't be so much of a { vocalsound } mm-mm , um , nor would changing the case materials . Marketing : Mm-mm . Project Manager : Um . So yeah that looks like to be the only thing . So that would be the { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : it 's a major change but { disfmarker } Yeah . Alright , so Industrial Designer : Got ta do what you got ta do . Project Manager : we 're in agreement on that . Marketing : Unfortunately I think we are . User Interface : No , I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Right . Moving along swiftly . Um , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over . Marketing : That would be me . Um cord ? Project Manager : Ah of course , sorry . Marketing : No problem . Project Manager : Whoosh . Marketing : Can you reach , User Interface : Yep . Marketing : that would be great , thank you . Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 'd be great { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } I did n't even do that one on purpose either , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : damn . Okay , um , basically I was just evaluating um { vocalsound } from what we know of how our product 's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of { disfmarker } these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they 're important . Um so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um . Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? Does it respond to voice recognition ? And overall , in general , it looks like it 's coming up to par . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it 's a new sort of interface , um that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Really good . Marketing : So I think overall we 're headed in the right direction . { vocalsound } So . User Interface : They like that spongy feel . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . It looks like it 's going over well , so User Interface : And the paging function works well , Industrial Designer : Six ? User Interface : that 's good to hear , Marketing : we 're we 're good yeah . User Interface : we worked hard on that one . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Brilliant . Industrial Designer : We did . Marketing : Yeah . It 's { disfmarker } I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we 've got is working in the range we need it for , so it 's all good . Industrial Designer : I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel Marketing : That 's everything from me . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : but it 's okay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Yeah , it is a set-back , but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay , do you need the cord back ? Project Manager : Um yeah , User Interface : W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again Project Manager : I was just { disfmarker } go on . Industrial Designer : I know . User Interface : that we 're { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well they do n't own tellys anyway do they ? Industrial Designer : True . User Interface : I guess that 's true . 
Query : Why did n't the Industrial Design agree with the User Interface when discussing the problems of the financial issue ? Industrial Designer : People 'd be real upset . I think in the long-run it 's better to keep the battery , Marketing : True . Industrial Designer : it 's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that 's so integral to the theme that we have . Project Manager : Hmm . { vocalsound } What 's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just ca n't back out of now , Marketing : Nah . Project Manager : it would have to be { disfmarker } seems like we 'd have to go back to square one in a way . Um if we were gon na try to undo one bit we 'd probably have to undo most of it , um { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Although we do n't wan na get rid of the whole environmental { disfmarker } I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we 're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we 're actually coming in under budget if I 've done my math correctly .

Query : What did the Project Manager think about their presentation contents when reflecting on their meetings and project progress ? Project Manager : Right . So , um , { vocalsound } this one 's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . I got this slide from the coach and I 'm not sure what it 's connected to . Um so I guess we are going to discuss um { vocalsound } our project process um Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : and that is gon na go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go um { vocalsound } uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , um . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : As in within the team or ? Project Manager : I think so yeah . Industrial Designer : Right so it 's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or { disfmarker } Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : I think it 's { disfmarker } I mm-hmm , I think so . I think { vocalsound } hope I 'm not screwing up an experiment { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : 'Kay . Marketing : It is now , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : you 're in charge there you go { vocalsound } . so { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough . 
Query : What did the group talk about as their reflection on the meetings and their progress ? Project Manager : Right . So , um , { vocalsound } this one 's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . I got this slide from the coach and I 'm not sure what it 's connected to . Um so I guess we are going to discuss um { vocalsound } our project process um Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : and that is gon na go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go um { vocalsound } uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , um . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : As in within the team or ? Project Manager : I think so yeah . Industrial Designer : Right so it 's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or { disfmarker } Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : I think it 's { disfmarker } I mm-hmm , I think so . I think { vocalsound } hope I 'm not screwing up an experiment { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : 'Kay . Marketing : It is now , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : you 're in charge there you go { vocalsound } . so { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Whatever { vocalsound } . Project Manager : Um right , um so any thoughts ? Industrial Designer : Are we considering these points here ? Marketing : Um . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : I think they 're starting blocks yeah . Project Manager : What do you guys feel about the process ? Industrial Designer : { gap } Marketing : Um , you know I think in general , for a day 's worth of work we actually were { vocalsound } relatively productive , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . Marketing : considering the little amount of input we had going in . Um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it 's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . User Interface : We did n't use the whiteboard at all . Project Manager : No , no whiteboard . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No . Marketing : { vocalsound } No , we did n't . We could now if that 'd make up for it User Interface : { vocalsound } And { disfmarker } Marketing : but really { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , does n't really matter . User Interface : Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I do n't think I woulda used it at all , I did n't write barely anything . Marketing : Yeah I think I was taking { vocalsound } notes more often than usual Industrial Designer : Yeah , it 's true . Marketing : just 'cause I liked the pen , yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : Uh . Project Manager : Was pretty cool tack though . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Definitely . Marketing : Mm . I am disappointed I did n't get a note back from my personal coach . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : As you write your personal coach . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , but I did n't get a response { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } What if you get a response two or three months from now ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : so { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : we 'll see { vocalsound } . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : That 'd be weird . Marketing : Okay that would be kinda creepy . Project Manager : Attempts to contact coach ineffective { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Well User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : what kind of coaching is that really ? What if I really needed something . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } I { disfmarker } so n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , I do n't we could do whatever { disfmarker } basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um . Marketing : I think so . And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it 's not everything we wanted it to be . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : With the natural look . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Very natural look . Industrial Designer : That 's very natural . Marketing : { vocalsound } Organic , really . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 's the brilliance of { disfmarker } they had a p they had a peeler in here . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : And highly resourceful team mates might I add Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : which is always a plus . Project Manager : Yeah , I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean . User Interface : { vocalsound } I think the teamwork was good as well . Marketing : Mm yeah , I 'm impressed . Industrial Designer : And to prove that we were n't wasteful we did n't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit . Marketing : { vocalsound } Nice . All four of those little containers . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern . Industrial Designer : Yeah , User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I guess { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : My one my one criticism is that we did n't have enough colours to work with , Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : we only had four , was n't enough . Marketing : You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I know it could have been amazing . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Oh well . Project Manager : What did you guys think about the the the roles ? Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : They were good { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : Yeah it 's f kind of fun , it was { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . Marketing : True . Industrial Designer : At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Do your own . Industrial Designer : which was kind of fun . Marketing : Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : I mean maybe it 's just me but I did n't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . Project Manager : That 's true , I I got this spreadsheet { vocalsound } . Marketing : Nothing , I did n't even get an email , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : like Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : that was it . So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . User Interface : Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to { disfmarker } Marketing : Whatever . Project Manager : Of what to do . User Interface : well no but also { disfmarker } yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Uh-huh , that was n't very much . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : You know { disfmarker } User Interface : um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was Marketing : Mm . User Interface : because that was kind of the interface portion Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : which was what the whole project was about Marketing : Yes . Project Manager : Mm , mm . User Interface : uh Marketing : Hmm , very much so . User Interface : but { disfmarker } and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , Industrial Designer : Yeah . That was fun . I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you User Interface : which was fine . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : 'cause if we did n't have that there 's no way we could have got all that done in time . Marketing : Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . Very much so . Project Manager : Cool . User Interface : And I think your leadership was quite good . Industrial Designer : It was really good yeah . Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : She said I I I she actually made a comment off { gap } boy you 're getting into this and I really I think it 's true I did get { disfmarker } I I felt like I got way too into it . Marketing : Yeah . That 's kind of a good thing though , Project Manager : I felt like I slipped into it a lot . Industrial Designer : It 's kinda fun . Marketing : you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey . Project Manager : I dunno . User Interface : An so is that the first time you 've taken on that kind of role ? Project Manager : The first time I 've ever done anything like yeah project project management . I usually organise crap , Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : it 's one thing to do , you know { disfmarker } set up a party with your friends , User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : you know ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Little different . Project Manager : But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the { disfmarker } okay ? Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } I had to admit , as soon as w we started { disfmarker } I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh , { vocalsound } th { vocalsound } you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window { vocalsound } . Marketing : other than that { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } I could only imagine . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too , User Interface : Possibly . Project Manager : like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos { disfmarker } did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos { disfmarker } User Interface : Oh yeah , Marketing : Yeah . Totally . Project Manager : everybody knows { disfmarker } best spaceships ever . User Interface : still have 'em . Project Manager : Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Marketing : I think so . User Interface : Yep . Project Manager : Hmm . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } You do n't . Project Manager : I do n't { disfmarker } I I was just { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } Marketing : Though we did n't actually { disfmarker } I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there was n't { disfmarker } except for the actual building , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : It 's true huh ? Marketing : but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board { disfmarker } well and this would have been six months ' worth of work , not like three hours ' worth of meetings . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . I mean Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : That 's true . Project Manager : Yeah . Course I 'm I 'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there 's a team { vocalsound } you know it 's like , kind of like , like hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : It d Marketing : Yeah that is kind of { disfmarker } Project Manager : But yeah . Interesting . It 's kind of fascinating was n't it ? I mean the whole process of { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Wonder why { disfmarker } is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? 
Query : What did the Industrial Design think about their teamwork when reflecting on the previous meetings and their project progress ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern . Industrial Designer : Yeah , User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I guess { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : My one my one criticism is that we did n't have enough colours to work with , Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah .

Project Manager : I do n't { disfmarker } I I was just { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } Marketing : Though we did n't actually { disfmarker } I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there was n't { disfmarker } except for the actual building , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : It 's true huh ? Marketing : but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board { disfmarker } well and this would have been six months ' worth of work , not like three hours ' worth of meetings . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . I mean Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : That 's true . Project Manager : Yeah . Course I 'm I 'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there 's a team { vocalsound } you know it 's like , kind of like , like hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : It d Marketing : Yeah that is kind of { disfmarker } Project Manager : But yeah . Interesting . It 's kind of fascinating was n't it ? I mean the whole process of { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Wonder why { disfmarker } is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Marketing : { vocalsound } That went well , thank you . Project Manager : That 's great . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } 'Kay . Marketing : Perfect . Project Manager : Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , do n't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it 's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it { disfmarker } 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we 'll come to some final decisions on what we 're gon na do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um . So , basically all we 're gon na do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gon na go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we 'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . { vocalsound } And then we 'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to . Industrial Designer : I 'll go first . Project Manager : Alright Nathan , Marketing : Go ahead . Project Manager : take it away . It is Nathan right ? I 'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? Industrial Designer : No Nathan 's fine . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Good . Industrial Designer : It 's either Nathan or participant two . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Mister participant two that is . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Nice . Industrial Designer : Okay . Um , Project Manager : Nice . Industrial Designer : basically what I 'm gon na have to talk to you about today is um component design and it 's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : so { disfmarker } Basically what I 'm gon na be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We 've already kind of gone over this but we 're gon na have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer did n't say anything about lithium so we might have to look { disfmarker } if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there 's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it 's like a um { disfmarker } the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that 's one possibility but I do n't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : So we 'll have to look into that . Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it 's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably do n't wan na do , curved or very sexy double curved . Project Manager : What kind of th thickness are we looking at ? Industrial Designer : Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I do n't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah . Project Manager : Okay , brilliant . Industrial Designer : Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we 'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we 'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons are n't compatible with that . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : Um and just a little note there , Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Right . Nice . Industrial Designer : Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you ca n't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record { disfmarker } if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part { disfmarker } use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . Marketing : Interesting . Industrial Designer : Course it 'd have to be a part of the spectrum that would n't damage the human eye or anything like that . Project Manager : { vocalsound } M Maybe { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm . Good call . Project Manager : is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Choose it . Industrial Designer : I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah I like the idea , it 's a good idea . Industrial Designer : Yeah , just as a fun gimmick . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we 're gon na use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really do n't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Um findings , okay , we 're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ? User Interface : Interesting question . Industrial Designer : 'S a bit of a challenge question . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : Yes . Marketing : Well I 'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Right , that 's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we 'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is { disfmarker } I 'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that 's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about { disfmarker } I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we 're not so confined by one style and say some { disfmarker } you know , say our { disfmarker } the one { disfmarker } Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : if we just go with one and it does n't go over well then we 're in a bad situation . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind { disfmarker } before we launch { disfmarker } can we see how they 're received ? Marketing : Um { disfmarker } It 's an option , uh but actually there 's { disfmarker } I 've got some research already on like what we 're looking at and trends in casing right now Project Manager : Okay . Okay . Marketing : which actually might even come into play beforehand , Project Manager : Okay , perfect . Marketing : it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway . Project Manager : Great , thank you very much Nathan . Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , you 're welcome . Project Manager : That 's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here . Marketing : { vocalsound } I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Did you ? { vocalsound } Marketing : You waiting for me ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : Fascinating , compelling even . Marketing : I know , what a teaser ai n't it . Um . { vocalsound } Right . So User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : current market trends . Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what 's going on in the remote control market right now and what 's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what 's what 's trendy , what 's new , what 's happening . Um , remote control right now { disfmarker } basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting { disfmarker } they 're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um { disfmarker } that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Now I 'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we ca n't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be Project Manager : { vocalsound } Tomatoes . { vocalsound } Marketing : a different shape Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : or { vocalsound } okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of { disfmarker } and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } I like it , I like it . { vocalsound } Marketing : uh not something I I 've come up with a { gap } though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use { disfmarker } we can use a rubber as part of the case , Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : it has a consistency of those stress balls . User Interface : Yes . Marketing : Mm . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Slick , slick . User Interface : Fabulous . Marketing : Might be an interesting way to go . Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . So overall I think we should stick with what we 're finding , everyone 's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new { disfmarker } I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Um . Project Manager : Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing is n't gon na work out for us that 's really a non-issue . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I like the idea of of rubber too because it 's { disfmarker } tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it does n't matter . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : 'Cause so many { disfmarker } Marketing : True . Industrial Designer : you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls . Marketing : Very true . Very true . Project Manager : Yeah , it 's like , yep { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Taped with duck tape and what have you , Marketing : Very much so { vocalsound } . Um Industrial Designer : you would n't have that problem if you used rubber . Project Manager : it 's ubiquitous is n't it ? User Interface : We can have a duck tape casing . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : We could . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } It could go with the granola crowd . Marketing : but worth a shot . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Ah , it could be , it could be , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Great , Marketing : um . Yeah that 's what I know . Project Manager : thanks for that Sarah . Marketing : No problem . Project Manager : Ron ? User Interface : Phew . Computer 's adjusting . One moment please . So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . Here 's a d series of different remote controls Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : that are out on the market today . I think we 're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look . Project Manager : Yeah User Interface : Um , so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I 'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um { disfmarker } with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it 'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line Marketing : { vocalsound } Mm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team User Interface : { vocalsound } On the remote control Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Project Manager : at the { gap } { vocalsound } User Interface : right . Marketing : Yeah . Very true , very true . User Interface : Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : which I am sure most of you know about . Marketing : Mm . User Interface : Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern { gap } a bit bulky , a bit crazy , Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : I do n't think that 's we 're necessarily going for . Industrial Designer : No . User Interface : And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your { disfmarker } for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I { disfmarker } again if we go with touch screen I do n't think that 's a big issue . Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Yeah , I can see . { vocalsound } User Interface : Um , again probably not what we 're going for Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : so I { disfmarker } I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we 're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing Marketing : Okay . User Interface : although I think some of the suggestions we 've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . Uh changeable casings uh { disfmarker } our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it Marketing : Mm , right . User Interface : and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those do n't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . Um , and of course our voice command system which I 've talked a little bit about already Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . Marketing : Mm . User Interface : And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : has jokes when it 's ready . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Nice . Project Manager : Great . User Interface : And uh that is about it . Project Manager : Great , wonderful Ron , cool . Lot of good ideas , good facts to have . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : That 's what they need , it 's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you do n't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom . Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . { vocalsound } Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um { vocalsound } various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? Marketing : I think it 's our most marketable feature just because it 's so new and it 's something that is showing up in other places . Project Manager : 'Kay . 'Kay . Marketing : But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : right ? Industrial Designer : My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it 's gon na cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , Project Manager : To produce each one . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Per ? Industrial Designer : yeah that 's just an estimate though . Marketing : Piece . User Interface : Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } I know Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : You industrial designers . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I know . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Hmm . Industrial Designer : It 's fun . { vocalsound } Marketing : And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? Project Manager : Well . Marketing : Do we remember ? Industrial Designer : I thought there was some flexibility with that . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : There is , it 's just , it is a question of { disfmarker } and how much ca o does that mean we 're gon na have to increase the price to make money . Marketing : Can we justify it ? Project Manager : Um , from twelve fifty if we d wan na get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin { vocalsound } um that would mean selling it from twenty five . If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that 's thirty five . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } User Interface : Where do you guys come up with these numbers ? Industrial Designer : That 's just off the top of my head , Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } From the board , Industrial Designer : it is pending further emails . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Right . Project Manager : um , well { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : Though I think that 's what people would pay for , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : I mean if you 're gon na pay for an expensive high class remote , you 're gon na expect it to do something { disfmarker } Project Manager : That 's true , I mean { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : It is the new { disfmarker } it would be in a class of its own . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } And that 's { disfmarker } to be fair the um the per cent of the market { disfmarker } we 're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we 're gon na make { disfmarker } I mean we we 're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just could n't , not for twenty-five Euros , Marketing : Right . Project Manager : so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that 's something that we can have finance deal with . Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ? User Interface : I 'm thinking that 's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the uh { disfmarker } on the third floor suggested that uh { disfmarker } Marketing : See if we can cut some corners . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : It 's true . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on { disfmarker } Marketing : Right . It 's a starting point anyway , so . Project Manager : No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there 's always the opportunity , if it 's gon na be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we { disfmarker } yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let 's let 's say that okay so the touch screen will be our { vocalsound } um { vocalsound } our main selling point here . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } So { disfmarker } User Interface : I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah 'cause with voice recognition { disfmarker } I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote . Project Manager : { vocalsound } The voice rec thing , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : I mean , { vocalsound } if if we 're looking at bottom line , now we 're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : I think we might have to drop the voice rec . Marketing : I think we 'd have to decide between 'em definitely . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , Marketing : Price-wise . User Interface : I mean we 've we 've come up with this , with this new voice { disfmarker } Marketing : True . User Interface : we 're using it for our coffee machines already . Marketing : We 've already got it . User Interface : I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh { disfmarker } guy down the hall . Sounds good . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Hmm . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ? Industrial Designer : I think if we { disfmarker } we do both the { disfmarker } obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into { disfmarker } it 'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . It would be very nice . Marketing : Pretty much . User Interface : I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say . Marketing : Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . Course , maybe they had n't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we 're not gon na use it even though we know it 'll sell is a call I do n't think I can give the highs ups . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Like really I ca n't go in and say no we 're gon na just ignore everything we know . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Does having both really up our costs ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } I ca n't see how it would n't , I mean , there 's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . You know , you ca n't you ca n't have all three . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah , 'cause you { disfmarker } you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function . Project Manager : It 's just impossible . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Well if we 're gon na pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . Um . Otherwise , yeah , we just { disfmarker } it just becomes cost prohibitive . What { disfmarker } which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? Marketing : Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that 's what 's gon na sell I think that 's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . Industrial Designer : I would have to side with that , Project Manager : 'Kay . Industrial Designer : I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the { disfmarker } all the technology in-house , it 's ready to go , it 's packaged , it 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Well my p { vocalsound } is { disfmarker } Project Manager : Nathan ? Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would { disfmarker } they 're both mm they 're both gon na push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : we 're not gon na have to do as much design work Marketing : { vocalsound } Right . Industrial Designer : and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean . Project Manager : Right . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Um , I definitely have to agree with that last comment . Marketing : And we 're still not { disfmarker } then we do n't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : we can stick with what we 've already got . In a lot other ways too . Project Manager : Okay . So I 'm getting { disfmarker } alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . Okay . Marketing : I think it 's our lower risk option Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : which for right now { disfmarker } we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option . Project Manager : Okay . Sorted . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . User Interface : It 's you and me outside a little here . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : So and when are we gon na have basic prototypes coming up next that 's { disfmarker } you guys 's next step right ? Project Manager : Yeah , well we 'll we 'll sic we 'll sort out what it { disfmarker } what { vocalsound } f what else we 're gon na talk about for the prototype Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : but yeah that 's our next step , it 'll be a developing of prototype . Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we 're gon na use for the case and all those things ? Project Manager : Yes . We 'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ? Industrial Designer : Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there 's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote has n't been exposed to { disfmarker } Marketing : Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement , Project Manager : Mm . Yep . Marketing : like what if { disfmarker } wha we ca n't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : It 's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : and you know how those those do n't really require that much light , User Interface : Calculator . Marketing : Yeah . True . True . Industrial Designer : um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we 're not talking about a lot of light . Does n't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Right . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : What do you think Ron ? User Interface : I 'm willing to agree with everything that 's been said . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Uh I have to say though that um another idea 's come up in my head . If we 're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something . Marketing : Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : Interesting . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? User Interface : Just a thought . Industrial Designer : What 's the uh idea ? User Interface : Well if you do n't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . Marketing : I if it 's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Do you think people that are { disfmarker } people that buy a remote , are they always gon na wan na use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes . Marketing : True , and i probabl I think we 're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , Project Manager : Well we have to have buttons on it too as well . Marketing : right . Project Manager : But that 's done , that 's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have { disfmarker } or like um { vocalsound } who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Yep . Project Manager : I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : it could still have the basic buttons on it . Um , 'cause we 're going for basic functionality primarily as well . Marketing : With the bu yeah . Project Manager : And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out . Industrial Designer : I think , I think you 're on to something Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is { disfmarker } would be good , even though { disfmarker } and hand-held the same time . Marketing : True . Way to go . User Interface : { vocalsound } I think it 's all about following Apple 's lead on a lot of these things . Marketing : Yeah I 'm thinking of the airport portal , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : you know like that little pod looking thing ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , those are nice . User Interface : Exactly . Project Manager : Yeah , I mean a nice { disfmarker } although we do um wh uh is { disfmarker } I 'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing Marketing : Right . Project Manager : and get back to it Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um { disfmarker } Marketing : That would be kinda neat . Terracotta bowl or something . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . Um , let 's see what we can do as far as that goes . And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh { disfmarker } using like a rubber kind of softer feel , Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : um you know Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it 's a bit { disfmarker } gives just a bit . You know Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : something where it 's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . Industrial Designer : Right . Just kind of the squishy feel . Marketing : Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that 's not gon na hurt us either . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm 'kay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah let 's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it { disfmarker } literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah I like it , I like the idea , that 's good . Marketing : Handy . Project Manager : Um and we 've sorted of discussed costs , { vocalsound } um . I guess we 'll a that 's gon na be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um . Industrial Designer : Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just have n't been provided that information by our manufacturers Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } We 'll have more of an idea when the prototype { disfmarker } have more of a { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : and I 'm just having to guess . Project Manager : we 'll have more of an idea later on . Um . And we just yeah go from there . { vocalsound } Um , so User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : we 've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , um , I think so we 're more or less con we { disfmarker } wh wh we 're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um { vocalsound } a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex . Marketing : Mm . Right . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I 'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those should n't be { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Like maybe have menu things . Marketing : Take precedence , Industrial Designer : If , if we 're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out Marketing : yeah . Industrial Designer : like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things . Marketing : And they slide . Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : Well and do we wan na consider like an iPod screen which is n't a touch screen but you 're still scrolling through menu options , in p User Interface : { vocalsound } Think then we 're hitting our cost issue again . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah Marketing : True , Project Manager : we 've also got the the me the thing of , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : we 're still not making it easier then . Project Manager : if we 're gon na have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : True . Project Manager : B But no I mean Marketing : Fair enough . Project Manager : we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it { disfmarker } say it 's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it 'd be easy to have a compartment in there . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um { disfmarker } like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players 'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them Marketing : Mm-hmm . Yeah it 's just a scroll . Project Manager : and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So are we gon na { disfmarker } are we talking { disfmarker } we need to figure out what kind of buttons we 're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well it seems like { vocalsound } I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um { disfmarker } stick with the rubber 'cause since we 're probably gon na be using some kind of um { vocalsound } rubber for the outside case Marketing : Yeah . Probably . Project Manager : we might as well stick with that um . Industrial Designer : Right . User Interface : I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command . Marketing : Right . Mm . Well no it 's basic just like four directions that are { disfmarker } that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wan na do it , are really versatile and everybody 's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it 's not like we 're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that 's not something anybody 's gon na wan na buy a new for . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Mm 'kay , um . { vocalsound } We 've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling { vocalsound } um and we we 've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Right , particularly in technological fields , Project Manager : Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Marketing : so that 's exactly where we 're headed . Project Manager : Okay . { vocalsound } Um . Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype . User Interface : Well what are we actually doing ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Right . User Interface : What were { disfmarker } Project Manager : I was just gon na step on to um { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : Uh . Oh it was n't in the way but { disfmarker } yeah , whatever . Project Manager : I was n't ? Oh , my bad { vocalsound } um sorry . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : No , do n't worry about it . Project Manager : The um , yeah okay I was just gon na assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth User Interface : Sure . Project Manager : any other final thoughts before we go ahead and Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : { disfmarker } cool ? Industrial Designer : So Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : have we decided that we are gon na go with different style cases for different people ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um . Industrial Designer : Or are we just going to go with one ? .. It 's very , it 's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it does n't go very well { disfmarker } mm . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : It 's a tough situation , Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : but obviously having more cases also costs more so { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well then again colours would n't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I do n't know , olive green or something . Industrial Designer : There 's an idea . Marketing : Mm . Yeah . Project Manager : That would n't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the { gap } thing . User Interface : And again copying iMac 's kind of { disfmarker } for iPod Mac Apple 's uh colour scheme . Marketing : Yeah , get in there . Yeah , totally . Project Manager : Yeah , I think that 's probably a good id okay so let 's work on { vocalsound } uh multiple case colours . But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda { disfmarker } yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . Cool . Alright , so we 'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh { disfmarker } I 'd like { disfmarker } Nathan , I 'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we 're just gon na sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : And um Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , { vocalsound } um { vocalsound } using um { vocalsound } prototype building materials um { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . Industrial Designer : Oh excellent yeah . Project Manager : So that 's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ? Marketing : Cool . Industrial Designer : That sounds good . User Interface : Fabulous . Project Manager : Alright . I guess we 'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys . Marketing : Cool . 
Query : Summarize the ideas of the individual presentations . Marketing : { vocalsound } That went well , thank you . Project Manager : That 's great . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } 'Kay . Marketing : Perfect . Project Manager : Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , do n't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it 's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it { disfmarker } 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we 'll come to some final decisions on what we 're gon na do for the prototype . Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um . So , basically all we 're gon na do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gon na go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we 'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . { vocalsound } And then we 'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to . Industrial Designer : I 'll go first . Project Manager : Alright Nathan , Marketing : Go ahead . Project Manager : take it away . It is Nathan right ? I 'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? Industrial Designer : No Nathan 's fine . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Good . Industrial Designer : It 's either Nathan or participant two . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Mister participant two that is . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Nice . Industrial Designer : Okay . Um , Project Manager : Nice . Industrial Designer : basically what I 'm gon na have to talk to you about today is um component design and it 's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : so { disfmarker } Basically what I 'm gon na be doing is talking to you about that . Um , components of a remote control , okay . We 've already kind of gone over this but we 're gon na have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer did n't say anything about lithium so we might have to look { disfmarker } if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there 's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it 's like a um { disfmarker } the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that 's one possibility but I do n't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : So we 'll have to look into that . Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it 's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably do n't wan na do , curved or very sexy double curved . Project Manager : What kind of th thickness are we looking at ? Industrial Designer : Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I do n't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . Yeah . Project Manager : Okay , brilliant . Industrial Designer : Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we 'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we 'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons are n't compatible with that . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : Um and just a little note there , Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Right . Nice . Industrial Designer : Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you ca n't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record { disfmarker } if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part { disfmarker } use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . Marketing : Interesting . Industrial Designer : Course it 'd have to be a part of the spectrum that would n't damage the human eye or anything like that . Project Manager : { vocalsound } M Maybe { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm . Good call . Project Manager : is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Choose it . Industrial Designer : I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah I like the idea , it 's a good idea . Industrial Designer : Yeah , just as a fun gimmick . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we 're gon na use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really do n't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Um findings , okay , we 're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ? User Interface : Interesting question . Industrial Designer : 'S a bit of a challenge question . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : Yes . Marketing : Well I 'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Right , that 's my concern too . Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we 'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is { disfmarker } I 'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that 's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about { disfmarker } I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . So we 're not so confined by one style and say some { disfmarker } you know , say our { disfmarker } the one { disfmarker } Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : if we just go with one and it does n't go over well then we 're in a bad situation . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind { disfmarker } before we launch { disfmarker } can we see how they 're received ? Marketing : Um { disfmarker } It 's an option , uh but actually there 's { disfmarker } I 've got some research already on like what we 're looking at and trends in casing right now Project Manager : Okay . Okay . Marketing : which actually might even come into play beforehand , Project Manager : Okay , perfect . Marketing : it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway . Project Manager : Great , thank you very much Nathan . Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , you 're welcome . Project Manager : That 's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here . Marketing : { vocalsound } I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Did you ? { vocalsound } Marketing : You waiting for me ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : Fascinating , compelling even . Marketing : I know , what a teaser ai n't it . Um . { vocalsound } Right . So User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : current market trends . Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what 's going on in the remote control market right now and what 's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what 's what 's trendy , what 's new , what 's happening . Um , remote control right now { disfmarker } basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting { disfmarker } they 're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um { disfmarker } that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Now I 'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we ca n't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be Project Manager : { vocalsound } Tomatoes . { vocalsound } Marketing : a different shape Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : or { vocalsound } okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of { disfmarker } and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } I like it , I like it . { vocalsound } Marketing : uh not something I I 've come up with a { gap } though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use { disfmarker } we can use a rubber as part of the case , Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : it has a consistency of those stress balls . User Interface : Yes . Marketing : Mm . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Slick , slick . User Interface : Fabulous . Marketing : Might be an interesting way to go . Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . So overall I think we should stick with what we 're finding , everyone 's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new { disfmarker } I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Um . Project Manager : Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing is n't gon na work out for us that 's really a non-issue . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I like the idea of of rubber too because it 's { disfmarker } tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it does n't matter . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : 'Cause so many { disfmarker } Marketing : True . Industrial Designer : you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls . Marketing : Very true . Very true . Project Manager : Yeah , it 's like , yep { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Taped with duck tape and what have you , Marketing : Very much so { vocalsound } . Um Industrial Designer : you would n't have that problem if you used rubber . Project Manager : it 's ubiquitous is n't it ? User Interface : We can have a duck tape casing . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : We could . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } It could go with the granola crowd . Marketing : but worth a shot . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Ah , it could be , it could be , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Great , Marketing : um . Yeah that 's what I know . Project Manager : thanks for that Sarah . Marketing : No problem . Project Manager : Ron ? User Interface : Phew . Computer 's adjusting . One moment please . So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . Here 's a d series of different remote controls Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : that are out on the market today . I think we 're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look . Project Manager : Yeah User Interface : Um , so the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I 'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um { disfmarker } with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it 'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line Marketing : { vocalsound } Mm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team User Interface : { vocalsound } On the remote control Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Project Manager : at the { gap } { vocalsound } User Interface : right . Marketing : Yeah . Very true , very true . User Interface : Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : which I am sure most of you know about . Marketing : Mm . User Interface : Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern { gap } a bit bulky , a bit crazy , Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : I do n't think that 's we 're necessarily going for . Industrial Designer : No . User Interface : And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your { disfmarker } for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I { disfmarker } again if we go with touch screen I do n't think that 's a big issue . Um and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Yeah , I can see . { vocalsound } User Interface : Um , again probably not what we 're going for Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : so I { disfmarker } I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we 're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing Marketing : Okay . User Interface : although I think some of the suggestions we 've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . Uh changeable casings uh { disfmarker } our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it Marketing : Mm , right . User Interface : and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those do n't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . Um , and of course our voice command system which I 've talked a little bit about already Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . Marketing : Mm . User Interface : And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : has jokes when it 's ready . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Nice . Project Manager : Great . User Interface : And uh that is about it . Project Manager : Great , wonderful Ron , cool . Lot of good ideas , good facts to have . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : That 's what they need , it 's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you do n't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom . Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm . 
Query : Why did Industrial Design agree with the Marketing when discussing their presentations on the appearance design ? Industrial Designer : Hmm . I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use { disfmarker } we can use a rubber as part of the case , Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : it has a consistency of those stress balls . User Interface : Yes . Marketing : Mm . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Slick , slick . User Interface : Fabulous . Marketing : Might be an interesting way to go . Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . So overall I think we should stick with what we 're finding , everyone 's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new { disfmarker } I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Um . Project Manager : Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing is n't gon na work out for us that 's really a non-issue . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I like the idea of of rubber too because it 's { disfmarker } tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it does n't matter . 
Query : What did the User Interface think about their previous suggestions when discussing the user interface ? User Interface : although I think some of the suggestions we 've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . Uh changeable casings uh { disfmarker } our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it Marketing : Mm , right . User Interface : and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line . Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those do n't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . Um , and of course our voice command system which I 've talked a little bit about already Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . Marketing : Mm . User Interface : And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : has jokes when it 's ready . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Nice . Project Manager : Great . User Interface : And uh that is about it . 
Query : What did the group talk about the touch screen under the limitation of the budget ? Project Manager : Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . { vocalsound } Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um . Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um { vocalsound } various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? Marketing : I think it 's our most marketable feature just because it 's so new and it 's something that is showing up in other places . Project Manager : 'Kay . 'Kay . Marketing : But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : right ? Industrial Designer : My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it 's gon na cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , Project Manager : To produce each one . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Per ? Industrial Designer : yeah that 's just an estimate though . Marketing : Piece . User Interface : Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } I know Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : You industrial designers . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I know . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Hmm . Industrial Designer : It 's fun . { vocalsound } Marketing : And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? Project Manager : Well . Marketing : Do we remember ? Industrial Designer : I thought there was some flexibility with that . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : There is , it 's just , it is a question of { disfmarker } and how much ca o does that mean we 're gon na have to increase the price to make money . Marketing : Can we justify it ? Project Manager : Um , from twelve fifty if we d wan na get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin { vocalsound } um that would mean selling it from twenty five . If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that 's thirty five . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } User Interface : Where do you guys come up with these numbers ? Industrial Designer : That 's just off the top of my head , Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } From the board , Industrial Designer : it is pending further emails . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Right . Project Manager : um , well { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : Though I think that 's what people would pay for , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : I mean if you 're gon na pay for an expensive high class remote , you 're gon na expect it to do something { disfmarker } Project Manager : That 's true , I mean { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : It is the new { disfmarker } it would be in a class of its own . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } And that 's { disfmarker } to be fair the um the per cent of the market { disfmarker } we 're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we 're gon na make { disfmarker } I mean we we 're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just could n't , not for twenty-five Euros , Marketing : Right . Project Manager : so we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that 's something that we can have finance deal with . Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ? User Interface : I 'm thinking that 's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the uh { disfmarker } on the third floor suggested that uh { disfmarker } Marketing : See if we can cut some corners . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : It 's true . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on { disfmarker } Marketing : Right . It 's a starting point anyway , so . Project Manager : No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there 's always the opportunity , if it 's gon na be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we { disfmarker } yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let 's let 's say that okay so the touch screen will be our { vocalsound } um { vocalsound } our main selling point here . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } So { disfmarker } User Interface : I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah 'cause with voice recognition { disfmarker } I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote . Project Manager : { vocalsound } The voice rec thing , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : I mean , { vocalsound } if if we 're looking at bottom line , now we 're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : I think we might have to drop the voice rec . Marketing : I think we 'd have to decide between 'em definitely . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , Marketing : Price-wise . User Interface : I mean we 've we 've come up with this , with this new voice { disfmarker } Marketing : True . User Interface : we 're using it for our coffee machines already . Marketing : We 've already got it . User Interface : I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh { disfmarker } guy down the hall . Sounds good . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Hmm . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ? Industrial Designer : I think if we { disfmarker } we do both the { disfmarker } obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into { disfmarker } it 'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . It would be very nice . Marketing : Pretty much . User Interface : I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say . Marketing : Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . Course , maybe they had n't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we 're not gon na use it even though we know it 'll sell is a call I do n't think I can give the highs ups . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Like really I ca n't go in and say no we 're gon na just ignore everything we know . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Does having both really up our costs ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } I ca n't see how it would n't , I mean , there 's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . You know , you ca n't you ca n't have all three . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah , 'cause you { disfmarker } you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function . Project Manager : It 's just impossible . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Well if we 're gon na pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . Um . Otherwise , yeah , we just { disfmarker } it just becomes cost prohibitive . What { disfmarker } which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? Marketing : Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that 's what 's gon na sell I think that 's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . Industrial Designer : I would have to side with that , Project Manager : 'Kay . Industrial Designer : I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the { disfmarker } all the technology in-house , it 's ready to go , it 's packaged , it 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Well my p { vocalsound } is { disfmarker } Project Manager : Nathan ? Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would { disfmarker } they 're both mm they 're both gon na push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : we 're not gon na have to do as much design work Marketing : { vocalsound } Right . Industrial Designer : and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean . Project Manager : Right . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Um , I definitely have to agree with that last comment . Marketing : And we 're still not { disfmarker } then we do n't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : we can stick with what we 've already got . In a lot other ways too . Project Manager : Okay . So I 'm getting { disfmarker } alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . Okay . Marketing : I think it 's our lower risk option Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : which for right now { disfmarker } we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option . Project Manager : Okay . Sorted . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . User Interface : It 's you and me outside a little here . { vocalsound } 
Query : Why did the Marketing disagree with the Project Manager when talking about the touch screen under the limitation of the budget ? Project Manager : I think we might have to drop the voice rec . Marketing : I think we 'd have to decide between 'em definitely . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , Marketing : Price-wise . User Interface : I mean we 've we 've come up with this , with this new voice { disfmarker } Marketing : True . User Interface : we 're using it for our coffee machines already . Marketing : We 've already got it . User Interface : I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh { disfmarker } guy down the hall . Sounds good . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Hmm . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ? Industrial Designer : I think if we { disfmarker } we do both the { disfmarker } obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into { disfmarker } it 'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . It would be very nice . Marketing : Pretty much . User Interface : I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say . Marketing : Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . Course , maybe they had n't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we 're not gon na use it even though we know it 'll sell is a call I do n't think I can give the highs ups . 
Query : Why did the Industrial Design disagree with the User Interface when discussing the shape of the remote control ? User Interface : Uh I have to say though that um another idea 's come up in my head . If we 're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something . Marketing : Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : Interesting . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? User Interface : Just a thought . Industrial Designer : What 's the uh idea ? User Interface : Well if you do n't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . Marketing : I if it 's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Do you think people that are { disfmarker } people that buy a remote , are they always gon na wan na use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes . Marketing : True , and i probabl I think we 're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Project Manager : Excellent . So um I sent you the agenda , it was on the { disfmarker } in the project documents . I do n't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . Anyway , it 's { disfmarker } the meeting 's gon na follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we 'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you 've been up to . Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you 've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that 's { disfmarker } we need to know about the components ' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Right . Project Manager : Okay . Um , do you wan na start again ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay . Project Manager : Let me { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Right s { vocalsound } Project Manager : we 've got forty minutes . Industrial Designer : so I have n't made a PowerPoint presentation , Project Manager : { vocalsound } You have n't made a PowerPoint , okay . Industrial Designer : yeah , I I thought I 'll use the whiteboard instead . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Um mm , { vocalsound } Project Manager : Let 's hope the pen holds out . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : okay , so basically I 'll start off by { disfmarker } uh { vocalsound } I thought I 'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Okay , so uh I 'll start again with a brief introduction to { disfmarker } connect that anyway { disfmarker } brief introduction to the insides of a remote control Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . Yeah . Okay , so w what you see here is { disfmarker } so { vocalsound } this is the outside of the remote , right ? If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : uh { vocalsound } everything else is kind of { disfmarker } Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : on pressing this button I { disfmarker } a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . { vocalsound } So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . Right ? So that 's the important point here , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so these are the different options that we have . Okay . So the batteries , I 'll start with the battery , right ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our { disfmarker } uh the cells , yeah ? Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh thes these are the kind { disfmarker } different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? So . And dynamos . Um { vocalsound } Marketing : Does that mean like a wind-up one ? Industrial Designer : yeah , yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } A wind-up remote . Industrial Designer : So uh I do n't know if { disfmarker } even if you want to consider this , User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they 'll they 'll { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : since uh they 'll come internally from the company , they 'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : So { vocalsound } the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones . Marketing : You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : And charging their remote , Marketing : Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that 's just { disfmarker } Project Manager : yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Yeah , it 's a good option . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } So what was what was this k ka Industrial Designer : The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking . User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : Uh yeah . Industrial Designer : But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it 'll just lie there for a long while sometimes . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . For a remote , 'cause you { disfmarker } Yeah . Industrial Designer : But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also { vocalsound } made by the company . Marketing : Yay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Environment friendly . Okay { vocalsound } um so I 'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody 's perspective . Project Manager : Yeah { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : There are different cases that can be provided . They can be { disfmarker } basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : and they can be curved with { disfmarker } on both the sides . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } These are the three options , right ? Um { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah , Industrial Designer : Yeah , would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : mm-hmm . Yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Mm-hmm mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : uh there were different kind of supplements available , um like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Okay . Industrial Designer : Wo wo wood . Marketing : Did you say wool ? Project Manager : Wood , wood . Marketing : Wood . Oh right . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } Not wool . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } . Project Manager : { vocalsound } A fluffy remote . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , you 'll understand why when we get to my presenta { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : Oh really ? { vocalsound } Okay . Um the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Huh . Industrial Designer : so uh we can use even um { vocalsound } a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh { vocalsound } uh some space design equipment , so it 's kind of um uh it 'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but uh it can not be used on a double curved surface . If we choose this , we can not use titanium . For for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Uh okay , the interface options now . So { vocalsound } we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Ooh . Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Sony . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , something like that . Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } So , and they have { disfmarker } they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : The scroll plus push . So this is something that has been recently developed by the company , um { vocalsound } in the last decade , so not too recent . And L_C_D_s , we can have L_C_D_s . So these two are recent and and this is q quite old . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } The various electronic options are um uh { vocalsound } so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh { disfmarker } so there 's there 's a chip behind this one , right ? The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : or a regular or advanced . And uh the price goes up as we go down , obviously . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Um { vocalsound } okay , so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Um the { disfmarker } we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels . Right ? Um { vocalsound } and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender , which is { vocalsound } { disfmarker } did not explained what i what it was , but I 'm guessing that uh { vocalsound } { disfmarker } so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker . So I 'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . Yeah , on . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Um { vocalsound } and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : So , these are the different options that we have . Okay , so { vocalsound } th that 's that 's basically { disfmarker } now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um { vocalsound } uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that , keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Excellent . Do you wan na stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , sure . Sure . Yeah . Project Manager : you can sit down , but just { disfmarker } { vocalsound } we might need you to leap up . User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay . Project Manager : What are you , PowerPoint , or { disfmarker } User Interface : Um I have some PowerPoint , yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Oh . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ? User Interface : 'Kay . Project Manager : Some sort of radiation ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : No it 's got its little camera in there , { vocalsound } plug it in { gap } . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah , it should should do it . Yeah . Marketing : 'S a Project Manager : Right , interface concept . User Interface : Okay . Um to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the { disfmarker } this talk um this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk . Project Manager : That 's fine . User Interface : So um yeah , this time um I might not have them on the slides but I { vocalsound } I can just mention them aw again . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Okay . So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it 's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which { disfmarker } uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Um um the method I { vocalsound } employed this time was { vocalsound } a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then { vocalsound } um { vocalsound } analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and { vocalsound } also um { vocalsound } whether their appearance was was pleasant . Um { vocalsound } and then um { vocalsound } this uh this um { vocalsound } this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : So some findings um { vocalsound } um . So in in the case of many user interfaces , they 're just so full of buttons that it 's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it 's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . Um { vocalsound } okay , and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . Okay , some of them are here . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Um { vocalsound } well the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , oh oh oh , { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : sorry for that . 'S go back . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } That 's nice one . User Interface : Ah , no , please . Okay , so yeah , they 're quite big and have many many buttons . Actually { vocalsound } of the { disfmarker } of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it 's it 's the smallest and and with with least { disfmarker } uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice . Marketing : Ugly . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : { vocalsound } Um okay . So let 's carry on with this . Um { disfmarker } So uh um o other findings { disfmarker } um some new things um used , uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh . { vocalsound } Our own company has developed a new in user interface { disfmarker } uh wait , no this is not the one . Okay , there is a { disfmarker } { vocalsound } we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows { disfmarker } i it 's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display . Project Manager : It 's { disfmarker } yeah . User Interface : Um s another new development is a scroll button , which was also th also already mentioned . And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed { vocalsound } a new um { vocalsound } { vocalsound } uh programmable speech uh { vocalsound } mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it 's { disfmarker } it should be . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it 's { disfmarker } once once the mm { vocalsound } um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever . Project Manager : Uh-huh , hi { vocalsound } yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : So { vocalsound } I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include . Industrial Designer : Uh sorry , uh can you go back for a second ? Um { vocalsound } uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? Uh { vocalsound } oh yeah are th Project Manager : It 's like the { disfmarker } like you said , no ? The scroll scroll wheel . Marketing : Yeah , you ca n't { disfmarker } User Interface : No no , the scroll button is a different thing . I I have a picture if you { vocalsound } { disfmarker } just a moment , I 'll { vocalsound } I 'll show you . I was n't completely sure myself , but I think it 's just like um { vocalsound } it 's it 's a wheel , it 's like not separate buttons . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah . User Interface : Look , this one here . Marketing : Oh , it 's like the iPod . User Interface : But I 'm I 'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round , Marketing : G yeah , no , you can . User Interface : it 's like you press this or this or { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh it 's the iPod uh kind of uh { disfmarker } Marketing : It 's like it 's like where you { disfmarker } you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it 's kind of like that and you spin round Project Manager : { vocalsound } Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Alright , right . Okay , okay . Marketing : and it { disfmarker } yeah . It is { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : So instead of going down you just spin { disfmarker } yeah , yeah . Marketing : You just go round Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : and it is a bit weird at first , but it 's actually very like fast . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . Marketing : I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : so it 's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Do you know , if you 're lookin if you 're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you 're looking for something at T_ , then it 's a lot faster than the wheel , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : but you 've got a lot less control over it . Industrial Designer : Right . So maybe I should include that here as well , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : L_C_D_s um plus spinning . User Interface : { vocalsound } Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : It { vocalsound } it has to be small , simple . Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . Um and I I also thought uh { vocalsound } if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . There is { vocalsound } uh I think there is no reason why we could n't use something like this for for the remote control . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : So yeah , that 's uh that 's it . Project Manager : Excellent . Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Okay , I 've put the copy of the presentation in um the { disfmarker } Project Manager : The project documents . Marketing : yeah . Project Manager : Excellent . If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Cool . Project Manager : Here it comes . Okay . Marketing : Fabulous . Okay , cool . Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gon na be wanting in the the near future . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Okay . Right . Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect . So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Um , you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : And um , yeah it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : So um { vocalsound } uh maybe uh as you 're discussing things , is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here ? Marketing : So { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , yeah , sure . Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . So mm uh so it { vocalsound } Project Manager : That 's over on the interface , Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } yeah , Project Manager : if if you could put { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ? Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Um and an Project Manager : And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : yeah . Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ , Project Manager : so that means we need an advanced thing . Industrial Designer : I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who 's pressing buttons , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Depends how fast your television runs , really , do n't do n't you think ? I mean we 've got one of those um Telewest boxes Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait , and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time . And if you get the number in wrong , then it 's a bit of a pain , Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Right . { gap } Marketing : so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you do n't interrupt the picture on the screen , Marketing : You know ? Yeah . Project Manager : so if you 're watching something { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : That 's true , yeah , that 's also { disfmarker } Marketing : And i it would be like { disfmarker } I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what 's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen 's protected so it does n't actually get scratched . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that Industrial Designer : Mm right . Marketing : and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , Project Manager : And then you can flip it open . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : yeah . Industrial Designer : So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , I think so . Marketing : Yeah , so that kind of decides your whole chip thing . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : You you agree ? Maarika , yeah ? User Interface : Yep , yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Right . Industrial Designer : So L_C_D_s , yeah , definitely . Marketing : Okay ? Industrial Designer : Go on . Marketing : Cool . Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Sorry , I discovered clip art . { vocalsound } Um so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture . So I mean , I 'm taking this to mean , you know , curviness . Do you know ? 'Cause you do n't tend to get flat vegetables . You know ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : and possibly even uneven , Marketing : Yeah , bit of asymmetry and stuff . Project Manager : like not not symmet yeah . Marketing : But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there , Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : because { disfmarker } I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : so you wan na { disfmarker } you curve it so that it 's suitable for use with the right hand . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Um yeah Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : , I 'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy . { vocalsound } Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Something a bit squishy and { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , Industrial Designer : Yeah , we we have Marketing : but I mean y you have to { disfmarker } User Interface : So it could be like a rubbery { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : we have rubber , User Interface : { vocalsound } yeah , uh-huh . Industrial Designer : but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the { disfmarker } um with using { disfmarker } Marketing : Well I suppose you would n't get a remote uh { disfmarker } an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah , and it 'd help if you drop it , it protects it as well . Marketing : Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : To some degree . Industrial Designer : So if if we use uh latex cases , they wo n't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint , Project Manager : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : so um we could use { vocalsound } titanium , wood or plastic uh or uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other um power things . Industrial Designer : Yeah , w energy source . Marketing : If it 's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , Project Manager : { vocalsound } From { vocalsound } from bouncing it . Marketing : you could just { vocalsound } bounce it up and down { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , tap it on the desk , yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : You can have it as like a little ball to bounce , that flips open . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Um so yeah , um okay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . So probably double curved surface is the way to go , yeah , { gap } . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : Mm yeah . Industrial Designer : Or or curved at one end and flat on the top , because I I 'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera . Um { disfmarker } Marketing : You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , you know , it 's like how you put your hands so y it 's the least movement basically . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ? Project Manager : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : It uh { disfmarker } Marketing : No , I d I do n't think it makes a lot of difference . I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight , Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : but it 's curvy , so . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Uh I think uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , 'cause the { disfmarker } Marketing : Besides , you have four sides to a thing , so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ? Industrial Designer : Right . Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh Project Manager : Dunno . Industrial Designer : because um { vocalsound } according to the information that I have , I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is { disfmarker } are these three . Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : It does not say anything about uh whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all . Project Manager : Nothing to { vocalsound } open them . Marketing : Yeah . Uh it 's it 's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from . Industrial Designer : Right , yeah , yeah . Marketing : But no , my research did n't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : 'cause I had nothing better to do with my time . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Right . Okay . Marketing : Okay , cool . Project Manager : Anything else ? What 've we got ? Marketing : Uh combine style with a level of functionality , um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function . Industrial Designer : Cool , thanks . Project Manager : Okay , so . Marketing : Okay ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Thanks Project Manager : Looking at what we 've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Let 's let 's try to r rub off things and { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , rub off some of those . Industrial Designer : yeah , so um { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : hand dynamos are definitely out , right ? { vocalsound } You you got a wind { gap } dynamo , yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , User Interface : Yeah uh-hum yeah . Project Manager : it 's not { disfmarker } that 's not streamlined and sexy , { vocalsound } having a having a wind up . Industrial Designer : Okay . Um { vocalsound } kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal , Project Manager : I think tha Industrial Designer : but uh { vocalsound } it 's { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } It 's about the practicality of it really , is n't it ? You know ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , Marketing : I mean if { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Depends how much how much movement it really needs . Industrial Designer : Kinetic energy it needs { disfmarker } I do n't have too much technical information on that , Project Manager : Pr presumably if they 're suggesting it , then we could use it . Industrial Designer : yeah , right . Okay , let 's keep it option uh keep an option , Project Manager : I 'd I 'd keep it on . Industrial Designer : yeah . Um { vocalsound } the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , right ? It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah . Project Manager : We do n't want that User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah Project Manager : it 's no { disfmarker } it 's not not vegetable . User Interface : it 's { disfmarker } yeah . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Um { vocalsound } okay , we still have all all the options . Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : N wood is { disfmarker } I ca n't n { vocalsound } how do you uh I mean you ca n't keep it really small uh Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : you ca n't make it like thin and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : I ca n't imagine a m wooden remote control . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : The wood thing . Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , so I mean if the case { disfmarker } you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky Industrial Designer : Yeah { vocalsound } if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it 's likely to break , User Interface : wi mm-mm yeah . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : it 's it 's much more uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , and given that we 're we 're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : U yeah wood is not really { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Well it 's not very cleanable either , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } That 's true . Marketing : do you know . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : It 's it 's not { vocalsound } a practical { disfmarker } I mean it 's it 's alright for a table , but for a remote control , you know . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : And splinters and stuff and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : okay { vocalsound } wood is out . Marketing : It just m does n't make any sense , I think is the thing with wood . Industrial Designer : Right . User Interface : Yeah , yeah , in the case of remote control not really . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay , now for the really interesting stuff , the interface . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right , so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : but uh it seems to be { vocalsound } out of trend , you know , nobody seems to be { disfmarker } Marketing : You have to have some push-buttons , do n't you ? User Interface : Yeah , but you { disfmarker } um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , would n't you ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Mm right . Marketing : G yeah , yeah . User Interface : Yeah , so for channel numbers but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Oh , if if we have L_C_D_ displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display . User Interface : But I th yeah but { vocalsound } I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of { disfmarker } yeah , it 's faster Project Manager : Just for fast { disfmarker } User Interface : with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um { vocalsound } discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : but if you do want to use L_C_D_ , then you flip it open , Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : but it 's it it 's more time-consuming . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven . Industrial Designer : Mm right . Project Manager : And it { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : yeah { vocalsound } L_ { disfmarker } L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options . Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ? Or do we have just uh channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ? User Interface : { vocalsound } No , no , I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers , Industrial Designer : The numbers . User Interface : because it 's { disfmarker } uh otherwise people do n't want to flip through all the channels . Um { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_ ? Industrial Designer : Or { vocalsound } on the L_C_D_ we can , you know { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : G yeah , User Interface : Yeah , I would say buttons , Marketing : I would think buttons , yeah . Project Manager : Buttons . User Interface : because it 's { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay . Marketing : It 's it 's the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : So mm { disfmarker } Marketing : I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , User Interface : I Project Manager : Mm . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and { disfmarker } they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : but , you know , I mean most of the time { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : I mean there 's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_ , I think is the the the issue there . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay , so buttons definitely in but { disfmarker } oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um { disfmarker } Project Manager : I think that 's what { vocalsound } you guys are gon na do next , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Uh okay . Project Manager : so if we put down the key um { vocalsound } things that we want . Industrial Designer : Okay , okay , so the components . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right , so uh what about the the scrolling uh ? User Interface : Yeah but n I I 'm not completely um completely clear uh I { vocalsound } yeah , about the spinning wheel . So I think it { vocalsound } it does n't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing , Marketing : { vocalsound } E either or { disfmarker } User Interface : it 's uh { disfmarker } you can al include everything in the spinning if you Marketing : G yeah . Project Manager : Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say . User Interface : { disfmarker } yeah , yeah , Marketing : { vocalsound } I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel , User Interface : in that case . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : so you have to decide whether { disfmarker } you you know , you want to be going so fast or not . But I mean the the thing with this whole { disfmarker } if y you 're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it 's spongy , then I 'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : Mm um { disfmarker } Project Manager : But if you 've got a { disfmarker } if if you 've got a flipped thing , effectively it 's something that 's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . User Interface : Ah , but I mean you can { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side . Project Manager : Th { vocalsound } that would be on one side , uh-huh . Industrial Designer : I 'm not sure it 'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . { vocalsound } Uh i it { disfmarker } Project Manager : No , I think it 's just the casing rubber on the outside . User Interface : Yeah , I um I think so too , I mean the case would be { disfmarker } Marketing : You want an outside of rubber User Interface : yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons , Marketing : and then open it up and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber or something like that . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : rubber buttons , but then { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Or maybe like interchangeable cases . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : 'Cause I know like we 're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel , but I have like a { disfmarker } { vocalsound } you know , obviously my iPod 's not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it Industrial Designer : Right , right . Marketing : and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Right , Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : okay , so so that gives us a more trendy look as well . Um { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now . Industrial Designer : Right . Yeah , and uh we 're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , right ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 's right , Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : that 's what they 're after . Industrial Designer : So I 'll rub that out . { vocalsound } And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than { disfmarker } Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Yeah I think we { disfmarker } um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or { disfmarker } Marketing : That does n't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though . Project Manager : I guess . User Interface : Yeah , does { disfmarker } Project Manager : Bananas . { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . Banana 's yellow , { vocalsound } yeah , definitely . Marketing : Yeah , but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote { vocalsound } the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? So you could have like { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple Project Manager : Green . Yeah . Marketing : and that and then you 'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay . Um { vocalsound } okay , if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits . Uh since we 're having L_C_D_s there there 's no way that we 're will be able to { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } We need the advanced { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : so { vocalsound } it seems to be one area where we would want to spend . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So I 'll rub off the other two . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So are we discounting solar energy because rubber 's gon na be used in there somewhere or { disfmarker } Project Manager : That was the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Oh is { disfmarker } oh the constraint was uh { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } If { disfmarker } Project Manager : We ca n't have solar panels with rubber , so . Industrial Designer : yeah . Marketing : solar panels with the rubber . Industrial Designer : Yeah . So { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , okay , so we lose that I think . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Shall we go for { disfmarker } if we 're going for rubber , we think uh on { disfmarker } as our case , and then { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } And the buttons as well , I think . Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I think uh { vocalsound } Project Manager : We 've got five more minutes . Industrial Designer : we 'll have uh { vocalsound } { disfmarker } uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , a although it does seem uh interesting . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : But it does not hold any advantages as such for a { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : It 's just a gimmick . Project Manager : Yeah , Industrial Designer : yeah . Project Manager : mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Okay . Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Yeah . I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I 'd put them in , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Ye yeah , { vocalsound } we we do n't have too much information about it , um { disfmarker } Project Manager : but if it 's { disfmarker } Yeah . User Interface : Yeah , but it it { disfmarker } I think it should be quite cheap because it 's from our own company , yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } It 's from the company , so { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Okay . And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it 's flipped into each other . Industrial Designer : Flat on the top . Yeah . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : Can I pull the { vocalsound } thing out the back of your computer ? Marketing : Yeah , sure j Project Manager : Just so we can { disfmarker } Marketing : Sorry , do you want me to { disfmarker } Project Manager : Nothing , it 's right , I 'm just { disfmarker } There we go . Marketing : What does um I_C_S_ mean ? Industrial Designer : I_C_s ? Uh integrated circuits . Marketing : Okay , cool . So it 's advanced integrated circuits ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Uh oh now I 've gone too far . Industrial Designer : Uh um we we 're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . We 're on our way . Okay . { vocalsound } So we 've basically worked out that we 're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber Industrial Designer : Yep . Project Manager : and the buttons are also rubber . We 're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we 're incorporating voice recognition . That 's our overall concept , User Interface : { vocalsound } Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : and it 's gon na look sort of vegetable , Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } and be in bright vegetable colours . User Interface : Uh-huh . So { vocalsound } w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer { disfmarker } Marketing : Imagine it would be inside . Project Manager : I think it 's on the { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay . Marketing : So um actually that could like really cut down your thing , Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : so you 've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you 've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Yeah , okay . Marketing : Um so you 've still not got like a lot of stuff in the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-mm . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : You 've maybe got , you know { disfmarker } { vocalsound } like if you 're modelling on iPod you 've got five buttons and a wheel , Project Manager : On the { disfmarker } Mm-hmm . Marketing : and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one 's the little bit inside the wheel , Project Manager : In the centre , Marketing : yeah . Project Manager : yeah , sure . User Interface : Mm yeah . Project Manager : Okay , so now we 've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gon na work on the look and feel design , Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : which I 'll presume he 'll work out what that means . Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we 've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Cool . Project Manager : Is that all okay ? And anyone who has n't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so { disfmarker } in case we have to refer to it . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , okay . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Cool , I 'm gon na go and sit on my own . Project Manager : Y ah nobody wants to talk to you . Marketing : { vocalsound } I know , I 'm hated . Project Manager : Unplug yourself . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Hmm . { vocalsound } Marketing : I 've got a bit tangled up in all this { vocalsound } User Interface : So but { disfmarker } shall I move away first or shall I stay here with { disfmarker } Project Manager : I dunno , maybe I would car User Interface : we need to { disfmarker } 
Query : Summarize the presentations on remote components , user interface and market trends . Project Manager : Excellent . So um I sent you the agenda , it was on the { disfmarker } in the project documents . I do n't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . Anyway , it 's { disfmarker } the meeting 's gon na follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we 'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you 've been up to . Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you 've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that 's { disfmarker } we need to know about the components ' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Right . Project Manager : Okay . Um , do you wan na start again ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay . Project Manager : Let me { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Right s { vocalsound } Project Manager : we 've got forty minutes . Industrial Designer : so I have n't made a PowerPoint presentation , Project Manager : { vocalsound } You have n't made a PowerPoint , okay . Industrial Designer : yeah , I I thought I 'll use the whiteboard instead . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Um mm , { vocalsound } Project Manager : Let 's hope the pen holds out . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : okay , so basically I 'll start off by { disfmarker } uh { vocalsound } I thought I 'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Okay , so uh I 'll start again with a brief introduction to { disfmarker } connect that anyway { disfmarker } brief introduction to the insides of a remote control Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . Yeah . Okay , so w what you see here is { disfmarker } so { vocalsound } this is the outside of the remote , right ? If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : uh { vocalsound } everything else is kind of { disfmarker } Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : on pressing this button I { disfmarker } a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . { vocalsound } So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . Right ? So that 's the important point here , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so these are the different options that we have . Okay . So the batteries , I 'll start with the battery , right ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our { disfmarker } uh the cells , yeah ? Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh thes these are the kind { disfmarker } different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? So . And dynamos . Um { vocalsound } Marketing : Does that mean like a wind-up one ? Industrial Designer : yeah , yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } A wind-up remote . Industrial Designer : So uh I do n't know if { disfmarker } even if you want to consider this , User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they 'll they 'll { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : since uh they 'll come internally from the company , they 'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : So { vocalsound } the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones . Marketing : You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : And charging their remote , Marketing : Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that 's just { disfmarker } Project Manager : yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Yeah , it 's a good option . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } So what was what was this k ka Industrial Designer : The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking . User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : Uh yeah . Industrial Designer : But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it 'll just lie there for a long while sometimes . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . For a remote , 'cause you { disfmarker } Yeah . Industrial Designer : But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also { vocalsound } made by the company . Marketing : Yay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Environment friendly . Okay { vocalsound } um so I 'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody 's perspective . Project Manager : Yeah { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : There are different cases that can be provided . They can be { disfmarker } basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided curved and one side flat , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : and they can be curved with { disfmarker } on both the sides . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } These are the three options , right ? Um { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah , Industrial Designer : Yeah , would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : mm-hmm . Yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Mm-hmm mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : uh there were different kind of supplements available , um like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Okay . Industrial Designer : Wo wo wood . Marketing : Did you say wool ? Project Manager : Wood , wood . Marketing : Wood . Oh right . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } Not wool . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } . Project Manager : { vocalsound } A fluffy remote . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , you 'll understand why when we get to my presenta { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : Oh really ? { vocalsound } Okay . Um the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Huh . Industrial Designer : so uh we can use even um { vocalsound } a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh { vocalsound } uh some space design equipment , so it 's kind of um uh it 'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but uh it can not be used on a double curved surface . If we choose this , we can not use titanium . For for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Uh okay , the interface options now . So { vocalsound } we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Ooh . Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Sony . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , something like that . Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } So , and they have { disfmarker } they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : The scroll plus push . So this is something that has been recently developed by the company , um { vocalsound } in the last decade , so not too recent . And L_C_D_s , we can have L_C_D_s . So these two are recent and and this is q quite old . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } The various electronic options are um uh { vocalsound } so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh { disfmarker } so there 's there 's a chip behind this one , right ? The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : or a regular or advanced . And uh the price goes up as we go down , obviously . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Um { vocalsound } okay , so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Um the { disfmarker } we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels . Right ? Um { vocalsound } and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender , which is { vocalsound } { disfmarker } did not explained what i what it was , but I 'm guessing that uh { vocalsound } { disfmarker } so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker . So I 'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . Yeah , on . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Um { vocalsound } and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : So , these are the different options that we have . Okay , so { vocalsound } th that 's that 's basically { disfmarker } now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um { vocalsound } uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that , keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Excellent . Do you wan na stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , sure . Sure . Yeah . Project Manager : you can sit down , but just { disfmarker } { vocalsound } we might need you to leap up . User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay . Project Manager : What are you , PowerPoint , or { disfmarker } User Interface : Um I have some PowerPoint , yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Oh . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ? User Interface : 'Kay . Project Manager : Some sort of radiation ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : No it 's got its little camera in there , { vocalsound } plug it in { gap } . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah , it should should do it . Yeah . Marketing : 'S a Project Manager : Right , interface concept . User Interface : Okay . Um to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the { disfmarker } this talk um this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk . Project Manager : That 's fine . User Interface : So um yeah , this time um I might not have them on the slides but I { vocalsound } I can just mention them aw again . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Okay . So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it 's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which { disfmarker } uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Um um the method I { vocalsound } employed this time was { vocalsound } a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then { vocalsound } um { vocalsound } analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and { vocalsound } also um { vocalsound } whether their appearance was was pleasant . Um { vocalsound } and then um { vocalsound } this uh this um { vocalsound } this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : So some findings um { vocalsound } um . So in in the case of many user interfaces , they 're just so full of buttons that it 's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it 's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . Um { vocalsound } okay , and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . Okay , some of them are here . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Um { vocalsound } well the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , oh oh oh , { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : sorry for that . 'S go back . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } That 's nice one . User Interface : Ah , no , please . Okay , so yeah , they 're quite big and have many many buttons . Actually { vocalsound } of the { disfmarker } of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it 's it 's the smallest and and with with least { disfmarker } uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice . Marketing : Ugly . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : { vocalsound } Um okay . So let 's carry on with this . Um { disfmarker } So uh um o other findings { disfmarker } um some new things um used , uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh . { vocalsound } Our own company has developed a new in user interface { disfmarker } uh wait , no this is not the one . Okay , there is a { disfmarker } { vocalsound } we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows { disfmarker } i it 's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display . Project Manager : It 's { disfmarker } yeah . User Interface : Um s another new development is a scroll button , which was also th also already mentioned . And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed { vocalsound } a new um { vocalsound } { vocalsound } uh programmable speech uh { vocalsound } mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it 's { disfmarker } it should be . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it 's { disfmarker } once once the mm { vocalsound } um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever . Project Manager : Uh-huh , hi { vocalsound } yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : So { vocalsound } I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include . Industrial Designer : Uh sorry , uh can you go back for a second ? Um { vocalsound } uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? Uh { vocalsound } oh yeah are th Project Manager : It 's like the { disfmarker } like you said , no ? The scroll scroll wheel . Marketing : Yeah , you ca n't { disfmarker } User Interface : No no , the scroll button is a different thing . I I have a picture if you { vocalsound } { disfmarker } just a moment , I 'll { vocalsound } I 'll show you . I was n't completely sure myself , but I think it 's just like um { vocalsound } it 's it 's a wheel , it 's like not separate buttons . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah . User Interface : Look , this one here . Marketing : Oh , it 's like the iPod . User Interface : But I 'm I 'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round , Marketing : G yeah , no , you can . User Interface : it 's like you press this or this or { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh it 's the iPod uh kind of uh { disfmarker } Marketing : It 's like it 's like where you { disfmarker } you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it 's kind of like that and you spin round Project Manager : { vocalsound } Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Alright , right . Okay , okay . Marketing : and it { disfmarker } yeah . It is { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : So instead of going down you just spin { disfmarker } yeah , yeah . Marketing : You just go round Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : and it is a bit weird at first , but it 's actually very like fast . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . Marketing : I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : so it 's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Do you know , if you 're lookin if you 're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you 're looking for something at T_ , then it 's a lot faster than the wheel , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : but you 've got a lot less control over it . Industrial Designer : Right . So maybe I should include that here as well , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : L_C_D_s um plus spinning . User Interface : { vocalsound } Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : It { vocalsound } it has to be small , simple . Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . Um and I I also thought uh { vocalsound } if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . There is { vocalsound } uh I think there is no reason why we could n't use something like this for for the remote control . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : So yeah , that 's uh that 's it . Project Manager : Excellent . Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Okay , I 've put the copy of the presentation in um the { disfmarker } Project Manager : The project documents . Marketing : yeah . Project Manager : Excellent . If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Cool . Project Manager : Here it comes . Okay . Marketing : Fabulous . Okay , cool . Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gon na be wanting in the the near future . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Okay . Right . Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect . So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Um , you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : And um , yeah it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : So um { vocalsound } uh maybe uh as you 're discussing things , is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here ? Marketing : So { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , yeah , sure . Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . So mm uh so it { vocalsound } Project Manager : That 's over on the interface , Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } yeah , Project Manager : if if you could put { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ? Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Um and an Project Manager : And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : yeah . Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ , Project Manager : so that means we need an advanced thing . Industrial Designer : I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who 's pressing buttons , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Depends how fast your television runs , really , do n't do n't you think ? I mean we 've got one of those um Telewest boxes Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait , and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time . And if you get the number in wrong , then it 's a bit of a pain , Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Right . { gap } Marketing : so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you do n't interrupt the picture on the screen , Marketing : You know ? Yeah . Project Manager : so if you 're watching something { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : That 's true , yeah , that 's also { disfmarker } Marketing : And i it would be like { disfmarker } I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what 's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen 's protected so it does n't actually get scratched . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that Industrial Designer : Mm right . Marketing : and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , Project Manager : And then you can flip it open . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : yeah . Industrial Designer : So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , I think so . Marketing : Yeah , so that kind of decides your whole chip thing . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : You you agree ? Maarika , yeah ? User Interface : Yep , yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Right . Industrial Designer : So L_C_D_s , yeah , definitely . Marketing : Okay ? Industrial Designer : Go on . Marketing : Cool . Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Sorry , I discovered clip art . { vocalsound } Um so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture . So I mean , I 'm taking this to mean , you know , curviness . Do you know ? 'Cause you do n't tend to get flat vegetables . You know ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : and possibly even uneven , Marketing : Yeah , bit of asymmetry and stuff . Project Manager : like not not symmet yeah . Marketing : But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there , Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : because { disfmarker } I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : so you wan na { disfmarker } you curve it so that it 's suitable for use with the right hand . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Um yeah Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : , I 'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy . { vocalsound } Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Something a bit squishy and { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , Industrial Designer : Yeah , we we have Marketing : but I mean y you have to { disfmarker } User Interface : So it could be like a rubbery { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : we have rubber , User Interface : { vocalsound } yeah , uh-huh . Industrial Designer : but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the { disfmarker } um with using { disfmarker } Marketing : Well I suppose you would n't get a remote uh { disfmarker } an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah , and it 'd help if you drop it , it protects it as well . Marketing : Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : To some degree . Industrial Designer : So if if we use uh latex cases , they wo n't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint , Project Manager : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : so um we could use { vocalsound } titanium , wood or plastic uh or uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other um power things . Industrial Designer : Yeah , w energy source . Marketing : If it 's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , Project Manager : { vocalsound } From { vocalsound } from bouncing it . Marketing : you could just { vocalsound } bounce it up and down { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , tap it on the desk , yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : You can have it as like a little ball to bounce , that flips open . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Um so yeah , um okay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . So probably double curved surface is the way to go , yeah , { gap } . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : Mm yeah . Industrial Designer : Or or curved at one end and flat on the top , because I I 'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera . Um { disfmarker } Marketing : You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , you know , it 's like how you put your hands so y it 's the least movement basically . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ? Project Manager : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : It uh { disfmarker } Marketing : No , I d I do n't think it makes a lot of difference . I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight , Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : but it 's curvy , so . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Uh I think uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , 'cause the { disfmarker } Marketing : Besides , you have four sides to a thing , so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ? Industrial Designer : Right . Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh Project Manager : Dunno . Industrial Designer : because um { vocalsound } according to the information that I have , I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is { disfmarker } are these three . Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : It does not say anything about uh whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all . Project Manager : Nothing to { vocalsound } open them . Marketing : Yeah . Uh it 's it 's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from . Industrial Designer : Right , yeah , yeah . Marketing : But no , my research did n't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : 'cause I had nothing better to do with my time . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Right . Okay . Marketing : Okay , cool . Project Manager : Anything else ? What 've we got ? Marketing : Uh combine style with a level of functionality , um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function . Industrial Designer : Cool , thanks . Project Manager : Okay , so . Marketing : Okay ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Thanks 
Query : What did Industrial Designer think of the scroll wheel when presenting the user interface ? Industrial Designer : Uh sorry , uh can you go back for a second ? Um { vocalsound } uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? Uh { vocalsound } oh yeah are th Project Manager : It 's like the { disfmarker } like you said , no ? The scroll scroll wheel . Marketing : Yeah , you ca n't { disfmarker } User Interface : No no , the scroll button is a different thing . I I have a picture if you { vocalsound } { disfmarker } just a moment , I 'll { vocalsound } I 'll show you . I was n't completely sure myself , but I think it 's just like um { vocalsound } it 's it 's a wheel , it 's like not separate buttons . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah . User Interface : Look , this one here . Marketing : Oh , it 's like the iPod . User Interface : But I 'm I 'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round , Marketing : G yeah , no , you can . User Interface : it 's like you press this or this or { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh it 's the iPod uh kind of uh { disfmarker } Marketing : It 's like it 's like where you { disfmarker } you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it 's kind of like that and you spin round Project Manager : { vocalsound } Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Alright , right . Okay , okay . Marketing : and it { disfmarker } yeah . It is { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : So instead of going down you just spin { disfmarker } yeah , yeah . Marketing : You just go round Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : and it is a bit weird at first , but it 's actually very like fast . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . Marketing : I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : so it 's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Do you know , if you 're lookin if you 're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you 're looking for something at T_ , then it 's a lot faster than the wheel , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : but you 've got a lot less control over it . Industrial Designer : Right . So maybe I should include that here as well , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : L_C_D_s um plus spinning . 
Query : Why did the Marketing think they should have LCD when presenting the market trends ? Industrial Designer : I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who 's pressing buttons , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ?

Industrial Designer : So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , I think so . Marketing : Yeah , so that kind of decides your whole chip thing . 
Query : Summarize the decision discussion about key remote control concepts . Project Manager : Looking at what we 've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Let 's let 's try to r rub off things and { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , rub off some of those . Industrial Designer : yeah , so um { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : hand dynamos are definitely out , right ? { vocalsound } You you got a wind { gap } dynamo , yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , User Interface : Yeah uh-hum yeah . Project Manager : it 's not { disfmarker } that 's not streamlined and sexy , { vocalsound } having a having a wind up . Industrial Designer : Okay . Um { vocalsound } kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal , Project Manager : I think tha Industrial Designer : but uh { vocalsound } it 's { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } It 's about the practicality of it really , is n't it ? You know ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , Marketing : I mean if { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Depends how much how much movement it really needs . Industrial Designer : Kinetic energy it needs { disfmarker } I do n't have too much technical information on that , Project Manager : Pr presumably if they 're suggesting it , then we could use it . Industrial Designer : yeah , right . Okay , let 's keep it option uh keep an option , Project Manager : I 'd I 'd keep it on . Industrial Designer : yeah . Um { vocalsound } the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , right ? It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah . Project Manager : We do n't want that User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah Project Manager : it 's no { disfmarker } it 's not not vegetable . User Interface : it 's { disfmarker } yeah . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Um { vocalsound } okay , we still have all all the options . Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : N wood is { disfmarker } I ca n't n { vocalsound } how do you uh I mean you ca n't keep it really small uh Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : you ca n't make it like thin and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : I ca n't imagine a m wooden remote control . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : The wood thing . Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , so I mean if the case { disfmarker } you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky Industrial Designer : Yeah { vocalsound } if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it 's likely to break , User Interface : wi mm-mm yeah . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : it 's it 's much more uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , and given that we 're we 're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : U yeah wood is not really { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Well it 's not very cleanable either , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } That 's true . Marketing : do you know . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : It 's it 's not { vocalsound } a practical { disfmarker } I mean it 's it 's alright for a table , but for a remote control , you know . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : And splinters and stuff and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : okay { vocalsound } wood is out . Marketing : It just m does n't make any sense , I think is the thing with wood . Industrial Designer : Right . User Interface : Yeah , yeah , in the case of remote control not really . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay , now for the really interesting stuff , the interface . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right , so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : but uh it seems to be { vocalsound } out of trend , you know , nobody seems to be { disfmarker } Marketing : You have to have some push-buttons , do n't you ? User Interface : Yeah , but you { disfmarker } um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , would n't you ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Mm right . Marketing : G yeah , yeah . User Interface : Yeah , so for channel numbers but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Oh , if if we have L_C_D_ displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display . User Interface : But I th yeah but { vocalsound } I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of { disfmarker } yeah , it 's faster Project Manager : Just for fast { disfmarker } User Interface : with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um { vocalsound } discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : but if you do want to use L_C_D_ , then you flip it open , Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : but it 's it it 's more time-consuming . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven . Industrial Designer : Mm right . Project Manager : And it { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : yeah { vocalsound } L_ { disfmarker } L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options . Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ? Or do we have just uh channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ? User Interface : { vocalsound } No , no , I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers , Industrial Designer : The numbers . User Interface : because it 's { disfmarker } uh otherwise people do n't want to flip through all the channels . Um { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_ ? Industrial Designer : Or { vocalsound } on the L_C_D_ we can , you know { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : G yeah , User Interface : Yeah , I would say buttons , Marketing : I would think buttons , yeah . Project Manager : Buttons . User Interface : because it 's { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay . Marketing : It 's it 's the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : So mm { disfmarker } Marketing : I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , User Interface : I Project Manager : Mm . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and { disfmarker } they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : but , you know , I mean most of the time { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : I mean there 's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_ , I think is the the the issue there . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay , so buttons definitely in but { disfmarker } oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um { disfmarker } Project Manager : I think that 's what { vocalsound } you guys are gon na do next , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Uh okay . Project Manager : so if we put down the key um { vocalsound } things that we want . Industrial Designer : Okay , okay , so the components . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right , so uh what about the the scrolling uh ? User Interface : Yeah but n I I 'm not completely um completely clear uh I { vocalsound } yeah , about the spinning wheel . So I think it { vocalsound } it does n't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing , Marketing : { vocalsound } E either or { disfmarker } User Interface : it 's uh { disfmarker } you can al include everything in the spinning if you Marketing : G yeah . Project Manager : Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say . User Interface : { disfmarker } yeah , yeah , Marketing : { vocalsound } I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel , User Interface : in that case . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : so you have to decide whether { disfmarker } you you know , you want to be going so fast or not . But I mean the the thing with this whole { disfmarker } if y you 're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it 's spongy , then I 'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : Mm um { disfmarker } Project Manager : But if you 've got a { disfmarker } if if you 've got a flipped thing , effectively it 's something that 's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . User Interface : Ah , but I mean you can { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side . Project Manager : Th { vocalsound } that would be on one side , uh-huh . Industrial Designer : I 'm not sure it 'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . { vocalsound } Uh i it { disfmarker } Project Manager : No , I think it 's just the casing rubber on the outside . User Interface : Yeah , I um I think so too , I mean the case would be { disfmarker } Marketing : You want an outside of rubber User Interface : yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons , Marketing : and then open it up and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber or something like that . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : rubber buttons , but then { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Or maybe like interchangeable cases . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : 'Cause I know like we 're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel , but I have like a { disfmarker } { vocalsound } you know , obviously my iPod 's not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it Industrial Designer : Right , right . Marketing : and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Right , Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : okay , so so that gives us a more trendy look as well . Um { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now . Industrial Designer : Right . Yeah , and uh we 're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , right ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 's right , Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : that 's what they 're after . Industrial Designer : So I 'll rub that out . { vocalsound } And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than { disfmarker } Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Yeah I think we { disfmarker } um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or { disfmarker } Marketing : That does n't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though . Project Manager : I guess . User Interface : Yeah , does { disfmarker } Project Manager : Bananas . { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . Banana 's yellow , { vocalsound } yeah , definitely . Marketing : Yeah , but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote { vocalsound } the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? So you could have like { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple Project Manager : Green . Yeah . Marketing : and that and then you 'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay . Um { vocalsound } okay , if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits . Uh since we 're having L_C_D_s there there 's no way that we 're will be able to { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } We need the advanced { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : so { vocalsound } it seems to be one area where we would want to spend . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So I 'll rub off the other two . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So are we discounting solar energy because rubber 's gon na be used in there somewhere or { disfmarker } Project Manager : That was the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Oh is { disfmarker } oh the constraint was uh { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } If { disfmarker } Project Manager : We ca n't have solar panels with rubber , so . Industrial Designer : yeah . Marketing : solar panels with the rubber . Industrial Designer : Yeah . So { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , okay , so we lose that I think . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Shall we go for { disfmarker } if we 're going for rubber , we think uh on { disfmarker } as our case , and then { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } And the buttons as well , I think . Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I think uh { vocalsound } Project Manager : We 've got five more minutes . Industrial Designer : we 'll have uh { vocalsound } { disfmarker } uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , a although it does seem uh interesting . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : But it does not hold any advantages as such for a { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : It 's just a gimmick . Project Manager : Yeah , Industrial Designer : yeah . Project Manager : mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Okay . Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Yeah . I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I 'd put them in , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Ye yeah , { vocalsound } we we do n't have too much information about it , um { disfmarker } Project Manager : but if it 's { disfmarker } Yeah . User Interface : Yeah , but it it { disfmarker } I think it should be quite cheap because it 's from our own company , yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } It 's from the company , so { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Okay . And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it 's flipped into each other . Industrial Designer : Flat on the top . Yeah . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : Can I pull the { vocalsound } thing out the back of your computer ? Marketing : Yeah , sure j Project Manager : Just so we can { disfmarker } Marketing : Sorry , do you want me to { disfmarker } Project Manager : Nothing , it 's right , I 'm just { disfmarker } There we go . Marketing : What does um I_C_S_ mean ? Industrial Designer : I_C_s ? Uh integrated circuits . Marketing : Okay , cool . So it 's advanced integrated circuits ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Uh oh now I 've gone too far . Industrial Designer : Uh um we we 're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . We 're on our way . Okay . { vocalsound } So we 've basically worked out that we 're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber Industrial Designer : Yep . Project Manager : and the buttons are also rubber . We 're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we 're incorporating voice recognition . That 's our overall concept , User Interface : { vocalsound } Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : and it 's gon na look sort of vegetable , Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } and be in bright vegetable colours . User Interface : Uh-huh . So { vocalsound } w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer { disfmarker } Marketing : Imagine it would be inside . Project Manager : I think it 's on the { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay . Marketing : So um actually that could like really cut down your thing , Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : so you 've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you 've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Yeah , okay . Marketing : Um so you 've still not got like a lot of stuff in the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-mm . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : You 've maybe got , you know { disfmarker } { vocalsound } like if you 're modelling on iPod you 've got five buttons and a wheel , Project Manager : On the { disfmarker } Mm-hmm . Marketing : and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one 's the little bit inside the wheel , Project Manager : In the centre , Marketing : yeah . Project Manager : yeah , sure . User Interface : Mm yeah . Project Manager : Okay , so now we 've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gon na work on the look and feel design , Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : which I 'll presume he 'll work out what that means . Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we 've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Cool . Project Manager : Is that all okay ? And anyone who has n't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so { disfmarker } in case we have to refer to it . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , okay . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Cool , I 'm gon na go and sit on my own . Project Manager : Y ah nobody wants to talk to you . Marketing : { vocalsound } I know , I 'm hated . Project Manager : Unplug yourself . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Hmm . { vocalsound } Marketing : I 've got a bit tangled up in all this { vocalsound } User Interface : So but { disfmarker } shall I move away first or shall I stay here with { disfmarker } Project Manager : I dunno , maybe I would car User Interface : we need to { disfmarker } 
Query : What did the group think of the wood case when discussing the key remote control concepts ? Industrial Designer : Um { vocalsound } okay , we still have all all the options . Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : N wood is { disfmarker } I ca n't n { vocalsound } how do you uh I mean you ca n't keep it really small uh Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : you ca n't make it like thin and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : I ca n't imagine a m wooden remote control . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : The wood thing . Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , so I mean if the case { disfmarker } you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky Industrial Designer : Yeah { vocalsound } if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it 's likely to break , User Interface : wi mm-mm yeah . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : it 's it 's much more uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , and given that we 're we 're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah .

Marketing : And splinters and stuff and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : okay { vocalsound } wood is out . Marketing : It just m does n't make any sense , I think is the thing with wood . Industrial Designer : Right . User Interface : Yeah , yeah , in the case of remote control not really . 
Query : Why did the group think of the push-buttons when discussing the key remote control concepts ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay , now for the really interesting stuff , the interface . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right , so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry , Project Manager : Yeah .

Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Lynne Neagle AM : Good morning , everyone . Welcome to the Children , Young People and Education Committee . We 've received apologies for absence from Suzy Davies , and I 'm very pleased to welcome Angela Burns , who is substituting for Suzy this morning . We 've also received apologies from Dawn Bowden . Can I also welcome Siân Gwenllian to the meeting ? Siân is joining us from her constituency office via video-conference . Can I ask Members if they 've got any declarations of interest , please ? Hefin . Hefin David AM : Apologies . I 'm currently registered as an associate lecturer at Cardiff Metropolitan University , although I have n't done any work for them for some time . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay . Thank you very much . We 'll move on , then , to item 2 this morning , which is our evidence session on the higher education new academic year allocations . I 'm very pleased to welcome David Blaney , who is chief executive of the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales , and Bethan Owen , who is deputy chief executive of HEFCW . Thank you , both , for attending this morning . We 're looking forward to hearing what you 've got to say . If you 're happy , we 'll go straight into questions from Members , and the first questions are from Angela Burns . Angela Burns AM : Good morning . Thank you very much , indeed . I just wanted to talk about , really , the financial sustainability of the higher education sector because , as we know , there 's been all sorts of things going on in the press . So , can I just start with , actually , quite a technical question and ask you what the financial indicators look like for the universities here in Wales , and are there particular indicators that are really flashing warning signals to you ? Dr David Blaney : Well , shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail ? It 's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities . They result from three main causes : one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds , which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK . There are increased pension costs and , actually , increased costs generally . And , of course , we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England , and whether that might play into Wales , and also Brexit . These challenges are not unique to Wales ; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another . So , this is not a Welsh issue . Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales , there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales , and even now , that 's still the case . So , Welsh higher education institutions are approximately £40 million worse off than they would be in the English system . That 's a challenge , and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students , and that 's fine . The money 's gone into the system but it has n't gone into universities , necessarily . So , these are serious challenges for institutions to manage , but I think it is a managed situation . We 're not seeing a crisis ; we are seeing some real challenges , and there is a distinction , I think , between— . We have to understand , though , that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity . Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately , but there 's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales . They are taking out capacity ; they 're not cutting at fat now , they 're cutting out core capacity . And so , the range of the curriculum , the range of research and innovation , the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that . And against that backdrop , the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important—delivery of that is going to be really important—and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that . The Diamond money is coming in . This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource , through us , to higher education . And the projections in future years are better still , and that will be extremely important . The performance of the sector is very good ; we had the national student survey results out yesterday . Wales is still the best in the UK , which is excellent . We have the best impact from research in Wales across the UK . So , all of that is very positive , but that is also being done at some cost . There are some very tired staff in universities , and we 've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well . Angela Burns AM : Can I bring you back to the financial element of that ? Can I just ask a question : what are the university reserves looking like at present ? Dr David Blaney : Here , I refer to my learned friend . Bethan Owen : The reserves are a measure . There 's a difference between the distributable reserves—I do n't have those numbers before me , but looking at reserves , what is more important are those reserves that are available as cash or liquid cash . So , universities have reserves , but a large amount of that is tied up in their estates , so they 're not immediately realisable . So , one of the key measures that we 're looking at , which is even more important than surpluses and deficit , is the operating cash that our universities are generating at the moment . When we look at operating cash in 2017-18 , they were generating , as a percentage of income , about 7.6 per cent , which contrasts with nearly 10 per cent for the same year for English institutions . And that represents their capacity to generate surplus cash to meet their costs , which now , increasingly , include the costs of servicing their borrowings . So , again , because capital funding has not been as available to universities as it was , they 've invested in their estates and that 's largely been funded by borrowings . The costs of those borrowings have to be met on an annual basis , so that 's becoming an increasing proportion of the operating cash that universities have . Angela Burns AM : I just asked that question because I know that about four years ago , the universities were sitting on substantial reserves and were less than keen to deploy them back into actually using them for the students—it was more about building up the war chest , if you like , of the universities . And I just really wanted to have an understanding of how that picture might have changed over the last four years and are they actually skinnier cats now , rather than before . Bethan Owen : We can get you that analysis , but even four years ago , I think the definition of exactly what 's meant by reserves , it 's really important to look at what are distributable reserves as opposed to the assets that universities have . Angela Burns AM : Yes , I do understand the difference . Bethan Owen : And , there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates . So , for example , Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing , which you draw down as you 're spending . So , in the short term , the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances , but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and , over the next two or three years , will be utilised for that . Angela Burns AM : So , overall , you 're painting a picture of a sector that 's under a significant degree of financial stress , and this is obviously using your key financial indicators . Do you monitor each and every university , or do you wait for them to come back and tell you what their situation is ? Bethan Owen : We monitor , we receive forecasts , five-year forecasts , and we meet frequently with all our universities now . It varies , depending on the risks of the universities , as to how frequently we meet , but we 're actually meeting with every university because even the forecast that we received last July , the changes , even in the 12-month period , are significant enough for us to need a better understanding of what the latest position is . The forecasts , if I just run through— . We had a sector that , in 2017-18 , had a deficit . Although it had a turnover and income of £1.5 billion , which had increased , nonetheless it had a small deficit of 0.4 per cent of income in 2017-18 , which was an improvement on the deficit the year before of 1.7 per cent , but notably , again , the sector in England were looking at surpluses of 3 per cent to 4 per cent in the same period . The forecasts that we had this time last year were indicating that , for 2018-19 , we should have a sector that 's roughly in a break-even position , but that has to be caveated with waiting for new forecasts in July , where there will have to be a reflection of the pension costs , and there have been significant changes in pension costs , both for the teachers ' pension scheme and the universities ' superannuation scheme as well , and those will be significant costs that universities have to build into their forecasts at a time when their income , certainly their fee income , is not increasing , and that is the challenge . Angela Burns AM : Are we going to lose any universities in the next couple of years ? Dr David Blaney : I do n't think so . As I said earlier on , we 're not seeing a crisis , we 're seeing really challenging circumstances for institutions to manage . At the moment , our sense is they are managing them , so one of the things we try to do is to make sure that , insofar as we can see it , we are making sure that the institutions are alert to the challenges they 're facing , and are actually engaging those challenges properly , and we are seeing that at the moment . So I think what we will see if the pressure continues unabated is more costs being taken out , so more jobs being lost , more capacity being lost , but that 's not the same as falling over . I do n't see people falling over . There is always the possibility of structural change within the sector , and that might be one of the solutions that institutions think about , but it 's not a policy position , and it 's not always a good short-term response to crisis anyway , actually . But I think , as I say , we 're in a managed situation , but the challenges are quite acute . But I do n't see an institution falling over in the foreseeable future . Angela Burns AM : When you talk about structural change , are you referring to the fact that certain offshoots or divisions might close ? I bring this up because I 'm the Assembly Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire , and I have had multiple representations from students , and their parents , who are about to go to Lampeter and who 've been told that courses are being restructured , there 's a massive staff loss , and they have concerns about whether the three-year commitment they 're about to make to a course is going to be able to be sustained . So I am trying to drill down a little bit , because I think it 's only fair for the students to know what they 're up against , and also it 's a bit like in the great depression—you can start a run on something , ca n't you ? Because if enough people believe it , then suddenly enough people will stop going to what is an excellent little university , really top-quality in medieval literature , in archaeology . And I 'm just talking about one , but I know there are problems in other universities around Wales , so I just wondered if you could comment on that and also what processes you as HEFCW might have in place to protect any student who does find themselves in a situation where their course appears to be disappearing before their eyes . Dr David Blaney : So , there 's quite a lot in that question , actually . Let me try not to forget any of the elements . First of all , your comment about causing a run is a serious consideration . So , if we look at the debate that happened in the Senedd last week , from my reading of the transcript , it was actually quite a balanced debate where pretty much every contributor made reference to the contribution that higher education is making . There was reference to the national student survey scores , and in many ways Wales is the best place in the UK to come and be a student , because you are looked after properly in Wales . But there was also a perfectly legitimate exploration of whether or not there 's a crisis , and if you look at the way in which that was represented in the media , the crisis bit stuck and the rest of it did n't . At the point where the sector is trying very hard to recruit students , it 's really quite unhelpful that you get that sort of representation . So we do need to make sure , I think , all of us , that we try to avoid a situation where there can be media amplification of a problem that 's not actually as acute as the media are portraying it , and that is very harsh . I 'm not being critical of the political process here , but it has ripples and we do need to be careful that we do n't start a run on this . In terms of the specifics at Lampeter , we understand that there are no plans to close any of the departments , and there certainly will not be plans to pull the rug out from under continuing students . That is just not what institutions do . So there 's an absolute obligation on them to meet their commitments , and that 's a contractual obligation anyway , so it 's a legal obligation . But we also have a quality machinery that we operate where we would expect institutions to be able to demonstrate that they 've put in place appropriate arrangements to ensure that students can finish their programmes of study . So they 're not going to be recruiting students to programmes that they 're not planning to continue—they just are not going to do that . And if you think about it in a market context , it would be suicidal for a university to treat their students like that . Angela Burns AM : But I have to ask these questions because the auditor was very clear that there was a material uncertainty in Trinity Saint David 's financial plans . Dr David Blaney : Yes , I understand that , so let ’ s come back to the material uncertainty . [ Interruption . ] No , I understand , and that 's fine . What I 'm hoping to try and express is that we have absolute confidence that the institutions will not do the dirty on their students . They will look after their students and if they 're recruiting to programmes , they are recruiting to programmes that they are planning to run , and run through to completion . And the expectations that we place on them in terms of our quality assurance machinery is precisely that—when they are engaged in portfolio change , they have to look after the interest of the students that they currently have . In terms of our oversight and monitoring , our primary consideration , again , is the interest of the students . They are the people who have , in many ways , least influence over what happens in terms of the way an institution is managed . Although , they do have a voice and , actually , the arrangements for the student voice in Wales are , again , better than elsewhere in the UK . But , nonetheless , we do not wish to see students becoming innocent victims of difficulties of management and financing . And so that is our primary consideration when we 're looking at these institutions . Our institutional risk review process is fundamentally designed to make sure that institutions are grappling with their problems before they become a crisis . So , we have machinery , which has 70/80 different factors and hundreds of questions that we ask twice a year , to interrogate the performance of the institutions and to make sure that we are seeing them managing the issues that they 're facing . So , it 's not the challenges you face , it 's the way you face your challenges—it 's a cliché—and , at the moment , they are managing them , but if we were in any way concerned that they were n't , the people who are most at risk in that context are the students and we will be intervening to make sure that they were cited , and we do intervene when we have to . Angela Burns AM : Well , following on from what you said , I 've just got two really specific technical questions , then , to ask , because you said that you look across the whole scope to make sure that they are meeting all of their correct liquidity ratios and so on . So , considering how much is invested in their estates , are you happy that each university 's estates strategy and its financing is prudent and has appropriate governing-body oversight in place ? Dr David Blaney : Yes , so the estates strategies that institutions operate are overseen by either the full governing body or relevant sub-committees in respect of every institution , so there is proper governance oversight . And in all of those instances , there is staff and student engagement as well in the strategic approach on estates . So , the machinery is in place— Angela Burns AM : Because it 's the big thing that drives most of university borrowing , is n't it ? Dr David Blaney : Indeed , it is . Angela Burns AM : So , if our universities are on a sticky wicket , we just need to know that the borrowing that they 're undertaking is absolutely prudently assessed and is appropriate . So , as long as you 're content , if I can hear you say that— [ Laughter . ] Dr David Blaney : Okay . We 're content on two fronts : one is that the governance machinery within the institutions is structured appropriately to look at that , but also that if the institutions are wanting to engage in anything other than relatively trivial borrowing , they have to get our consent as well . And what we do n't do is second-guess everything , but what we do do is make sure that the governing body , or its relevant committees , have been asking the right questions . So , there are two bits to this . Angela Burns AM : And then—sorry . Bethan Owen : Can I just add to that , then ? Angela Burns AM : Yes , of course . Bethan Owen : In asking for the forecasts , we have reinforced this year the importance of universities looking at different scenarios . So , to be looking at the demographic and maybe in the past , where there 's potentially been growth in the system and universities have built that into their forecast , we have explicitly asked this year that we are provided—not just the governing body—with the scenario where there is no growth in the income . That 's not the core forecast , but a scenario , so that it 's quite clear how reliant the forecasts are on that growth , and if that growth does n't come through , what the contingency plans are for ensuring that all the cost commitments can be met . And we should probably just differentiate between—we have a role before borrowings are entered into , but all the best forecasts in the world can never quite predict , certainly what 's happened in the last two years , probably , in universities . So , there are significant borrowings that are now committed to and the key measures we are looking at are universities ' capacity to meet their covenants and their repayments under those borrowings , because that 's essential for maintaining their liquidity . Angela Burns AM : Which actually , neatly , thank you , brings me to my last question , which is : have any universities broken those loan covenants or been close to breaking them , unable to pay their borrowings as and when they fall due ? Bethan Owen : There was a significant change in accounting standards in 2015 , financial reporting standard 102 , so most universities had to renegotiate their covenants , but it was because the accounts were looking very different . The accounting standards brought about changes in how income was recognised and how some service concession arrangements , largely student accommodation arrangements , and pension costs , significantly , were recognised in the accounts . So , most universities have had to renegotiate covenants , but we 're not aware of any who 've had to renegotiate due to covenant breaches , other than one which the University of Wales Trinity Saint David disclosed in their financial statements—that they did need to renegotiate their financing arrangements , which they have done earlier this year , and they have now negotiated new covenants . It 's a core part of financial management in universities now that you manage your relationship with your lender as well as with us . Breaching covenants in themselves is different to doing that with your lender being unaware and the factors being within your control . So , again , from that perspective , we have the covenants built into our forecasts , we require the forecasts to show how the university are planning to be within their covenants . The nature of those covenants vary , but most of them require a measure of cash flow , a ratio between the cash generated and the cost of debt , so there is close monitoring that is required because of the borrowing in the system , as well as our ongoing monitoring as well . Angela Burns AM : Thank you , Bethan . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . Just before we move on to Hefin David , can I just ask you what your view , then , is on the statement included by auditors in the accounts of Trinity Saint David that there is material uncertainty ? Bethan Owen : Yes , I 'll pick up on that . The material uncertainty largely relates—there is a note in the accounts that explains the factors that are being taken into account , but it largely relates to some significant cash receipts that have been subject to timing delays and the fact that the timing of these is essentially outside the control of the institution . The main delay relates to the receipt of funding for the Egin project , which was due to be received from the Swansea city deal . That funding has been delayed , but the sums due to the university are still due to the university—it 's the issue of the timing of those receipts that is causing a cash pressure . Receipt of that funding would certainly reduce the cash flow pressure at the university at the moment . Just in terms of cash flows , all universities have to ensure that they are maintaining enough cash in their system to meet their payments as they fall due . Most of their costs are incurred on a monthly basis , staff costs in particular , but the income flows into universities are now less regular . In days gone by , that funding would largely flow from us and that would also come on a monthly basis . The funding from the Student Loans Company now , for example , comes in chunks . A quarter of that money comes in in October , a quarter in February , and the majority of it , half of it , does n't come into the university in cash until May . So , that 's quite a different cash management scenario for universities to manage ; it requires holding cash balances to do it . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . Just before I bring Hefin in , we 're going to need to have a bit of agility , as Dai Lloyd would call it , in our questioning and our answers if we 're going to cover the ground that we need to cover . So , Hefin . Hefin David AM : How can we be assured that governance arrangements across the eight institutions are sufficiently rigorous but also consistent ? Dr David Blaney : So , the first point to make , of course , is that universities are autonomous , as you know— Hefin David AM : I 've just written 'independent and autonomous ' . Dr David Blaney : Yes , all of that . And they are charities and so on , so they have expectations in respect of that in any case . The university governing body obviously is an important part of the machinery , particularly in terms of generating constructive challenge for the executive within universities . The governing bodies all are expected to behave in a way that is consistent with the guidance produced by the Committee of University Chairs , the CUC guide , which identifies good practice . So , it ’ s a higher education code of governance and all Welsh universities work to that code . That code is itself up for review at the moment . So , that is an opportunity for that to be strengthened . Just in terms of governing bodies , it 's also important that governing bodies engage in a process of continual refreshing , because that gives you a greater variety of perspectives , which is important . But it ’ s also important they have people who understand the higher education business as well as from other contexts . Getting that mix right is important . As it happens at the moment , there are also issues about ethnicity and gender balance . Half the chairs of Welsh university governing bodies are female . Half the vice-chancellors are female . That ’ s a positive position for Wales to be in . But I think our view would be that when you get an increase in the contextual pressures that we ’ ve been discussing already this morning , the role of the governing body actually becomes even more significant . So , we have encouraged the sector , both the chairmen of the university councils , but also the vice-chancellors , to engage in a process of an independent review of governance in Wales . We ’ ll be alongside that . We ’ ll be supporting that . But , actually , it ’ s important that they own it . And it hasn ’ t been hard for us to encourage that—they have been keen to take this opportunity to take stock . The Welsh higher education system is part of a UK system—they don ’ t want to be a million miles away from the rest of the UK in terms of expectations , but there is scope in Wales , given the scale of the sector , to actually construct something that is more challenging , I think , in terms of expectations , than might be the common denominator across the UK , and maybe some more exemplification . Importantly , in this exercise , we are not just interested in governance process . It ’ s going to be quite hard to do this , but I ’ m very keen that we engage—and the sector are up for this—in governance culture , because , actually , you can do process checks and you ’ ll have the right structure of committees and have the right sort of papers going , but , in the end , it ’ s the dynamic within that room and who ’ s asking which questions and how well informed they are , and whether it 's an open culture or is it a defensive culture—these are really what influences the quality of decision making . Hefin David AM : And how different are those cultures across institutions ? Dr David Blaney : I think it ’ s very hard to say . We don ’ t sit in the governing bodies of those institutions . Very occasionally we get to observe one . Typically , that ’ s at a point where there are sufficient difficulties going on that we feel that we need to— Hefin David AM : Do you have the option to observe at any point ? Dr David Blaney : We ca n't insist , I do n't think . Bethan Owen : We can ask to . Dr David Blaney : We can ask . But in the main , actually , our presence would change the dynamic of that anyway , so I 'm not sure that 's necessarily helpful . But we are keen to see what we can achieve with the sector in addressing these issues of what constitutes constructive challenge . Hefin David AM : I take from that that there might be different approaches in different institutions . Is your aim to see consistency in the same approaches , then ? Dr David Blaney : I think we ’ d like to see a consistent minimum set of expectations . I think there are differences , because there are people involved . In the end , it ’ s about personalities , it ’ s about people ’ s background and it ’ s about their knowledge . And we have a role to play in this as well , so we have a toolkit that we produce for governors , which , essentially , is a set of information that locates their university in the context of the UK , across a number of factors . So , if they had been told something that is not perhaps as true as it might be by the executive , they can see that in the data . Whether that toolkit needs a refresh—I ’ m sure it probably does , it ’ s been there for a while now— . So , part of that is what information we can provide to help governing bodies be properly informed as well . Hefin David AM : Yes , and this is the independence and autonomy thing . This is quite distant from Government—unlike other institutions , where you can prescribe some of these approaches . Dr David Blaney : Yes , and in the end I do n't think there 's any pushback from the sector in terms of wanting to operate in accordance with best practice . Hefin David AM : Yes , and I totally defend independence and autonomy . Dr David Blaney : Absolutely . The challenge is all of us being clear what constitutes best practice . Hefin David AM : So , what about risk appetite ? Do you feel that any governing bodies are exhibiting what might be considered to be an imprudent risk appetite ? Dr David Blaney : I do n't think so , and this manifests itself in two ways . So , we would see this coming through in forecasts , and we would see it coming through in requests for borrowings , predominantly . Actually , we 'd see it in other ways as well . Our links into institutions are many and various , and we have our formal stuff , but we all have links into institutions that are informal and we— . One of the beauties of the scale of the sector in Wales is we can see the institutions in a way that they ca n't hope to in England . It 's just completely different . And so we would see it in other ways . But we have , in some instances , I think it 's fair to say , helped institutions to think again about some of their aspirations . So , where we 've seen things and we think , 'That just looks ridiculously optimistic , ' we 've just asked the questions . We do n't say , 'No , you ca n't do that , ' because they are autonomous , they make the decisions , but we try to make sure that they 're asking the right questions . Hefin David AM : So , would you see that governing bodies are falling short in doing that themselves , in that , where they become strategic decisions that require due diligence , are the governing bodies themselves presenting that challenge ? Or the fact you 've just said that , does that suggest to us that , actually , they are falling short ? Dr David Blaney : I think there 's a mixture of things going on . We have a slightly different perspective and we have a perspective that is very intimately informed in terms of how the institution is performing . So , you have a governing body with a range of perspectives , and you will also have people who are very committed and very enthusiastic about the institution , and just occasionally it 's helpful to get a slightly external perspective on these things . So , I do n't think it 's a shortfall as such , but I just think— Hefin David AM : The kind of honest broker role , kind of . Dr David Blaney : The machinery depends on having a body like HEFCW doing some of that role , and the people who lend money to institutions are absolutely clear about that . So , we have relationships with the banks ; they come and see us every now and again—typically not to talk about individual clients but just to talk about what we do and how we do it . Interestingly , for example , when Michael Barber got up before Christmas and said there will be no bail-outs of universities , we had banks on the phone to us within a couple of days , wanting just to talk about how it is in Wales and is it still how it used to be . So , they are very keenly aware of what we do . So , it 's not really a governance failure ; it 's just that the machinery includes us . Hefin David AM : Okay , that 's important . And one of the things , from a distance—I mean , I 've been involved in different ways in an institution , and looking at the institutions from a distance . There are people , as you say , involved , and people always make the difference in different cultures . Do you find that the relationships between executive teams and governors is effective , and are they sufficiently robust and challenging as well ? Those executive permanent staff and the governors—is there challenge there ? Dr David Blaney : I would say , in the main , yes . Occasionally , we help the governors to ask the right questions , so occasionally that external perspective we 've just discussed is helpful in that regard . Actually , there are times when there are tensions between the executive and governing bodies , inevitably—that 's not something that 's remarkable—and we can feel that as well . We have conversations with both governing bodies and executives . Hefin David AM : And that can become apparent from a public point of view as well—you know , media reports and— . Dr David Blaney : Yes , sometimes these things can spill , and the governing bodies also include student representation , staff representation , who are typically union reps , and so , you know , there are all sorts of— . I 'm not in any way saying that people are indiscreet , but there are all sorts of interests that are sitting around that table that have to be managed within a governance context . So , sometimes it can spill . And these tensions are not all-out war , but there are sometimes differences of view and they have to be worked through , and that 's governance working properly , I think . Hefin David AM : Okay , which is—some of the work you 've suggested will help towards that . Dr David Blaney : Yes . Hefin David AM : And a last question : you 've identified one university as high risk , five as medium , and two as low in the short to medium term . You 're obviously not going to tell us which , but what I 'm interested in is the direction of travel , and whether those that are 'medium'—are they at any point at risk of becoming 'high ' in the near future ? Dr David Blaney : I think it 's fair to say that the direction of travel is that we 're seeing an increased risk profile in the sector in Wales , and it 's about the financial pressures that we 've already discussed this morning . And that is why the efforts that the Minister has gone to to secure the Diamond settlement , and , indeed , other bits of money now and again , are so important . So , she 's doing what she can , and that 's really good , but we always knew that , between the point of the Diamond recommendations being made and the full implementation , there was going to be a valley to cross . The new machinery costs more as you phase out the old as well . So , the amount of funding was always going to be under pressure ; there 's a demographic dip , and there are the other contextual factors we 've discussed . We always knew there was going to be a valley . And the institutions have been working very hard to try not to take cost out now that they really do n't have to take out , because they do n't want to reduce capacity , which they 'll struggle to recover again when the financial position improves . So , they are seeing deficits , which are managed deficits , where they 're spending more than their income in order just to keep the capacity in . So , they 're being as responsible as we could expect them to be in this . Hefin David AM : And , if you 're back in a year or two 's time , the next few years , are we confident that there wo n't be more in the high-risk category ? You said you do n't see collapse , but are we confident there wo n't be more in the high-risk category ? Dr David Blaney : Well , I think what I would always say about this process is that it does n't guarantee 100 per cent accuracy . We can only go on what we can see . So , I wouldn't— . HEFCW is innately cautious as an organisation , so I 'm not going to say we 're confident , but that does n't mean to say we 're worried either . Hefin David AM : Right , okay . So , to answer my question : are we likely to see more in the high-risk category or not ? Dr David Blaney : We might . Hefin David AM : Okay . Bethan Owen : And , just to add , I think the key bit of that is maintaining the attractiveness of Welsh universities to students , because a large proportion are coming not from just Wales , but from England and internationally—so , that 's a key part—and also that our research portfolio is invested in , and that also brings economic benefits . So , I think those are the two that we are [ correction : need to be ] able to maintain : the institutions as attractive options for students , and that our research capacity is invested in . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . I 've got a supplementary from Siân Gwenllian . Sian Gwenllian AM : Just in the interest of transparency , are you able to tell us which universities are in which categories of risk ? Dr David Blaney : We do n't publish that ; we publish numbers . So , that 's , I 'm afraid , where we 're going to stick . Hefin David AM : They did n't even try to— [ Inaudible . ] [ Laughter . ] Lynne Neagle AM : Okay . Thank you . The next questions then are from Janet Finch-Saunders . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Good morning . Can you explain your overall approach to the 2019-20 allocations and what your priority for allocations has been ? Bethan Owen : We publish our funding allocations , and we published the 2019-20 allocations on 4 June . For 2019-20 , we 're allocating £149 million , and , as David said , this is the first year that we 've been able to start putting funding , additional funding , in from the Diamond recommendations for investment in the sector . So , that means we 've been able to increase our recurrent teaching funding by £7 million—not a significant amount , but it 's a start . And we have maintained QR , which is our funding for research , quality research , and postgraduate research , at least at the same levels of £76 million , as it 's been that in previous years . We 've increased part-time funding by £1 million to £26 million , and we 've started to increase support for expensive subjects—that 's medicine , dentistry and conservatoire provision—and higher cost subjects—those are the sciences and the STEM . So , we made a start on that and increased that support by about £6 million to £20 million in total . And , in addition to that , we have strategic funding that we 're maintaining for Reaching Wider projects and the Sêr Cymru project . And then , in addition to our recurrent funding , we have had strategic funding in our remit letters for the last two years . So , we 're developing programmes for civic mission , community engagement , collaborations between higher education and further education , and , more recently , we had funding at the end of March to start to implement the recommendations of Graeme Reid 's report for research investment , and also for developing mental health and well-being . That strategic funding is very welcome , but to be able to build those activities into our core funding , which we hope Diamond will bring , would be more sustainable for institutions . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you . Now , the Minister talks of one skills system . How do your allocations to the 2019-20 academic year support and incentivise collaboration between HE and FE ? Dr David Blaney : So , there are probably two dimensions to this . First of all , we have provided £3.5 million of separate funding specifically targeted to improve and increase collaboration between HE and FE . So , we put out a circular inviting proposals for that , and it was competitive , so we funded what was the best of the proposals , and we constrained it to be available only to pump-prime new activity or to add value to existing activity , but not just to keep things ticking over . We had seven bids submitted from across the three Welsh regions on a whole range of activities , which we probably have n't got time to go into now . I 've got a long list here , but , for example , in south-east Wales , the University of South Wales is leading on a bid partnering with Cardiff University , Cardiff Met , with the Open University and all the FE players in the region . So , we were really pleased , actually . We tried to get it within regions , because that 's how you get the biggest impact for learners in the area and also for smaller enterprises in terms of innovation work . So , that is a specific bit of funding designed to incentivise HE-FE collaboration . And then we direct fund a couple of FE institutions for delivery of higher education for historical reasons , and we also have our funding going through to support franchise activity between HE and FE . There are about 5,000 students who are studying HE programmes under franchise in FE colleges in Wales , and our funding method has , historically for some time now , protected that money . So , we try to prevent universities from taking the money out of franchise and onto campus , because we think it 's important to try to encourage local provision within particular localities . And , certainly in areas where public transport infrastructure is perhaps not what it might be , for people to move to universities can be quite a disincentive , so— . But we encourage it that way as well . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you . Then , finally from me , the council 's remit letter for the 2019-20 academic year from the Minister does ask you to consider how you 'd increase openness and transparency around the use of fee income . So , what are the issues here , and how will you take this forward ? Bethan Owen : The reporting of the income and expenditure is largely provided , probably more so in narrative form in the accounts and the financial statements and annual reports of institutions . A number of institutions also provide graphs and more easily accessible information to understand the income and expenditure of universities . But we would accept that this information is n't easy to access at the moment . There are examples of good practice across the sector in presenting as simply as possible what the income sources are for universities and how they spend their money . And we 're going to be working with the Welsh universities and sector bodies to improve the accessibility of that information for Welsh institutions . More transparent reporting of income and expenditure , and not just fee income , is actually very important for understanding how income cross-flows work in universities . Some reasonably simplistic analyses can assume that all the student fee just covers the direct costs of academic provision , but there 's much more to the student experience than that , so there are costs : there are the infrastructure costs , the student support costs , even the community engagement and all the research activities bring benefits to the teaching and fee provision . So , more transparency of all the universities ' income sources and expenditure and a better understanding of the income cross-flows and why you ca n't look at universities in isolation of student provision and research , you have to look at the whole—so , we 'll be working with them to improve that information . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . We 're going to go to Hefin David now for some questions on part-time student funding . Hefin David AM : Part-time student numbers are bucking the trend in Wales , as I understand it , and we are seeing a bigger increase in Wales of part-time numbers than elsewhere in the UK . How is that going to be sustainable within current arrangements ? Bethan Owen : We 've allocated £26.5 million in 2019-20 to support part-time provision , and we have been able in 2019-20 to fund some growth . So , there is growth in that funding to allow those institutions and incentivise those institutions who have recruited more students than last year to continue to do so . That came at an overall additional cost of £1.9 million , and , based on what we 're hearing from student support , we 're expecting to see that requirement increase . So , it 's one of the areas where we 'll need to look at how we prioritise Diamond funding . And at the moment , our intention—but subject to knowing the quantum of it—is to continue to support and fund growth in part-time provision . Hefin David AM : So , is it possible— ? With the Welsh Government 's policy of developing lifelong learning , is it possible that will be ever spread more thinly ? Dr David Blaney : That is the challenge , and there 's a piece of work that we have in our sights to look again at part-time and what it is and what the various drivers are . There 's a temptation , I think , at times , to see it solely in terms of skills for an economy , and it is important for reskilling and upskilling , but actually , it 's important for other things as well . If we see higher education solely in terms of skilling an economy , we 've missed an important part of the contribution that higher education makes . But part-time is really quite difficult , because there 's part-time that is about upskilling , part time that 's about reskilling , there 's part-time for social purposes , there 's employer-supported part-time , there 's student— . So , there 's a complexity there . Hefin David AM : But they are more reactive to rises in fees . Dr David Blaney : Well , there is a sense that they are more price sensitive , yes , and so the support regime that the Government is putting in place is important , and that probably has made a difference to the numbers of part-timers entering the system this last year . But I think we need to stake stock of what is important about part-time , what the market will deliver , what the market wo n't deliver , what we should fund and so on . And there 's a complexity around all that , as I 've indicated , which we need to do a bit of work on with the sector , with the student body as well , just to take some stock of this over the next year or so . Hefin David AM : Could we end up seeing significant fee increases for part-time students ? Dr David Blaney : My sense is we wo n't . The Government wishes us to monitor , so we monitor , and that in itself is not straightforward , actually . But your comment about price sensitivity , I think , is really the nub of it . There 's a limit to how much a fee increase would be acceptable to the part-time market . So , I think it 's kind of self-regulating in that respect . I do n't think we 'll see massive fee increases ; we might see a bit , but we wo n't see masses , I do n't think . Hefin David AM : Okay . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . We 've got some questions now on funding for research and innovation , and also we 'd like to talk a bit about a replacement for European Union funds . Siân Gwenllian . Sian Gwenllian AM : Thank you very much . If I could turn specifically to research , we know , of course , that both the Diamond and Reid reviews called for QR funding to be maintained in real terms , but the allocation is exactly the same for 2019-20 as it has been for the past nine years . Have you carried out any kind of assessment of the impact of this level of research funding on universities and , indeed , on the Welsh economy ? Dr David Blaney : I 'm sorry ; I missed the beginning of that because I could n't hear this headset . Lynne Neagle AM : Siân , could you repeat the question ? Sorry . We had a bit of a problem with translation at the beginning . Sian Gwenllian AM : Yes , no problem . I was talking about the Diamond and Reid reviews at the beginning of my question and the fact that they had recommended that QR funding should be maintained in real terms . But , of course , the sum has n't actually increased over a period of nine years . Dr David Blaney : Okay . The reason the sum has n't increased is because we have n't had enough money to be able to increase it and still meet the obligations we have to other bits of the HE system . We would dearly love to increase it . Both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid were very clear about the importance of being able to invest in our QR research funding , for a number of reasons . The capacity of the sector to be able to respond to funding opportunities elsewhere in the UK and across the rest of the world is itself determined by the size and the strength of the research base , which is sustained by QR funding . If they go for UK-based competitive research funding , that is typically constructed on the absolute assumption that QR will be part of that mix . So , they tend to fund to 80 per cent of the actual cost of the research , with the expectation that QR will plug the gap . And we know that , although the Welsh research base is extraordinarily productive , and really is punching above its weight in many ways—and I mentioned earlier the impact of the research base in the last research excellence framework—we know that , actually , it could do so much more , if it just had more scale . So , we fully endorse the reports from both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid that QR is important , and it 's important also to be able to allow institutions to invest in research areas that emerge over time . It 's almost impossible for a body like us , far less the Government , to know where these emerging strengths are going to come from , and QR provides the flexibility for institutions , which is absolutely fundamental to keeping the research base dynamic . Sian Gwenllian AM : Therefore , you do have concerns that this is n't increasing—you have that concern of a lack of increase in the level of investment . But has any particular assessment been made of the impact of not increasing that funding ? Dr David Blaney : So , there is— . Graeme Reid 's report produced an assessment of the correlation between QR funding and capacity to generate funding from other sources , and there 's a very close correlation— Sian Gwenllian AM : Has HEFCW done any assessment to look at the effect of underfunding research , to all intents and purposes ? Dr David Blaney : Not directly . We 've relied on the expert assessment of people like Graeme Reid . It 's sometimes more effective to have external experts making these points than us or the sector . Sian Gwenllian AM : Your remit requires you to encourage universities to continue to develop one particular element of research , which is educational research . How does your allocation for 2019-20 contribute to that in terms of pedagogy and educational research specifically ? Dr David Blaney : Bethan , did you want to say something on this ? Bethan Owen : I was just going to add that , when we look at the funding that comes into our sector in Wales , compared with the rest of the UK , it 's easy to see from the figures that our percentage of income that comes from research is smaller than in England , so the figures show that we receive less of the money that 's available , which is a factor that results from us having less QR as a percentage , so we 're in a situation where we get less of that UK funding that 's available as well . Sian Gwenllian AM : So , there 's a knock-on to that ; that 's what you 're trying to say . But from the point of view of my question on educational research— ? Dr David Blaney : So , we have provided funding in 2017-18 and 2018-19 to WISERD Education , which is a research collaboration between a number of the Welsh universities , specifically looking at educational issues , and we 're providing additional funding to that to add value to the Welsh Government 's existing evaluation of the progress of pioneer schools in developing the three-to-15 curriculum in Wales . I wo n't go into the full detail of it now , but it 's a five-partner project feeding into this with researchers from Cardiff , Cardiff Met , Trinity Saint David , Aber , Bangor and the University of South Wales . So , it 's a collaborative effort , and we have , in the past , also funded WISERD Education , so it 's an important research facility and increasingly being used , I 'm delighted to say , by Welsh Government in underpinning its own policy thinking . Sian Gwenllian AM : And likewise , in 2019-20 , there will be allocations specifically for this . Dr David Blaney : It 's a bit early to say yet . We have n't allocated anything specifically in the main allocations that we 've put out . There might be others to come , but we 're not yet in a position to say . Sian Gwenllian AM : Okay . Well , could you provide the remit letter from— [ Inaudible . ] —do that ? You have to do everything in the remit letters . Dr David Blaney : We do what we can to pay due regard to the remit letters , as the wording goes . So , we have it in our sights , but we 're not yet ready to make announcements . Sian Gwenllian AM : And then turning to the impact of the loss of funds were we to leave the European Union . Of course , this is going to have a far-reaching impact on future research , and the Reid review has made recommendations to mitigate this impact . So , what assessment have you made of how allocations will be able to help universities to transition away from EU funding ? Dr David Blaney : So , again , the Reid review has done a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of an impact assessment for us . And we endorse , just as the Government has endorsed , the recommendations from Reid . The Government has committed in principle to delivering Reid . The challenge is finding the money , and we fully understand that . There has been an additional £6.6 million allocated for research very recently by the Government , which we have put out specifically in line with some of the recommendations from Reid . So , that 's a start , but that 's not sustainable funding , and it 's not enough , really , but it is a good and welcome start . Reid was also not just talking about the money , but also talking about the way in which the Welsh research base both represents itself and also engages with UK-wide developments . And in response to that , we have recently issued our own vision for research and innovation , which was developed over a number of months , following the Reid report closely , working with stakeholders , including the Welsh Government , in order to try and set a vision for how we respond to the challenges facing research in the future , including the reduction , potentially , of access to EU funds . And a lot of that is— . These Reid recommendations all come together ; they 're coherent . A lot of that requires investment in the Welsh research base in order to be able to go for competitive funding at a UK level . Since it seems possible at least , and possibly even likely , that any money retrieved from not having to invest in the EU will sit in London rather than necessarily being devolved to the devolved administrations—we understand fully the Welsh Government 's position on that , and we do n't disagree with it . But either way , we need a research base that 's able to compete , and that 's why the investment recommendations of Reid are so important . Sian Gwenllian AM : Yes . I think Reid was saying that there may be pots of money out there that are n't being accessed at the moment by Welsh universities . Are you able to help then within that process ? Bethan Owen : One aspect that we do intend to fund—and this is from Diamond , as well as Reid—is to place funding back into the system for innovation . We 're consulting currently , with the intention , if the funding is available to us , clearly , in the year 2020-21 , to provide £15 million back into the sector in innovation funding . That 's funding that we had to take out when the new fee system came in . That is part of promoting the innovation , and part of the research portfolio as well . Sian Gwenllian AM : Is that part of the UKRI funding ? There is some £7 billion in the hands of that organisation , as I understand it , and there may be some possibilities there too . Bethan Owen : That £15 million will be money that comes from us , but the intention is that the money will go in in order to improve universities ' ability to access that funding from UKRI . So , Innovate UK would be the part of UKRI—and that we improve our ability to get funding from outside Wales . And , then , Graeme Reid says the same thing in terms of research—that we need more funding to do the same thing there . Dr David Blaney : And , then , there 's also the recommendation from Reid that Wales needs to be better embedded in the conversations that are going on on a UK-wide basis , so the Welsh Government has established a presence in London in respect of research , and we have a colleague in HEFCW who is fractionally embedded in the United Kingdom Research and Innovation specifically to respond to that recommendation . And that is actually paying dividends ; we are strengthening our relationship with the UK machinery , which is essential if we 're to understand where they 're heading and what their funding bids are all about , and even to be able to influence those . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , Siân ? Sian Gwenllian AM : So , as far as research is concerned , it 's not all doom and gloom . Dr David Blaney : Yes , I mean , you know , things are looking up . There is money coming in and if the Government , as it is able to , can find money and can invest in this area , then that will help . Sian Gwenllian AM : Thank you very much . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . Just a couple of questions from me , then , before you close : what is your recent work on the 'basket of goods ' show regarding student accommodation costs ? And have any institutions used their 2019-20 fee and access plans to make commitments to more affordable accommodation for under-represented groups ? Dr David Blaney : First of all , on the basket of goods , the work we 're doing now—we 're currently in train in terms of analysing the data in respect of the basket of goods , so this is slightly premature , but our early look at the data indicates that there are no increases in costs , accommodation or other , that would cause us concern . So , it does n't look like institutions are succumbing to the temptation to up their income streams from other costs . So , that 's good . In terms of the fee and access plans , the sector has committed over £28 million of investment in student support-related activities from the fee and access plans , and that includes , in many instances , bursaries that are designed to help students cope with the costs of accommodation and the cost of living more generally . The support is provided for a range of purposes , but a couple of examples , just very quickly : Trinity Saint David , since we 've talked about them a lot today , they offer £1,000 bursary to care leavers , which is in addition to local authority support for care leavers . Bangor also offer targeted support for care leavers , and these are often also extended , so they apply not just in term time , but throughout the holiday time as well , because people still need to live during the holidays . So , there is investment going in from the fee plans in that support . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . And just one final question from me then , going back to Trinity Saint David : are you concerned that the governing body of Trinity Saint David has taken decisions that have led to that material uncertainty , and is that unprecedented in Wales ? Dr David Blaney : My view is that the decisions that the governing body made were , in our view , perfectly rational decisions to have made , given the information they had at the time . So , what 's happened is that a number of unforeseen events have arisen , which , actually , I do n't think it 's reasonable to expect them to have foreseen , and it 's just a combination of these that has caused the cash pressure . So , I do n't see this as a governance failure , and they are engaging with those challenges . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . We 've come to the end of our time , so can I thank you both for attending and for answering all our questions this morning ? You did say that you would give the committee a note on reserves for the last four years , so we 'd be grateful if we could receive that . And , as usual , you 'll be sent a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting . Thank you , again , for your time this morning . Dr David Blaney : Thank you . Bethan Owen : Thank you very much . Lynne Neagle AM : Item 3 , then , is papers to note . Paper to note 1 is a letter from me to the Deputy Minister requesting further information for our scrutiny of the Children ( Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment ) ( Wales ) Bill . Paper to note 2 is a letter from me to the Children 's Commissioner for Wales also asking for further information to pursue our scrutiny of the Bill . And paper to note 3 is a letter to the Minister for Education asking for an update on the framework for young people educated other than at school . Are Members happy to note those ? Thank you . Item 4 , then , is a motion under Standing Order 17.42 to propose that we resolve to meet in private for the remainder of this meeting and for the whole meeting on 10 July . Are Members content ? Thank you . 
Query : What were the three main causes for the financial challenges facing the universities ? Dr David Blaney : Well , shall I just start with a couple of contextualising comments and Bethan can come in then with some detail ? It 's undeniably the case there are financial challenges facing our universities . They result from three main causes : one is the impact of the demographic dip of 18-year-olds , which is deeper and longer in Wales than it is elsewhere in the UK . There are increased pension costs and , actually , increased costs generally . And , of course , we also have current uncertainty as a result of the Augar review in England , and whether that might play into Wales , and also Brexit . These challenges are not unique to Wales ; the majority of the UK universities are actually taking out cost one way or another . So , this is not a Welsh issue . Before the Diamond review of fees and funding in Wales , there was a pre-existing funding gap in resource between England and Wales , and even now , that 's still the case . So , Welsh higher education institutions are approximately £40 million worse off than they would be in the English system . That 's a challenge , and that is a result from a political decision to invest in students , and that 's fine . The money 's gone into the system but it has n't gone into universities , necessarily . So , these are serious challenges for institutions to manage , but I think it is a managed situation . We 're not seeing a crisis ; we are seeing some real challenges , and there is a distinction , I think , between— . We have to understand , though , that taking out cost to balance the books has a detrimental effect on the capacity . Obviously it impacts on the people who lose their jobs immediately , but there 's a medium to longer term impact on the capacity of the system to deliver for Wales . They are taking out capacity ; they 're not cutting at fat now , they 're cutting out core capacity . And so , the range of the curriculum , the range of research and innovation , the range of the contribution that universities can make will be diminished by that . And against that backdrop , the introduction of the Diamond reforms is hugely important—delivery of that is going to be really important—and we are really pleased to see the Minister able to meet her commitments in respect of that . The Diamond money is coming in . This forthcoming year will be the first year we see an increase in the resource , through us , to higher education . And the projections in future years are better still , and that will be extremely important . The performance of the sector is very good ; we had the national student survey results out yesterday . Wales is still the best in the UK , which is excellent . We have the best impact from research in Wales across the UK . So , all of that is very positive , but that is also being done at some cost . There are some very tired staff in universities , and we 've seen some stuff in the press recently about some of the impact of stress there as well . 
Query : What did the meeting discuss about universities that had secured funding for investing in their estates ? Bethan Owen : And , there are also differences in the way that universities have secured funding for investing in their estates . So , for example , Cardiff University have had a bond rather than borrowing , which you draw down as you 're spending . So , in the short term , the reserves of Cardiff will appear as though they have significant cash balances , but all of those are restricted for investment in the estate and , over the next two or three years , will be utilised for that . Angela Burns AM : So , overall , you 're painting a picture of a sector that 's under a significant degree of financial stress , and this is obviously using your key financial indicators . Do you monitor each and every university , or do you wait for them to come back and tell you what their situation is ? Bethan Owen : We monitor , we receive forecasts , five-year forecasts , and we meet frequently with all our universities now . It varies , depending on the risks of the universities , as to how frequently we meet , but we 're actually meeting with every university because even the forecast that we received last July , the changes , even in the 12-month period , are significant enough for us to need a better understanding of what the latest position is . The forecasts , if I just run through— . We had a sector that , in 2017-18 , had a deficit . Although it had a turnover and income of £1.5 billion , which had increased , nonetheless it had a small deficit of 0.4 per cent of income in 2017-18 , which was an improvement on the deficit the year before of 1.7 per cent , but notably , again , the sector in England were looking at surpluses of 3 per cent to 4 per cent in the same period . The forecasts that we had this time last year were indicating that , for 2018-19 , we should have a sector that 's roughly in a break-even position , but that has to be caveated with waiting for new forecasts in July , where there will have to be a reflection of the pension costs , and there have been significant changes in pension costs , both for the teachers ' pension scheme and the universities ' superannuation scheme as well , and those will be significant costs that universities have to build into their forecasts at a time when their income , certainly their fee income , is not increasing , and that is the challenge . Angela Burns AM : Are we going to lose any universities in the next couple of years ? Dr David Blaney : I do n't think so . As I said earlier on , we 're not seeing a crisis , we 're seeing really challenging circumstances for institutions to manage . At the moment , our sense is they are managing them , so one of the things we try to do is to make sure that , insofar as we can see it , we are making sure that the institutions are alert to the challenges they 're facing , and are actually engaging those challenges properly , and we are seeing that at the moment . So I think what we will see if the pressure continues unabated is more costs being taken out , so more jobs being lost , more capacity being lost , but that 's not the same as falling over . I do n't see people falling over . There is always the possibility of structural change within the sector , and that might be one of the solutions that institutions think about , but it 's not a policy position , and it 's not always a good short-term response to crisis anyway , actually . But I think , as I say , we 're in a managed situation , but the challenges are quite acute . But I do n't see an institution falling over in the foreseeable future . 
Query : What was the government 's plan towards the structural change ? Angela Burns AM : When you talk about structural change , are you referring to the fact that certain offshoots or divisions might close ? I bring this up because I 'm the Assembly Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire , and I have had multiple representations from students , and their parents , who are about to go to Lampeter and who 've been told that courses are being restructured , there 's a massive staff loss , and they have concerns about whether the three-year commitment they 're about to make to a course is going to be able to be sustained . So I am trying to drill down a little bit , because I think it 's only fair for the students to know what they 're up against , and also it 's a bit like in the great depression—you can start a run on something , ca n't you ? Because if enough people believe it , then suddenly enough people will stop going to what is an excellent little university , really top-quality in medieval literature , in archaeology . And I 'm just talking about one , but I know there are problems in other universities around Wales , so I just wondered if you could comment on that and also what processes you as HEFCW might have in place to protect any student who does find themselves in a situation where their course appears to be disappearing before their eyes . Dr David Blaney : So , there 's quite a lot in that question , actually . Let me try not to forget any of the elements . First of all , your comment about causing a run is a serious consideration . So , if we look at the debate that happened in the Senedd last week , from my reading of the transcript , it was actually quite a balanced debate where pretty much every contributor made reference to the contribution that higher education is making . There was reference to the national student survey scores , and in many ways Wales is the best place in the UK to come and be a student , because you are looked after properly in Wales . But there was also a perfectly legitimate exploration of whether or not there 's a crisis , and if you look at the way in which that was represented in the media , the crisis bit stuck and the rest of it did n't . At the point where the sector is trying very hard to recruit students , it 's really quite unhelpful that you get that sort of representation . So we do need to make sure , I think , all of us , that we try to avoid a situation where there can be media amplification of a problem that 's not actually as acute as the media are portraying it , and that is very harsh . I 'm not being critical of the political process here , but it has ripples and we do need to be careful that we do n't start a run on this . In terms of the specifics at Lampeter , we understand that there are no plans to close any of the departments , and there certainly will not be plans to pull the rug out from under continuing students . That is just not what institutions do . So there 's an absolute obligation on them to meet their commitments , and that 's a contractual obligation anyway , so it 's a legal obligation . But we also have a quality machinery that we operate where we would expect institutions to be able to demonstrate that they 've put in place appropriate arrangements to ensure that students can finish their programmes of study . So they 're not going to be recruiting students to programmes that they 're not planning to continue—they just are not going to do that . And if you think about it in a market context , it would be suicidal for a university to treat their students like that . Angela Burns AM : But I have to ask these questions because the auditor was very clear that there was a material uncertainty in Trinity Saint David 's financial plans . Dr David Blaney : Yes , I understand that , so let ’ s come back to the material uncertainty . [ Interruption . ] No , I understand , and that 's fine . What I 'm hoping to try and express is that we have absolute confidence that the institutions will not do the dirty on their students . They will look after their students and if they 're recruiting to programmes , they are recruiting to programmes that they are planning to run , and run through to completion . And the expectations that we place on them in terms of our quality assurance machinery is precisely that—when they are engaged in portfolio change , they have to look after the interest of the students that they currently have . In terms of our oversight and monitoring , our primary consideration , again , is the interest of the students . They are the people who have , in many ways , least influence over what happens in terms of the way an institution is managed . Although , they do have a voice and , actually , the arrangements for the student voice in Wales are , again , better than elsewhere in the UK . But , nonetheless , we do not wish to see students becoming innocent victims of difficulties of management and financing . And so that is our primary consideration when we 're looking at these institutions . Our institutional risk review process is fundamentally designed to make sure that institutions are grappling with their problems before they become a crisis . So , we have machinery , which has 70/80 different factors and hundreds of questions that we ask twice a year , to interrogate the performance of the institutions and to make sure that we are seeing them managing the issues that they 're facing . So , it 's not the challenges you face , it 's the way you face your challenges—it 's a cliché—and , at the moment , they are managing them , but if we were in any way concerned that they were n't , the people who are most at risk in that context are the students and we will be intervening to make sure that they were cited , and we do intervene when we have to . 
Query : What was the government 's policy towards the university 's estates strategy ? Angela Burns AM : Well , following on from what you said , I 've just got two really specific technical questions , then , to ask , because you said that you look across the whole scope to make sure that they are meeting all of their correct liquidity ratios and so on . So , considering how much is invested in their estates , are you happy that each university 's estates strategy and its financing is prudent and has appropriate governing-body oversight in place ? Dr David Blaney : Yes , so the estates strategies that institutions operate are overseen by either the full governing body or relevant sub-committees in respect of every institution , so there is proper governance oversight . And in all of those instances , there is staff and student engagement as well in the strategic approach on estates . So , the machinery is in place— Angela Burns AM : Because it 's the big thing that drives most of university borrowing , is n't it ? Dr David Blaney : Indeed , it is . Angela Burns AM : So , if our universities are on a sticky wicket , we just need to know that the borrowing that they 're undertaking is absolutely prudently assessed and is appropriate . So , as long as you 're content , if I can hear you say that— [ Laughter . ] Dr David Blaney : Okay . We 're content on two fronts : one is that the governance machinery within the institutions is structured appropriately to look at that , but also that if the institutions are wanting to engage in anything other than relatively trivial borrowing , they have to get our consent as well . And what we do n't do is second-guess everything , but what we do do is make sure that the governing body , or its relevant committees , have been asking the right questions . So , there are two bits to this . Angela Burns AM : And then—sorry . Bethan Owen : Can I just add to that , then ? Angela Burns AM : Yes , of course . Bethan Owen : In asking for the forecasts , we have reinforced this year the importance of universities looking at different scenarios . So , to be looking at the demographic and maybe in the past , where there 's potentially been growth in the system and universities have built that into their forecast , we have explicitly asked this year that we are provided—not just the governing body—with the scenario where there is no growth in the income . That 's not the core forecast , but a scenario , so that it 's quite clear how reliant the forecasts are on that growth , and if that growth does n't come through , what the contingency plans are for ensuring that all the cost commitments can be met . And we should probably just differentiate between—we have a role before borrowings are entered into , but all the best forecasts in the world can never quite predict , certainly what 's happened in the last two years , probably , in universities . So , there are significant borrowings that are now committed to and the key measures we are looking at are universities ' capacity to meet their covenants and their repayments under those borrowings , because that 's essential for maintaining their liquidity . Angela Burns AM : Which actually , neatly , thank you , brings me to my last question , which is : have any universities broken those loan covenants or been close to breaking them , unable to pay their borrowings as and when they fall due ? Bethan Owen : There was a significant change in accounting standards in 2015 , financial reporting standard 102 , so most universities had to renegotiate their covenants , but it was because the accounts were looking very different . The accounting standards brought about changes in how income was recognised and how some service concession arrangements , largely student accommodation arrangements , and pension costs , significantly , were recognised in the accounts . So , most universities have had to renegotiate covenants , but we 're not aware of any who 've had to renegotiate due to covenant breaches , other than one which the University of Wales Trinity Saint David disclosed in their financial statements—that they did need to renegotiate their financing arrangements , which they have done earlier this year , and they have now negotiated new covenants . It 's a core part of financial management in universities now that you manage your relationship with your lender as well as with us . Breaching covenants in themselves is different to doing that with your lender being unaware and the factors being within your control . So , again , from that perspective , we have the covenants built into our forecasts , we require the forecasts to show how the university are planning to be within their covenants . The nature of those covenants vary , but most of them require a measure of cash flow , a ratio between the cash generated and the cost of debt , so there is close monitoring that is required because of the borrowing in the system , as well as our ongoing monitoring as well . 
Query : What was the solution to risk appetite ? Hefin David AM : So , what about risk appetite ? Do you feel that any governing bodies are exhibiting what might be considered to be an imprudent risk appetite ? Dr David Blaney : I do n't think so , and this manifests itself in two ways . So , we would see this coming through in forecasts , and we would see it coming through in requests for borrowings , predominantly . Actually , we 'd see it in other ways as well . Our links into institutions are many and various , and we have our formal stuff , but we all have links into institutions that are informal and we— . One of the beauties of the scale of the sector in Wales is we can see the institutions in a way that they ca n't hope to in England . It 's just completely different . And so we would see it in other ways . But we have , in some instances , I think it 's fair to say , helped institutions to think again about some of their aspirations . So , where we 've seen things and we think , 'That just looks ridiculously optimistic , ' we 've just asked the questions . We do n't say , 'No , you ca n't do that , ' because they are autonomous , they make the decisions , but we try to make sure that they 're asking the right questions . Hefin David AM : So , would you see that governing bodies are falling short in doing that themselves , in that , where they become strategic decisions that require due diligence , are the governing bodies themselves presenting that challenge ? Or the fact you 've just said that , does that suggest to us that , actually , they are falling short ? Dr David Blaney : I think there 's a mixture of things going on . We have a slightly different perspective and we have a perspective that is very intimately informed in terms of how the institution is performing . So , you have a governing body with a range of perspectives , and you will also have people who are very committed and very enthusiastic about the institution , and just occasionally it 's helpful to get a slightly external perspective on these things . So , I do n't think it 's a shortfall as such , but I just think— 
Query : What did the meeting talk about to include more people in risk management ? Dr David Blaney : The machinery depends on having a body like HEFCW doing some of that role , and the people who lend money to institutions are absolutely clear about that . So , we have relationships with the banks ; they come and see us every now and again—typically not to talk about individual clients but just to talk about what we do and how we do it . Interestingly , for example , when Michael Barber got up before Christmas and said there will be no bail-outs of universities , we had banks on the phone to us within a couple of days , wanting just to talk about how it is in Wales and is it still how it used to be . So , they are very keenly aware of what we do . So , it 's not really a governance failure ; it 's just that the machinery includes us . Hefin David AM : Okay , that 's important . And one of the things , from a distance—I mean , I 've been involved in different ways in an institution , and looking at the institutions from a distance . There are people , as you say , involved , and people always make the difference in different cultures . Do you find that the relationships between executive teams and governors is effective , and are they sufficiently robust and challenging as well ? Those executive permanent staff and the governors—is there challenge there ? Dr David Blaney : I would say , in the main , yes . Occasionally , we help the governors to ask the right questions , so occasionally that external perspective we 've just discussed is helpful in that regard . Actually , there are times when there are tensions between the executive and governing bodies , inevitably—that 's not something that 's remarkable—and we can feel that as well . We have conversations with both governing bodies and executives . Hefin David AM : And that can become apparent from a public point of view as well—you know , media reports and— . Dr David Blaney : Yes , sometimes these things can spill , and the governing bodies also include student representation , staff representation , who are typically union reps , and so , you know , there are all sorts of— . I 'm not in any way saying that people are indiscreet , but there are all sorts of interests that are sitting around that table that have to be managed within a governance context . So , sometimes it can spill . And these tensions are not all-out war , but there are sometimes differences of view and they have to be worked through , and that 's governance working properly , I think . 
Query : What was the direction of travel between universities with high risks and those with medium risks ? Hefin David AM : And a last question : you 've identified one university as high risk , five as medium , and two as low in the short to medium term . You 're obviously not going to tell us which , but what I 'm interested in is the direction of travel , and whether those that are 'medium'—are they at any point at risk of becoming 'high ' in the near future ? Dr David Blaney : I think it 's fair to say that the direction of travel is that we 're seeing an increased risk profile in the sector in Wales , and it 's about the financial pressures that we 've already discussed this morning . And that is why the efforts that the Minister has gone to to secure the Diamond settlement , and , indeed , other bits of money now and again , are so important . So , she 's doing what she can , and that 's really good , but we always knew that , between the point of the Diamond recommendations being made and the full implementation , there was going to be a valley to cross . The new machinery costs more as you phase out the old as well . So , the amount of funding was always going to be under pressure ; there 's a demographic dip , and there are the other contextual factors we 've discussed . We always knew there was going to be a valley . And the institutions have been working very hard to try not to take cost out now that they really do n't have to take out , because they do n't want to reduce capacity , which they 'll struggle to recover again when the financial position improves . So , they are seeing deficits , which are managed deficits , where they 're spending more than their income in order just to keep the capacity in . So , they 're being as responsible as we could expect them to be in this . Hefin David AM : And , if you 're back in a year or two 's time , the next few years , are we confident that there wo n't be more in the high-risk category ? You said you do n't see collapse , but are we confident there wo n't be more in the high-risk category ? Dr David Blaney : Well , I think what I would always say about this process is that it does n't guarantee 100 per cent accuracy . We can only go on what we can see . So , I wouldn't— . HEFCW is innately cautious as an organisation , so I 'm not going to say we 're confident , but that does n't mean to say we 're worried either . Hefin David AM : Right , okay . So , to answer my question : are we likely to see more in the high-risk category or not ? Dr David Blaney : We might . 
Query : What was Bethan Owen 's comment towards the high-risk category ? Bethan Owen : And , just to add , I think the key bit of that is maintaining the attractiveness of Welsh universities to students , because a large proportion are coming not from just Wales , but from England and internationally—so , that 's a key part—and also that our research portfolio is invested in , and that also brings economic benefits . So , I think those are the two that we are [ correction : need to be ] able to maintain : the institutions as attractive options for students , and that our research capacity is invested in . 
Query : What did the meeting discuss about the QR research funding ? Sian Gwenllian AM : Yes , no problem . I was talking about the Diamond and Reid reviews at the beginning of my question and the fact that they had recommended that QR funding should be maintained in real terms . But , of course , the sum has n't actually increased over a period of nine years . Dr David Blaney : Okay . The reason the sum has n't increased is because we have n't had enough money to be able to increase it and still meet the obligations we have to other bits of the HE system . We would dearly love to increase it . Both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid were very clear about the importance of being able to invest in our QR research funding , for a number of reasons . The capacity of the sector to be able to respond to funding opportunities elsewhere in the UK and across the rest of the world is itself determined by the size and the strength of the research base , which is sustained by QR funding . If they go for UK-based competitive research funding , that is typically constructed on the absolute assumption that QR will be part of that mix . So , they tend to fund to 80 per cent of the actual cost of the research , with the expectation that QR will plug the gap . And we know that , although the Welsh research base is extraordinarily productive , and really is punching above its weight in many ways—and I mentioned earlier the impact of the research base in the last research excellence framework—we know that , actually , it could do so much more , if it just had more scale . So , we fully endorse the reports from both Ian Diamond and Graeme Reid that QR is important , and it 's important also to be able to allow institutions to invest in research areas that emerge over time . It 's almost impossible for a body like us , far less the Government , to know where these emerging strengths are going to come from , and QR provides the flexibility for institutions , which is absolutely fundamental to keeping the research base dynamic . 
Query : Had HEFCW done any assessment of the effect of underfunding research ? Sian Gwenllian AM : Has HEFCW done any assessment to look at the effect of underfunding research , to all intents and purposes ? Dr David Blaney : Not directly . We 've relied on the expert assessment of people like Graeme Reid . It 's sometimes more effective to have external experts making these points than us or the sector . 
Query : How would the allocation contribute to educational research ? Sian Gwenllian AM : Your remit requires you to encourage universities to continue to develop one particular element of research , which is educational research . How does your allocation for 2019-20 contribute to that in terms of pedagogy and educational research specifically ? Dr David Blaney : Bethan , did you want to say something on this ? Bethan Owen : I was just going to add that , when we look at the funding that comes into our sector in Wales , compared with the rest of the UK , it 's easy to see from the figures that our percentage of income that comes from research is smaller than in England , so the figures show that we receive less of the money that 's available , which is a factor that results from us having less QR as a percentage , so we 're in a situation where we get less of that UK funding that 's available as well . Sian Gwenllian AM : So , there 's a knock-on to that ; that 's what you 're trying to say . But from the point of view of my question on educational research— ? Dr David Blaney : So , we have provided funding in 2017-18 and 2018-19 to WISERD Education , which is a research collaboration between a number of the Welsh universities , specifically looking at educational issues , and we 're providing additional funding to that to add value to the Welsh Government 's existing evaluation of the progress of pioneer schools in developing the three-to-15 curriculum in Wales . I wo n't go into the full detail of it now , but it 's a five-partner project feeding into this with researchers from Cardiff , Cardiff Met , Trinity Saint David , Aber , Bangor and the University of South Wales . So , it 's a collaborative effort , and we have , in the past , also funded WISERD Education , so it 's an important research facility and increasingly being used , I 'm delighted to say , by Welsh Government in underpinning its own policy thinking . Sian Gwenllian AM : And likewise , in 2019-20 , there will be allocations specifically for this . Dr David Blaney : It 's a bit early to say yet . We have n't allocated anything specifically in the main allocations that we 've put out . There might be others to come , but we 're not yet in a position to say . Sian Gwenllian AM : Okay . Well , could you provide the remit letter from— [ Inaudible . ] —do that ? You have to do everything in the remit letters . Dr David Blaney : We do what we can to pay due regard to the remit letters , as the wording goes . So , we have it in our sights , but we 're not yet ready to make announcements . 
Query : What was the impact of the loss of funds to leave the European Union and what would be the solutions accordingly ? Dr David Blaney : We do what we can to pay due regard to the remit letters , as the wording goes . So , we have it in our sights , but we 're not yet ready to make announcements . Sian Gwenllian AM : And then turning to the impact of the loss of funds were we to leave the European Union . Of course , this is going to have a far-reaching impact on future research , and the Reid review has made recommendations to mitigate this impact . So , what assessment have you made of how allocations will be able to help universities to transition away from EU funding ? 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Lynne Neagle AM : Good morning , everyone . Welcome to the Children , Young People and Education Committee . We 've received no apologies , although Dawn Bowden is running late . I 'll take this opportunity to welcome Dawn formally to the committee but also to place on record our thanks to John Griffiths for his service to the committee . Are there any declarations of interest , please ? No . Okay . Item 2 , then , this morning is a scrutiny session with a focus on higher and further education . I 'm very pleased to welcome Kirsty Williams , Cabinet Secretary for Education , Eluned Morgan , Minister for Welsh Language and Lifelong Learning , and Huw Morris , who is the group director of skills , higher education and lifelong learning . Thank you all for your attendance this morning . If you 're okay with it , we 'll go straight into questions . The first questions are from Suzy Davies . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you , Chair . If we can just start with teacher training and teacher training for secondary school teachers in particular , obviously there 's been what looks like a trend in recent years in filling the places for secondary school training . Obviously , this is at Welsh teacher training centres . Do you think there 's still a problem recruiting teachers into the 300 priority places , or is there a trend where things are getting better ? Kirsty Williams AM : Thank you , Suzy . I think , for this year 's intake , although we 're in touch with our providers , we 're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year 's intake for a couple of months . But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets . So , there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs . So , what we 're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class , so that , actually , Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher . You 'll be aware that we 've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year . We have looked at financial incentives . It 's not the whole answer , I think , to these issues , but it 's part of a mixture of things that we need to do . You 'll be aware that , for priority subjects , with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications , those financial incentives are now £20,000 a year . We 're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise . We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees , e-mailing them , sending them materials to ask them to consider ( 1 ) becoming a teacher , and ( 2 ) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales . We are now part of a full national programme of ITE recruitment , giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher . So , there 's a whole package of things we need to do . In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff , and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you for that answer . I can see there 's a lot of activity , but what exactly is it responding to ? Presumably , some research has been done about why people do n't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers . I ca n't believe it 's just about ITE , although this is very valuable , what you 're talking about . Is there something that 's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching is n't a profession they want to go into ? Is that something that 's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well ? Kirsty Williams AM : No . I think what you will find is that this is n't a uniquely Welsh issue . I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border , which proves to me that money is n't necessarily the entire answer , because , despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses , they 're not able to do that in England either . So , that proves to me—what the research does show—that it 's not money alone that will get people onto these courses . Interestingly , I do n't even think it 's a UK problem . Recently , as you 'll be aware via my written statement , I attended the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory , which is a system-to-system conference . If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world , the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention . In the USA , they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers . So , in the Californian system , significant teacher shortages , and in Oregon , Washington . I met with New York state—significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state , and in Finland , Australia . So , this is a common issue across the globe , really . That 's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner—it 's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off . One of the things that we have got strong performance in , and I think this is perhaps something that we 're trying to follow up on , are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status—so , those are people who are training on the job . Those remain strong . There 's high demand for those places , so much so that we 've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year , which says to me that—there 's definitely a place for the traditional , 'Take a year off , do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'—actually , that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching , which is why , of course , from next year , we will have our unique part-time PGCE route into qualification . So , that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities , so they can earn while they learn , or maybe they 've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course . I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools . So , there 's no one thing , I think , that we can do that will solve this issue . But it is an international issue , I agree with that . Suzy Davies AM : Okay . Well , that 's what I was after finding out , and , actually , what you 've just said about the part-time PGCE is pretty interesting as well , because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching , that 's got to help , has n't it ? Kirsty Williams AM : Can I just agree with you ? I think that is really , really important—that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce . I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really , really valuable . I was up in the Deeside Sixth just last week , talking to the A-level chemistry teacher . She had been a teacher for a while , she 'd gone into industry , worked in industry , and now had come back into teaching . She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue . I 'm very keen to increase the diversity in our teaching workforce and I 'm very keen in looking at career changers , who perhaps have different life experience and work experience , coming into our teaching profession . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you for that . Part of that diversity , of course—it would be great if you had more people interested in qualifying to teach through the medium of Welsh . Great aspirations ; the trend 's going the other way . No-one can solve this in 280 characters , I get that , but can you give us some indication about why you think this is proving still such an unattractive option when it 's clear that there 's a policy for this country to improve the number of Welsh speakers ? You 'd have thought there 'd be a pretty good carrot for this . Kirsty Williams AM : Sure . Again , data for recruitment for the 2018-19 cohort is not yet available and we are , as I said , keeping in touch with our ITE centres to keep a close eye on them . I think an important thing to recognise is that there is a difference between the number of people who are on courses where there is a specific designation that enables them to teach through the medium of Welsh and those people who have linguistic ability and Welsh ability but do n't necessarily do a course that allows them . So , there is a difference . We do think that , for the 2016-17 cohort , there were an additional 130 qualifiers that , actually , were fluent in Welsh and who could have gone on to teach in Welsh-medium schools , did n't necessarily do a course that gave them that designation . But , clearly , we 've got three academic years now to get to the targets that we 've set ourselves . The evaluation of Welsh-medium provision in ITE reported at the end of last month , and the Minister and officials are busy working now to implement the recommendations of the report that was published , I think , on 28 September , to be able to move this agenda forward . Again , we 've got new incentives , this year , both for people starting their course and then for teachers who complete their QTS after a year . So , we 've added in new financial incentives this year to try and address some of those issues . But , clearly , these are ambitious targets and we will need to have a step change over the next three years if we 're to meet them . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you for that , Cabinet Secretary . Thank you for that answer . We 're now talking about cohorts of students coming into PGCE and teaching degrees . If they 're from Wales , they will have had Welsh as part of their education from day one , and we 'll accept there are varying qualities in different parts of Wales , different attitudes towards it as well . But there is n't a single a person now who 's been through Welsh education who can say they have no Welsh at all , unless they 've moved into the system from , say , England very , very recently . What is being done within the teaching qualifications , including the degrees , to ensure that , at least in Welsh universities , those nascent Welsh language skills are at least kept alive , even though we 're not talking necessarily about being at a level where people can teach through the medium ? It's the age-old question : once the school gate closes , is that the end of their Welsh use ? So , is there something—it wo n't be Donaldson , but in the teacher training qualifications—that is keeping this going and , hopefully , increasing the usability of the Welsh skills they have ? Kirsty Williams AM : Well , in terms of how we can encourage children who have got Welsh skills as a result of their education up to 16 , how they can continue to use those skills and , potentially , use them in the workplace , I 'm sure Eluned will want to talk about some of the work , for instance , in other , non-teaching sectors . But , with regard to ITE , you 'll be aware that , in the evaluation report , as I said , that was published , the report comes forward with two options in how we could develop an intervention programme to support Welsh language skills amongst all primary and secondary ITE entrants . So , what we 'll be doing now as a result of that report is that we 'll be working very closely with our ITE centres to develop and agree upon minimum provision that constitutes those skill levels within ITE provision for all teachers . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Llyr . Llyr Gruffydd AM : You have your targets for 2021 , in terms of numbers of teachers coming through the system , which is positive , although , clearly , the report or the review itself said that , actually , we need to double the numbers , really . But it 's not just the trends that are going down ; it 's a cataclysmic drop , really . We 've lost 24 per cent in the number of people over the last four or five years who are going into teacher training to study subjects that they could teach through the medium of Welsh . So , it 's a huge turnaround that we 're looking for , and I 'm not getting the feeling that the level of ambition and the answers that you 're giving here this morning reflect the level of action that's needed , really . Kirsty Williams AM : Well , first of all , as I tried to illustrate to Suzy , the figures on their own tell one story , but there are additional people in the system with an ability to speak Welsh and to be able to use— Llyr Gruffydd AM : I think it's 40 per cent of those who are currently in the system who don't— Kirsty Williams AM : —the language and skills . And if we look at qualifiers of ITE courses in Wales by degree type , actually , we see a different trend—we see numbers going up . So , there are statistics and there are statistics . Depending on which ones you look at , it 's quite a complex picture . And that 's why we had the evaluation report . We understand and we know and acknowledge that there is more work to be done . That 's why we have got the evaluation of provision in ITE and that 's why we 'll be taking that ambition forward . We know what we need to do . As I said , we 're not sitting back and hoping that something miraculous will change things . We are pulling levers and putting in place plans to improve that situation . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Thank you for that . Clearly , there are statistics and there are statistics , so could you just explain to us which statistics you 've used for your targets for growth over the next three years ? Kirsty Williams AM : Well , that comes as a result of the work done for the 2050— Llyr Gruffydd AM : Upon which baseline are you basing the increases that you 're projecting ? Kirsty Williams AM : We 're using the baseline of 2012-13 . There has been a decline since then . Llyr Gruffydd AM : That 's the one I was using when I said '24 per cent reduction ' . Kirsty Williams AM : There has been a decline in those numbers . That 's why , as I said , we 're doing the work that we need to do to reverse that decline . In using those numbers , we also know that there are additional people in the system who are not captured in those figures and who do have the linguistic ability to use their language positively in school settings . So , what I 'm saying is that that does n't tell us the whole story , but I will be the first to admit that there is a significant job of work with our ITE providers to ensure that we will have the skilled professionals that we need to deliver on our ambitions , and I 'm not hiding from that . Eluned Morgan AM : Also , I just think it 's worth saying that a lot of this is about building the confidence of those people who actually can speak Welsh , who are not teaching through the medium of Welsh , and to give them that support . First of all , we need to identify who these people are , so there is a job of work being undertaken now in terms of registration in particular—when people register , let 's just make sure that we collect that kind of data . Kirsty Williams AM : We do n't even do that consistently at the moment . One of the recommendations of the report is that there is no consistent approach to understanding this baseline data and there 's no consistent competency test that people start at the beginning of their course , so we need a national approach rather than leaving it to individual institutions . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Have we missed any tricks , potentially , in terms of the reforms to accrediting ITE , for example , in terms of , maybe , strengthening aspects around the Welsh language and provision in that respect ? Kirsty Williams AM : No , I do n't believe so . The accreditation process , which is independent of the Government—the accreditation process demands of our ITE providers that their provision will be able to meet the goals of our curriculum . Our curriculum is very clear about the equality of the language and the ability of our children , through all stages of their education journey , to be able to be bilingual children . Llyr Gruffydd AM : So , that requirement , as far you 're concerned , is there . Kirsty Williams AM : Yes . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Yes , okay . Diolch—thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Before I turn to Hefin , can I just clarify— ? In answer to Suzy Davies , you said that 65 per cent of the places in Welsh training centres had been filled . Is that 65 per cent of the priority places ? Kirsty Williams AM : Priority places . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you very much . Kirsty Williams AM : Sixty-five per cent of the priority courses are being met . Lynne Neagle AM : Lovely , thank you for clarifying that . Hefin . Hefin David AM : The decision by the Education Workforce Council not to accredit the University of South Wales with the ability to deliver teacher training—what are your views and concerns about that ? Kirsty Williams AM : The process is independent of Government , and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on that , especially as I understand that there is an appeals process that may be being undertaken . What I would say is that from the very outset of our ITE reforms we have made it very clear that I expect very high standards in our ITE system , but the process is independent of this Government . I have confidence in the people who have been appointed by the EWC to undertake that process , but it is independent of me , and it 's not appropriate for me to comment on that further . Hefin David AM : I fully understand that and the need for distance for the EWC , but there 'll be an impact on students and staff . Students , first of all : are you concerned that the reduction in providers might have an impact on students , and those students going through the second year at USW ? Would you have concerns about that issue ? Kirsty Williams AM : In terms of the overall numbers , we will be looking to commission from those institutions that have been accredited the number of training places that our planning tool says that we need . So , in terms of an overall number of places , we will commission from those accredited units . Clearly , there will be a responsibility upon the University of South Wales to ensure that those students already in the system are able to complete their studies and their course , with the appropriate level of support and tuition to enable them to achieve their career aspirations and to graduate from that programme . Hefin David AM : And what about the uncertainty for staff , or would you say that 's an issue for the university itself ? Kirsty Williams AM : These are autonomous bodies . They have to act accordingly , in compliance with any employment law or any statutory responsibilities that they would have as an employer . That 's not a matter for me ; that is a matter for the institution that is an autonomous body . Hefin David AM : But I would be surprised if you were n't keeping an eye on this , given that it has been a key provider . Are you aware of when the appeal decision will be known ? Kirsty Williams AM : My understanding is that the appeals process is ongoing , and next month , perhaps . But as I said , this is a process that is independent of Government— Hefin David AM : But it will have an impact for what you do . Kirsty Williams AM : It will potentially change the nature of the people from whom we commission places , but as I said , I do not have any concerns that we will not be in a position to commission the appropriate number of training places that we will need as a result of our planning . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . Suzy on this—mindful of what the Minister said about it being an independent decision . Suzy Davies AM : It 's not directly about USW ; it 's about the geographic spread of provision . I wonder if you could just give us a snapshot of what that looks like , and whether you think—certainly for PGCE or postgrad courses , anyway—that if they 're not accessible geographically and we 've got students who already have three years ' worth of debt , they 're not going to be looking to , necessarily , live away from home for a fourth year , and may want to study nearer home . Has there been any research done on the access to these postgrad courses , about where people are coming from and whether that 's had an impact on the fact that some of these places have n't been filled ? Kirsty Williams AM : Currently , with our current providers , there is a significant geographical spread . There are centres here in the south-east , there are centres in the south-west , in mid Wales , and in north Wales . Obviously , accessibility is an issue for us . We do think that , for some students , accessibility is an issue , and of course that 's why we are responding with our part-time PGCE route , which actually will be location neutral , because you will be able to study that as a distance learner , and so you will be able to remain in your community and undertake that course . So , that 's part of the attractiveness , I believe , of offering that to people . So , if geographical disadvantage is stopping somebody from pursuing a career aspiration to qualify as a teacher , our new part-time PGCE , as I said , will allow them to do that . Suzy Davies AM : Okay . Thanks , Chair . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . We 're going to move on now to talk about reform and reconfiguration of the post-16 education sector . Janet Finch-Saunders . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you . Good morning . There are some encouraging provisional signs regarding the demand for part-time undergraduate study for the first year of Diamond , but the £12.5 million reduction Higher Education Funding Council for Wales is having to make this academic year has potentially placed the funding for part-time provision under pressure . Is there a danger that , without maintaining and growing this funding , Welsh Government will undermine the Diamond reforms and increase the cost of part-time courses ? Kirsty Williams AM : Let 's be absolutely clear what this Government has done for part-time students . We are unique , Janet : unique in the UK and , I believe , unique in Europe , in the parity of the support that is available for full-time and part-time students . So , Welsh part-timers have something that they do not get if they are in England or if they 're in Scotland . It 's too early to have definitive figures for the impact of Diamond on the number of people who are undertaking part-time study . I do n't want to get into trouble by not having that verified data , and I know Members get testy with me for anecdotal evidence , but I can tell you this : there is one provider that is reporting at this moment a 40 per cent increase in the number of students that are registered to start part-time study with them this year , as compared to last year , and that reflects really , really well , compared to the onward downward trend that we see across the border for part-time . What this means , for us as a nation , is that people are able to take this opportunity to upskill themselves and to be able to develop their qualifications and to be able to move themselves up career ladders , and I think that 's such an important economic factor for us . So , rather than feeling doom and gloom about the prospects for the part-time sector , the early indications , at least , show that the Diamond reforms are leading to an increase in demand and , more importantly , an increase in uptake—students taking advantage of that system to go away and study . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you . Is the Welsh Government able to reassure the committee that its ambitions for the post-compulsory education and training reforms are still in line with the original Hazelkorn recommendations , and go beyond the Labour manifesto commitment of simply replacing HEFCW with a new funding body for HE and FE ? Kirsty Williams AM : Okay . So , you will be aware , Janet , that the agreement between myself and the First Minister that brought me into the Government and the Government 's programme state very clearly about our desire to pursue the recommendations of the Hazelkorn report . I hope , by the end of this week , we will have published the responses to the technical consultation , and we will continue to move forward . And I would argue , certainly , that the reforms that we are intending to implement do go beyond just simply a body that replaces HEFCW and joins in FE . It 's a much wider remit to the potential new commission . And , as I said , I believe we 've had in the region of about 450 responses to the technical consultation and I 'm pleased to say that there remains a consensus—we will always have some arguments about the details—but there remains a consensus on the direction of travel that we are pursuing . A summary of the consultation responses will be available to Members and will be published by the end of the week . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Okay . Is the Welsh Government still committed to introducing the PCET Bill before the end of the fifth Assembly , and are you confident this will happen ? Kirsty Williams AM : Well , I 'm absolutely determined that we will get the PCET legislation on the floor . It 's a substantial piece of work , as you 've just alluded to . This goes just beyond abolishing a single body . So , it is a substantial piece of work , but I believe that we are on track to be able to do that by the end of this term . But it 's a big piece of work . Lynne Neagle AM : Llyr , on this . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Can I just pick up on that ? I mean , it is going to be a big job , and , clearly , there 's a strong focus on creating the commission and putting the structures in place , but , of course , one of the drivers is that we want to effect a cultural change in the way that people perceive post-16 education . This thing about parity of esteem and all that kind of agenda . And a key part of this process , therefore , is the vision that people are waiting for . When are we going to see this coming forward ? Because I think we 're putting structures in place , so there 's a big discussion about the technical stuff , but I feel there 's a bit of a vacuum in terms of the vision . Kirsty Williams AM : Well , I would disagree with you , Llyr , because— Llyr Gruffydd AM : Right , okay . Well , maybe you should have come to the cross-party group on further education last night . Kirsty Williams AM : Well , I would disagree with you because , of course , the technical consultation has followed what we had last year , which was a consultation on the vision , on what we needed to do to bring the sector together beyond just HE and FE , to the inclusion of sixth forms ; work-based learning providers ; apprenticeships ; and bringing all of that together under one body . I believe that that gives us an opportunity to have better strategic planning ; to help us prevent duplication ; to help us bridge gaps that are not available for learners at the moment . It will , hopefully— . My vision is that it will promote collaboration between institutions rather than simply having the market-based process that we see in other places where there 's competition rather than collaboration . I want to see it strengthen links between schools , FE and HE , strengthen links between schools and employers and business , to make sure that we 've got better information and advice services so that young people know what their pathways are and can make really informed choices about what 's best for them , to help them make them . So , I think : we 've done the vision , we 're now doing the technical consultation , that will be published by the end of the week , and we 'll move forward with our overarching vision that Hazelkorn elaborated and that we are now taking forward . Llyr Gruffydd AM : So , you would be very concerned if FE institutions were saying that we really need to see the vision , that that 's the next step , that we really need to understand the vision . Kirsty Williams AM : But , I 've met— . As I said , I was with one of our excellent FE leaders just at the end of last week ; it was n't raised with me then . I do understand that there are concerns from the FE sector about will the vision be realised . I think there 's a shared understanding of the vision , but I understand and I do see some nervousness about , actually , in the end , will this just be HEFCW by another name , and , the opportunity for FE , will this be realised in this new body ? We need to keep ensuring that , as we go forward and develop the policy , and as we develop , eventually , the legislation , that that parity of esteem and that true equality across all parts of the sector is realised . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you very much . Our next questions are from Michelle Brown . Michelle Brown AM : Good morning , Cabinet Secretary ; good morning , Minister . Your paper to the committee says that there 's a need for more analysis and research into the outcomes for learners from different backgrounds . At the same time , Welsh universities have declared £104 million towards equality and opportunity activity for 2018 . If you do n't have the analysis , how can you be sure that the investment that 's being made by the Welsh universities is actually going to have a positive outcome in the right places and lead to better outcomes for underrepresented groups ? Kirsty Williams AM : Okay . Well , of course , that would be one of the duties of the new commission set up as a result of our post-compulsory education and training reforms that I would anticipate . The universities are required , under the Higher Education ( Wales ) Act 2015 , to produce fee and access statements , and the £104 million that they have to take off their fees to be able to promote this work—those fee and access plans have to be signed off by the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales as being robust and truly promoting equality of opportunity . They 're also there to promote access and the opportunities for people to aspire to higher education . We are looking at— . It 's quite early days , still , for that new regulatory regime to come through , so we ask HEFCW , when I meet with HEFCW , about the adequacy of those plans . Equity is an important part of my approach to higher education . That 's why we 're introducing the Diamond reforms—so that those from the poorest backgrounds can be adequately financially supported and are not put off from going to a university . And we 're also looking— . I would envisage under PCET a better mechanism of tracking destinations for learners . So , for instance , in the FE sector , we 're introducing new joint monitoring for outcomes for sixth-form learners and FE learners , because we 've never tracked them in the same way . So , we 're introducing that now so that we can see the destinations for those two sectors , but the PCET reforms give us an opportunity to do that right across the board . Huw , is there anything else I need to add ? Huw Morris : Well , I 'd just reinforce the point the Cabinet Secretary made about the fee and access plans being the vehicle through which we get universities to specify what they 're going to do , and the funding council tracks that . To make sure that we 're doing that in a full and appropriate manner , periodically , we ask for that system to be reviewed . I think it was in 2017 that the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research , Data and Methods—the research arm of Cardiff University—reviewed the system and looked at how widening access was being promoted by different institutions and whether that was working in all parts of Wales . The report from that group was considered by one of the sub-committees in HEFCW and they are revising the process as a consequence . So , I think we can be confident that there are ambitious targets that are monitored , and , periodically , the system as a whole is reviewed . Michelle Brown AM : Can you tell us what sort of research and data the universities are basing those access plans on ? I assume they 'll all have slightly different methods—I appreciate that—but can you give us any idea of how they actually formulate these access plans ? Huw Morris : So , there are data collected across the UK by a body called the Higher Education Statistics Agency . They produce detailed breakdowns , along with UCAS , of where applicants come from , which institutions did they study at , what courses , what their particular characteristics are , including their socioeconomic status , and that data is then analysed at a UK level and in Wales , through HEFCW and its agents , to track what 's happening at different institutions at different stages , not just in terms of who 's applying and who gets access , but who progresses and what happens to people once they 've graduated . Michelle Brown AM : So , there is already data there . I 'm just wondering how that data that 's already there differs from the research and analysis that you were talking about in your paper . They must be different , then . What specific analysis and research were you referring to in your paper ? Kirsty Williams AM : We use the HESA— . It is HESA , is n't it ? Huw Morris : Yes . Kirsty Williams AM : That 's shorthand—the HESA data , and institutions use that . We also then use WISERD and other organisations to supplement that piece of work . I think there is a challenge to some of this going forward . So , the Office for Students in England now is having some discussions about access to HESA data . This is a source of real concern to me , that Welsh institutions may not be able to have the ready access to that data because of changes the OfS may be making . So , we supplement where we think that there 's value to be added in additional breakdowns , or in additional slicing of data and understanding of what is motivating people to come forward . Huw Morris : And to give you a specific example of that as it applies in north Wales— . So , take a university like Wrexham Glyndŵr University ; they have quite a large intake of mature students . The data that 's collected and analysed at a UK level tends to look at people who are going into university at a young age , not a mature profile . So , some of the analysis that we do in Wales—indeed , the deliberations of the sub-committee that I spoke about earlier—is about how do we make sure that those differences in Wales are reflected in the data and reflected in the targets that are set . Michelle Brown AM : Okay . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . The next questions are from Hefin David . Hefin David AM : Cabinet Secretary , are you in favour of more university mergers ? Kirsty Williams AM : I would n't use the word 'agnostic ' , but what I 'm in favour of is a healthy , strong and sustainable HE sector . If individual institutions wish to collaborate or , indeed , go further to a formal merger then , obviously , that is a matter for them . We 're not pursuing or urging a policy of mergers , but , if individual institutions feel that is of benefit to them and their students , obviously , we would have an interest in that and making sure that they were robust plans , but that 's a matter for individual institutions . Hefin David AM : But HEFCW are pushing it . Kirsty Williams AM : Well , again , what HEFCW are interested in is a sustainable HE sector that is strong but , as I said , I do not have a burning desire or a set policy to try and pursue mergers . Hefin David AM : Okay . That 's a little bit of a contrast with your predecessors , then . Kirsty Williams AM : Well , that 's a matter for them . Hefin David AM : Okay . The reason I say it is because I was kind of on the inside when Cardiff Metropolitan University was under pressure from the then Minister to merge with the University of Glamorgan and Newport . It was a very difficult time for staff and , indeed , for students . You had the University and College Union and the Minister pushing it ; the vice-chancellor of Cardiff Met at the time very much against it . So , do you think that it 's really— ? You 're agnostic , but do you think perhaps it 's not worth the disruption that can occur to staff and students ? Kirsty Williams AM : As I said , Hefin , I have no formal policy for reconfiguration or mergers . That 's not to say I do n't believe in collaboration between institutions . Going back to the issue of ITE , a very interesting programme came forward from Cardiff Met and Cardiff University for their ITE provision . So , I 'm all for universities and institutions working together , but there 's no formal policy . These are autonomous institutions . If they see that there is an advantage—I would hope for the student first , and , if we put the student at the front of this process , then we would obviously have an interest in that and making sure that that was the right thing to do . But , certainly , there is no pressure from us as a Government to pursue an agenda of mergers . Hefin David AM : Just to be clear , then , that 's likely to be a policy for the foreseeable future as well ; you 're not going to change that view . Kirsty Williams AM : I have no intentions at this stage , but 'Events , dear boy ' . [ Laughter . ] You know , sometimes there may be a situation that I can not foresee at this moment that would necessitate , for the benefit of students , the benefit of Wales , a merger . So , never say never , but , at this point in time , I do not foresee us changing that policy . Lynne Neagle AM : Julie on this . Julie Morgan AM : Yes , just looking back at that time , which I remember very vividly— Hefin David AM : So do I . Julie Morgan AM : I had many meetings with Cardiff Met . Do you feel there has been any disadvantage to Cardiff Met because that merger did n't go ahead ? Kirsty Williams AM : I , personally , am not aware of any disadvantage to Cardiff Met , but I would recognise—I would absolutely recognise—for staff and students caught up in those deliberations and those issues , then that would have had a personal impact on them . In terms of the institution going forward , I 'm not aware that they are currently struggling with any disadvantage from that discussion . And , as I said , I 'm really heartened by some of the really interesting collaborative work that Cardiff Met are interested in doing , and new partnerships and new collaborations between institutions , whether that be Cardiff Uni or local colleges , and I think that 's to be welcomed . Julie Morgan AM : So , following on from what Hefin said , was it worth all the fuss ? Kirsty Williams AM : Well , look , as it 's turned out , we have a strong institution in Cardiff Met , and I think , rather than looking at the past , we need to look at the future . But , of course , there was some reconfiguration and we need to understand any lessons that arose out of reconfiguration , and HEFCW are currently doing some work , actually , to look at reconfiguration , the experience of reconfiguration that did happen , and were benefits realised and what are the lessons that can be learned from that process . So , they are doing a piece of work to reflect , and that will , perhaps , help inform us as we go forward . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , Hefin . Hefin David AM : I 'd just say—Julie Morgan was one of our heroes at the time , I 've got to say . Eluned Morgan AM : She always is . Hefin David AM : And still is . If I turn that on its head and have a look at University of South Wales , one of the concerns I 'm getting from former colleagues and staff is that the Newport aspect—because it was a merger between Newport and the University of Glamorgan—has been somewhat denuded by the merger , and the amount of activity in the new Newport campus and elsewhere in Newport has been reduced by the merger . Are you aware of those concerns that staff may have ? Kirsty Williams AM : As I said , it 's not for me to second-guess the judgment of previous Ministers who pursued— Hefin David AM : But it 's happening now , I mean . Kirsty Williams AM : —a particular policy agenda . With regard to Newport , we are aware of concerns . Obviously , one campus closed completely , and there are concerns about the level of activity at the new campus . And we continue to discuss with the University of South Wales and the local FE college what offer is available to the local population , but also the wider contribution that that institution can make to the rest of Wales , and we continue to have conversations with both the college and the university about utilisation of the facilities in Newport and opportunities that could be made available in Newport . Hefin David AM : That 's interesting , because that 's the first time I 've heard it confirmed from the Government that those concerns that have been raised by former staff and colleagues in Newport are actually echoed by yourself , then . Kirsty Williams AM : Well , as I said , we 're aware of them . We take our time to listen to people . When people raise issues with us , we take them seriously . Clearly , going back to the point that I believe Suzy made about geographical coverage , we want to make sure that FE and HE opportunities are available for people throughout Wales , and we continue to work with providers in that area to explore what can be done to enhance the opportunities . Hefin David AM : And , from a financial point of view , they had £25 million for the merger . Are you satisfied that 's value for money , and , at this point in the 10-year plan , that things are going as they should , with incomes being squeezed across the sector ? Kirsty Williams AM : Yes . I mean , it 's difficult , is n't it , to second-guess what would have happened , what might have happened , if the merger had n't gone ahead , around the financial stability and sustainability of an institution . How do you prove that , if that had n't happened , something worse or something better might have happened ? It 's difficult to do that and to second-guess those judgments , but , as I 've said , what I am interested in— . And I ca n't change that decision that was made by a previous Minister—it was n't my decision—but what I can do is to ensure that any lessons learnt , any evaluation of that particular set of circumstances , can be looked at and can help inform future policy , which is why HEFCW is doing the piece of work . When that 's published , you and I will be in a better position to understand whether the aspirations of that particular merger were realised , not realised , and if we were in that situation again , could we do it better next time ? Hefin David AM : Okay , so you 'll reflect on that later . At this point in time , you do n't have any concerns about the long-term sustainability of the University of South Wales . Kirsty Williams AM : No , not at this point . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . Janet . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you . The Welsh Government 's draft outline budget for 2019 states that it will continue to provide £20 million to further and higher education in 2019-20 . Can you outline how this will be allocated between HE and FE and if conditions will be attached to the funding ? Kirsty Williams AM : Janet , you will have to wait until the end of the month , when the detailed , main expenditure group by main expenditure group lines of the budget are published , otherwise I will be stealing the finance Minister 's thunder . There is a process by which the Welsh Government 's budget is dealt with , and those details will emerge later on this month . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . Kirsty Williams AM : But can I just say on conditions— ? You will be aware that there are conditions attached to Government spend , both in the FE sector and in the HE sector . Those budgets will be subject to those existing arrangements ; so , for instance , in the HE sector , the remit letter to HEFCW . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . We're— Llyr Gruffydd AM : Can I just pick up on funding , generally ? Sorry . Because , we did talk about HEFCW and part-time funding earlier , and I 'm not sure that we addressed the issue of this £12.5 million cut in a specific budget line from HEFCW , because what they 've done , if I understand correctly , is that they 've put four priorities into one budget line , which includes part-time teaching , and cut that budget line by £12.5 million . Are you not concerned that that 'll have an impact on part-time teaching , given that it 's such a success story that you 're proud of ? Kirsty Williams AM : HEFCW have to take cognisance of the remit letter , but then , ultimately , they are free to allocate resources as they see fit . What will drive part-time provision is the students taking it up , and universities responding to that desire and that need within their institutions . So , at this moment , I do n't have any concerns . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . We 're going to move on now to look at the parity of esteem between academic and vocational post-16 education . The first question is from Michelle . Michelle Brown AM : Thank you , Chair . Welsh Government wants to achieve parity of esteem between academic and vocational education , and I think that 's a very laudable aim . Higher apprenticeships are a key part of this , but Estyn 's recent inspection found that only four providers from 17 were achieving good outcomes for learners . What action do you propose to take about this , to make sure that those learners have much better outcomes across the board ? Eluned Morgan AM : First of all , just to make it clear that that is very much our intention . I think we have got work to do to make sure that we do reach that parity of esteem , but let 's be clear that , in relation to these higher level apprenticeships , we were concerned that , actually , we were n't doing as well , perhaps , as we should be , which is why we commissioned Estyn to look at this specifically , and what it was that we were doing well , and what we needed to improve on . One of the things that we found is that we are doing very well in relation to foundation courses in terms of attainment—we 've got 83 per cent attainment levels—but if you look at that at higher level apprenticeships , then we 've got 77 per cent , so what is going wrong there ? But , also , it 's worth underlining the fact that , actually , we 're still miles ahead of England , who are only reaching levels of about 61 per cent . So , we 're already doing much better than England , but we 're ambitious , and we want to make sure that if we are serious about this parity of esteem , how do we get there if we 're not offering the kind of quality that we 'd like to see in those higher level apprenticeships ? So , some of the recommendations in that report , we 'll be taking up . We want to increase the number of new employers and mentors within the system . I think we 're also very keen to make sure that people do n't repeat learning that they 've already done . That 's a danger and it takes up too much time . So , there are lots of these recommendations that now we 'll set in motion , and I think the important thing for us then is to understand that , in relation to who 's doing well and who 's not doing well in the FE sector , the bulk of where that finance goes is actually doing quite well . It 's pushing some of the private sector providers where we need to actually make sure that the quality is where we want it to be , and is , very importantly , matching the needs of employers . So , we 've constantly got to be looking at the courses : are they responding to the needs of the market and what employers are looking for ? And that means revising the offer sometimes in terms of the courses . Michelle Brown AM : Where are the difficulties arising— ? You refer to difficulties arising with the private providers . What are those difficulties ? Eluned Morgan AM : Well , some of it is about , perhaps , not giving the kind of guidance that we 'd like them to give in-house . So , they 're perhaps not doing the kind of on-the-job work that we 'd like them to do . So , I think it 's making sure that , when they 're in the workplace , they are still being pushed to attain those levels . But I think it 's clear that what we need to do is to also listen to what the advisory board that we 've set up in relation to apprenticeships is also asking us , and we 've got the Confederation of British Industry advising us on that as well . Michelle Brown AM : Do you have a service level agreement with the private providers ? Eluned Morgan AM : Yes . I mean , the whole thing is under a tender procedure , obviously , and we will be revising that soon . There 'll be a new apprenticeship procurement process that we 'll be undergoing and starting to look at that process next year . So , there 's an opportunity there for us to drive change in the system . Michelle Brown AM : Would you be willing to share the targets under the SLA with the committee ? Eluned Morgan AM : Well , I think the— . I ca n't see that there 'd be a problem with that , so I 'm sure we could do that , but I think the way to make people move , quite often , is through making sure that you put the finances where they need to be , and then they 're likely to shift . And , so , I think , in responding to this Estyn report , we can then build that into the next framework . Michelle Brown AM : Okay , thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . Julie . Julie Morgan AM : Yes , thank you . Right , I wanted to ask about the investment . If we 're going to get parity of esteem , we 've got to , probably , get more investment in . Could you say why there is n't more investment in degree , and there does n't seem to be any investment in Master's-level apprenticeships at universities ? Eluned Morgan AM : Well , I think we 've got to be careful that what happens is that the state does n't pick up what , currently , people are prepared to pay for themselves , and , so , we 've got to just make sure that that balance is right . So , what 's happened in England , for example , is lots of people who were previously sitting Master of business administration courses , for example , are now switching into apprenticeship programmes . So , the system—it means that , previously , they were prepared to pay and now the state is paying or the employer 's playing it in a slightly different way . So , I think we 've got to just be aware about how—making sure that we do n't get employers passing that responsibility that , actually , they have to upskill and to uptrain their workers and pass it back on to the state , whereas , actually , they need to step up as well as employers . Julie Morgan AM : So , how are you going to judge that ? How are you going to tell when , maybe , you should start putting some money in ? Eluned Morgan AM : Well , what we are doing is we 're putting money into areas where we know there are skills shortages . So , we 're focusing where we want those apprenticeships—and particularly at the higher level—to be . So , for example , we 're looking at ICT ; we 're looking at construction . There are areas where we definitely need to be focusing our attention . So , that 's where we 'll be prioritising our funding , and that 's what we 're doing already . Kirsty Williams AM : And that 's for degree-level apprenticeships , not Master 's . Just degree-level apprenticeships . Julie Morgan AM : Right , thank you . And then , in terms of getting data , could you clarify the progress on developing outcome and destination data for higher apprenticeships ? Your plan seems to suggest that data wo n't be available until 2020-21 , at the end of the programme . Eluned Morgan AM : And that 's because we 're only just starting on this , and it takes a long time for people to complete an apprenticeship . So , we wo n't have anybody going from the higher level apprenticeship into a destination until around 2021 , so there 's no point in measuring that until that point . Julie Morgan AM : Right . And then , can you tell us when you 'll publish Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol 's new operational plan to develop post-16 Welsh-medium provision , which was presented during July , and clarify if the plan requires additional funding ? Eluned Morgan AM : So , there is a report that was published in July , and we are waiting for the operational actions from that report to be published , probably within the next month . In terms of the implementation of that programme , some of that journey has already begun , so they 're not waiting for the report to— . We 're not waiting for the actions to be very clearly set out ; actually , some of that work has been done . For example , already , there 's been a review of the governance . We 're also looking at the kind of research that needs to be done in that area . I think what 's clear , and something that 's very much driving me as the Welsh language Minister , is this understanding that you reach 16 and you get this fall off a cliff in terms of the number of people who actually speak and use Welsh . So , that 's the thing that we need to address , and that 's why moving now into that area of further education is crucial . And the report , written by Delyth Evans , did suggest that we do need to move into this area but , actually , there was n't necessarily a need for further funding in that area . But it may be something that we will consider , but it 's something that we 'll try and absorb , perhaps , from within the department . Kirsty Williams AM : A relatively modest amount of money was being made available this year to be able to kick-start some of this work , but we are mindful of the recommendations from the Evans report . So , future allocations will have to reflect the priorities within the implementation plan , and that 's not just money that goes directly to y coleg , but also trying to get better alignment between other budget lines that support the Welsh language , and making sure that all budget lines that could help on this agenda are aligned to the recommendations and the implementation report . Julie Morgan AM : Thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Suzy , on this . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you . Just on coleg cenedlaethol 's extended remit , have you had— ? I have n't read the Evans report , but is there anything in there about the role of increased use of Welsh in adult community learning , for example ? That 's a further education pot , is n't it ? Eluned Morgan AM : Yes , it is , and we are very much in touch with adult community learning , and they are aware of the responsibilities they have in relation to the Welsh language . The issue , of course , with adult education , is that they have undergone some quite dramatic cuts . Suzy Davies AM : Oh , yes , I do n't mean the higher education sector that 's taken over responsibility for this ; I 'm talking about community learning , low level , just having Welsh there . And , you know , as you mentioned yourself , post 16 , people stop using it , so getting it in wherever you can as part of a strategy . Eluned Morgan AM : Yes . They 're aware of that responsibility and we— Suzy Davies AM : They 're free to choose partners , then , are they , to help them deliver that ? Eluned Morgan AM : And also to work with the new organisation that we 've set up to promote the learning of Welsh , in particular , that is based in Carmarthen . So , that 's something also that 's being driven , and they 're working closely , I think , on this . Suzy Davies AM : Oh , great , thanks . Kirsty Williams AM : There 's lots of innovative practice . So , for instance , up in Wrexham , if a student has gone into the college to do A-levels , then they may decide to do those A-levels through the medium of English . But if they were previously in a Welsh-medium school , they are actively encouraged—indeed , persuaded—to do their Welsh baccalaureate through the medium of Welsh . So , they may be doing their A-levels in English , but if they 've come from a Welsh-medium school , the college proactively seeks them out and makes sure that there is provision for them to do their Welsh bac qualification through the medium of Welsh , or , for instance , they are working very hard to form tutor groups . So , the tutor group—you might be doing your qualifications in English , but your tutor group will be a Welsh-medium tutor group , so that you are placed with other students who have come from Welsh-medium schools , and your tutor does all that tutor work through the medium of Welsh . So , there are other ways in which we can continue to help support children 's linguistic ability , even if they have made a decision not to formally study their A-levels , for instance , or a course , through the medium of Welsh , and we 're constantly looking at new ways . I think one particular aspect of the market—if we call it that word—that we 're interested in are those students who 've been to Welsh-medium schools , but at 16 , perhaps , as I say , decide to go to a college . So , for instance , here in Cardiff , looking at childcare , and the opportunity—you know , there 's a sector where we know we need a Welsh-medium workforce . Suzy Davies AM : Yes , definitely . Kirsty Williams AM : So , again , it 's trying to target those children , and track them from a previous Welsh-medium education into a college , capturing their language skills , and finding ways in which they can use them . Merthyr college—there 's a Welsh-medium champion in Merthyr college actively looking for children who have come from a Welsh-medium background , and they are allocated roles as Welsh-medium champions within the college , to promote . So , there are lots of innovative ways , especially in the FE sector , that they 're looking to keep children 's linguistic skills relevant , and they 're using them , even if they make that decision to switch the language of their tuition . Suzy Davies AM : Well , that 's encouraging to hear . My question was about community learning , where it 's essentially older people who perhaps are coming back to education in a way that was n't as formal as it was before , if I can put it like that—so we do n't lose sight of them as well . I 've still got an abiding worry that there 's a cohort in the middle here of people who we might lose , and maybe pass on bad attitudes towards the Welsh language to their children , despite the fact that those children now have huge opportunities to absorb Welsh language skills and make the most of them . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . The next questions are from Llyr . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Thank you , Chair . I 'd like to ask about the regional skills partnership—partnerships , I should say—because they are having a direct influence now on courses and provision in FE , and with degree apprenticeships in universities as well . You , I believe , received the Graystone review back in March , so could you tell us a bit about what was in it , and what the recommendations are ? Eluned Morgan AM : So , some of the recommendations— . So , we wanted to review it because it 's still relatively new . They 've only been up and running about two or three years . He brought out some positives—things that we , I think , are doing well . I think they found that the voluntary partnership approach was quite effective . He did suggest that , actually , what they need to be producing is much shorter , sharper , focused reports . There was a suggestion of a lack of transparency , in terms of reporting from those regional skills partnerships , and that 's obviously something now that we 've undertaken to review . And there , I think , is an understanding that what we need to do now is to put in place those changes . But , on the whole , what we 've done is to reinforce our commitment to the regional skills partnerships , and in particular now , through allocating £10 million to further education colleges to respond directly to the wishes and the desires of the regional skills partnerships , you can see actually the status of the regional skills partnerships has just grown significantly . Because now there is an outcome as a result of their recommendations . So , you 've seen quite a dramatic shift , I think , in the respect for regional skills partnerships over the past year . Llyr Gruffydd AM : So , are there any recommendations in terms of governance as well— Eluned Morgan AM : Yes . Llyr Gruffydd AM : —because , clearly , there may have been concerns about the way that people ended up being members of the partnerships ? You touched on transparency—clearly , that 's an issue as well . So , just particularly on governance— . Eluned Morgan AM : So , on governance , I think there was an understanding that that needs to be looked at again , and that we need to get the right people around the table . And what is interesting is , I think , because it was a voluntary approach , because now people can see an outcome , we 're getting different people now really showing an interest in being a part of the regional skills partnerships . So , governance is something again we 're going to be addressing and following up the recommendations on in that Graystone review . Is there anything to add to that ? Huw Morris : Well , I was just going to say , I do n't see why we could n't share the review with you . Llyr Gruffydd AM : That was going to be my next question . Huw Morris : That might be helpful . And we are actioning the recommendations from that review . Llyr Gruffydd AM : The normal course of action would be , of course , to have published it and then to publish a Government response . Any reason why that was n't done ? I find it quite strange that you 're saying that you 're actually actioning the report and you still have n't published it . As a committee , we 've not been party to any of that , really . Eluned Morgan AM : I do n't see why that ca n't be done . There 's nothing to hide here , so why would n't we ? We 're the people who commissioned the report— Llyr Gruffydd AM : I 'm the one asking the questions . [ Laughter . ] No , but you 're right . I just find it strange . I just find it odd that that has n't been published . Eluned Morgan AM : Okay . Well , we 'll certainly get a copy of that to you . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Yes , okay . Huw Morris : May I just say : we ask a number of people periodically to comment on what we do , and agencies we work with do the same . The status of those reports varies . I do n't suppose we 'd anticipated there would be the interest in this issue that there is and so , as the Minister said , there 's no problem that I can see with that . Llyr Gruffydd AM : And do you have a timeline in terms of by when you want to introduce some of the reforms that you 're looking at now , because of this report ? Eluned Morgan AM : Some of them have already been introduced , so we 're not waiting . The transparency issue that I think there was a bit of concern about—that 's already been introduced . So , it 's just about making sure that people understand what is going on in these regional skills partnerships . I think that 's really important— Llyr Gruffydd AM : Well , quite , given the influence that they have now . Yes , sure . Just another short one on the regional skills partnerships , really : how effective are they in supporting the planning and delivery of Welsh-medium provision in post-16 ? Eluned Morgan AM : I think there 's more we can do in relation to that . But I think there are aspects where we 're already changing in respect of specific sectors . So , if you think about the care sector , for example , what we do need is more people who have those skills to speak through the medium of Welsh in the care sector . And , coming back to the point that was made earlier , what we 're doing now is looking at the curriculum : to what extent can we include— ? You do n't have to do your whole course through the medium of Welsh , but there are aspects that would be very useful . So , those kind of things are being taken on board now in terms of the courses . One of the things that the Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol are looking at is building the resources that will be needed in order to mainstream those into , in particular , those front-line service areas where we have a skills shortage . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Okay . Diolch . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . Cabinet Secretary , you know that this committee has taken a very keen interest in the emotional and mental health of our young people . In the summer , the English universities Minister made an announcement about the development of a new mental health charter . That followed some concerns about young people dying by suicide across the UK . Is Welsh Government expecting Welsh universities to sign up to that charter or are you planning to work on your own ? Kirsty Williams AM : Thank you for raising this . I think it 's really important that whilst for many , many , many young people moving away from home and starting their degree course is an incredibly exciting time and something they look forward to hugely , it can bring significant stresses with it , especially for first-year students , who , as I said , are moving away , perhaps are suddenly responsible for finances in a way they 've never been responsible for , for all the day-to-day living that perhaps they 've relied on other people to assist them with . So , it can be quite a stressful time . So , it is right that we look at how we can support health and well-being for students , especially mental health and mental resilience . So , I very much welcome the work on the mental health charter , and HEFCW are engaged and keeping a very close eye on what 's going on to see the opportunities for Welsh universities to participate in that . But this was on a recent agenda item that I had with HEFCW , and indeed with the vice-chancellors , when I met them last week , or the week before last . So , they are developing their own strategic approach to well-being and health for students , which will be underpinned by a co-created action plan with the universities themselves on supporting students with mental health problems in particular . So , the strategic approach and the action plan are being developed by HEFCW at the moment and HEFCW are also meeting with colleagues from England and Scotland to see the opportunities for a universal approach across the UK to supporting students . The universities , when I met with them recently , all shared a commitment to do better in this particular area . One , because it 's the right thing to do , but , actually , stopping people from dropping out and not completing their courses obviously is of a financial benefit to the institution . So , it 's actually the right thing to do for their students , they want to do it for that reason , but , actually , there is a strong financial underpinning to ensure that students complete their studies . So , it 's looking at , again , each university looking at individual approaches of how better they can do that . But it 's not just responding to students who become unwell , it's actually , 'What can we do to in the campus to maintain good mental health ? ' So , rather than just trying to fix a problem once it 's occurred , it 's 'What can we do ? ' And you 'll be aware of individual institutions taking different approaches . It 's not something that we dictate , but individual institutions—when they do exams , how work is assessed and marked and graded—are taking different steps to promote well-being , as well as then responding to situations where students become unwell . We do know that financial pressures can be a source of huge stress for students , so we are constantly working with the Student Loans Company to make sure that the services that they offer to people are as good as they can be , and that there are no unnecessary delays that , perhaps , put a student under pressure or give students worries about their financial situation . And I would argue our Diamond reforms , which allow students access to a living wage—for some students , completely by a grant , for some students , a combination of grant and loan , with no expectation at all that your parents will contribute , which is not the case in other places where there is an expectation of parental contribution—that actually , hopefully , addresses some of those financial worries that some students may have . But I am aware that if people are waiting for their grant or people are waiting for their payments , that can be a source of stress . So , ensuring that we have good performance by the Student Loans Company is crucial . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . And I 'm sure the committee 's very interested to hear the update on that . Are you able to give us any indication of timescale by which you 'd expect HEFCW and the individual universities to actually have this work in place ? Kirsty Williams AM : I 'm not sure , but I will write to the committee and let you know . In fact , we can probably provide , from Universities Wales and from the work that 's going on centrally , a list of proposals that are being undertaken . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you very much . The next question is from Dawn Bowden . Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you , Chair . I wanted to ask you about the pay dispute , and I know that you 're not the employer , because I know that 's going to be the first answer— Kirsty Williams AM : You 're right , that is the first answer . [ Laughter . ] Well anticipated . Dawn Bowden AM : But we are in a stalemate here and you clearly have an interest in making sure that this dispute is resolved quickly in the interest of the students and the reputation of the colleges et cetera , et cetera . I can see how this dispute has arisen . When we 've seen the teachers ' pay settlement , we 've seen FE settlements in England and Scotland higher than what's on the table here . And I am concerned , and I do think this is where the Welsh Government does have a role , because I am concerned that the employers seem to be using the funding issue as the reason not to have a reasonable settlement with staff . So , they 've walked away from the table , they 've said , 'One per cent , take it or leave it . Unless Welsh Government gives us any more money , that 's the end of that . ' And I 'm really concerned about that , because this is potentially going to have a major impact on whether we can recruit and retain staff in FE colleges . And I look at the college in my constituency , Merthyr college—it 's a tertiary college , they 're providing A-level education across Merthyr and they 're astounding results they 've been getting as well . I 'm coming round to the question in a moment . It 's really : what more do you think you can do as a Government to try to get these parties back round the table and not allow the dispute to become a political football ? Eluned Morgan AM : Thanks very much for that . I think , first of all , you 're absolutely right—this is about ColegauCymru 's negotiation , but we are keeping a close eye on the situation . I think it 's probably worth emphasising that the reason this has come about , or part of the reason , is because you 've seen that pay settlement in relation to teachers ' pay and we 've had the consequential . So , sixth-form teachers are happy . The people actually providing the same teaching course in a different institution , you can understand why they may say , 'Something needs to change here . ' The problem here is that it 's about that , actually , that falls to the Welsh Government . We do n't have that . Or at least it falls to FE colleges to fund that , and it 's up to them to come up with that proposal . We are keeping a close eye on things . I think it 's fair to say that we 'll wait until they get further along down the line , but we are extremely aware of the sensitivities of the situation . Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you for that , Minister . When you say you 're keeping a close eye on it , have you actually had conversations with ColegauCymru ? Because I note what you just said there : 'We 'll keep an eye on it and wait and see what 's happening . ' Well , all the unions are currently consulting . One has already balloted for industrial action . We could have the other unions also balloting for industrial action . I mean , this is n't something we want in the FE sector , clearly , so is there anything more proactive that Government could actually be doing to try to bring a resolution to this dispute ? Eluned Morgan AM : Well , we are listening and speaking to ColegauCymru , and also we 're aware of what the unions are saying as well . So , I think that 's probably as far as we can go at this point . When they come to a conclusion , and when they come to us and say , 'Look , this is the consequence and this will finish'—at this point , we have no idea where that settlement is likely to fall . Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you , Chair . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . Llyr . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Yes , thank you . Yes , we would n't expect you to make an announcement on this , because it 's happening outside of Government , but there is a principle here , is n't there , in terms of pay equality between schoolteachers and FE ? So , would you not wish to see a situation where we do have greater equality in that respect ? Eluned Morgan AM : In relation to teaching , I think it 's fair to say that we would wish to see pay equality in relation to teaching , yes . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Okay , thank you . You emphasise 'in relation to teaching'—my next question is that , of course , within FE establishments you have teaching staff and non-teaching staff , and if there was to be some sort of increase , then would you not expect all staff to have that ? Eluned Morgan AM : Well , let 's see—that 's up to ColegauCymru to negotiate and to discuss , so let 's see what the outcomes are . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Because some of the non-teaching staff are the lowest paid , as well , are n't they ? So , you know— . Eluned Morgan AM : Let 's wait for the outcome of the negotiations . I think we are very aware of the situation . ColegauCymru are in that negotiation . We 're aware of what the requests are from the trade union members , and we 'll wait to see what they come up with before responding formally . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Could I just briefly as well ask about pensions , because that 's coming down the line , potentially , is n't it , and the impact that 's going to have on FE ? One college was saying it will cost them £1 million if it happens next year . Are you thinking about any steps that you could take to support them , potentially , because obviously this is coming down the line , really , is n't it ? Eluned Morgan AM : Well , I think , already , we 've got the situation in relation to teachers , and again what we 've seen is the consequential and the UK Government honouring that . Again , what we do n't have , necessarily , is that money coming down from the UK Government for us to be able to support it in the way that we might like to . It 's early days on this , but it 's something , again , we 're keeping an eye on . Llyr Gruffydd AM : The fundamental question , really , is : if the money does n't come down the line from Westminster , are you in a position to underwrite that ? Eluned Morgan AM : Well , we 'll wait until we see that situation arising , but we 're aware that that is an issue that we 're going to have to deal with in future . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Diolch . Lynne Neagle AM : In relation to the pay dispute , it 's the committee 's understanding that ColegauCymru 's position is that , in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers , an additional 3.5 per cent or £10.1 million is needed . Are you aware of that being their position ? Eluned Morgan AM : We are aware of their position , yes . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . The final question is from Hefin David . Hefin David AM : You will have had , Cabinet Secretary , a letter from Professor Colin Riordan on 26 September regarding essay mills , in which he refers to the other letter that was sent by him and 39 vice-chancellors regarding essay mills and the fact that it 's legalised cheating . In the letter—it was actually to me—that was copied to you , he says : 'We have requested the UK Government commission the QAA to publish a draft Bill by or before the beginning of the next parliamentary session . We 've also requested the Department for Education give support to the establishment of a UK centre for academic integrity , which would research , analyse and combat academic misconduct . Any support that the Welsh Government can provide in this regard will also be appreciated , so I 'm copying this letter to the Cabinet Secretary for Education . ' Can you just give me your opinions on that , please ? Kirsty Williams AM : I think 'legalised cheating ' is a polite way of describing what goes on . My officials have been in touch with their counterparts in the UK Government to see if we can co-ordinate a UK approach , which I think is necessary . I do n't think there 's any merit in us trying to do this on our own ; it would be pointless . I hope that we can agree a formal approach as quickly as possible , and I will take every opportunity— . We 're trying to establish a meeting with the UK Minister for HE before Christmas , and I will take every opportunity that I can to ensure that we can take some very , very strong action in this regard . But it does have to be done at a UK level . I want people who attend our universities and who work hard to achieve the grades that they get not to be disadvantaged by people who look to find an easy way out and are not willing to put— . I think it undermines the individual effort of individual students who are doing the right things , as well as the integrity of our system . I 'm proud of the quality of the system that we have in the Welsh HE sector , and I want that maintained . I hope that we can agree a UK approach to ending this practice . Hefin David AM : Okay . And in addition to the specifics regarding the quality assurance agency and the proposed centre for academic integrity , let 's be clear : what we 're talking about it outlawing those websites that offer to write essays for cash . Kirsty Williams AM : Yes . And quite often , very bad ones as well . [ Laughter . ] My understanding is— Hefin David AM : Well , they get through the system and they guarantee— . The websites , and I 've experienced this , and I mentioned it in First Minister 's questions— Kirsty Williams AM : You did . Hefin David AM : The websites say to you , 'Unless you tell anyone , you wo n't get caught ' , and students are believing that . The new student grant system—some of that money will go to these websites . Kirsty Williams AM : Absolutely , and , unlike you , I have no experience of this myself— Hefin David AM : Well , I have experience of it . I 've not done it , but I 've experienced it . [ Laughter . ] Kirsty Williams AM : I 'm so old , Hefin , that such internet sites did n't exist when I was a student . [ Laughter . ] But , you know , I 'm sure you listened to it too : a recent article , on a radio station , where , actually , it was an experiment just like you did—a student deliberately went through this process to expose , but , actually , what they got in return was n't even very good . It was a particularly poor essay on the portrayal of women in Victorian literature , so they were n't even getting very good value for their money . [ Laughter . ] But , clearly , this is a terrible and abhorrent practice in our system , and , as I said , I will do everything that I can to work with colleagues across the United Kingdom to find a solution to this . If I thought it would help if we did it on our own , we could do that , but it wo n't help if we act unilaterally . It has to be a UK approach . Hefin David AM : And just—final question—with regard to the representations you 've made , do you feel that the UK Government is open to this course of action ? Kirsty Williams AM : Well , officials are the ones who have had those direct , face-to-face conversations , rather than me . I hope to do that when I meet the Minister , hopefully before Christmas . Huw , would you like to comment ? Huw Morris : We have n't had anything formally , but I understand from what I 've heard in England that there is an interest to do something . Whether that will take the form of a Bill in the timescale you 've outlined , I 'm not sure , but as the Minister said , we 'll be exploring that with officials through the ministerial meetings . Hefin David AM : Okay , thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . Are there any other questions from Members ? No . Okay . Well , can I thank you all for attending and for answering all our questions ? As usual , you 'll have a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting , but thank you very much for your time . Item 3 , then , is papers to note . Paper to note 1 is a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Education regarding eligibility criteria for free school meals . I 'd like to return briefly to that when we go into private . Paper to note 2 : a letter from the Minister for Children , Older People and Social Care on the Childcare Funding ( Wales ) Bill . Paper to note 3 : also from that Minister , which is his response to the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee on the Bill . And paper to note 4 : also a letter from that Minister to the Finance Committee on the Bill . And the final paper to note is from Mind Cymru regarding the task and finish group on a whole-school approach to mental health , and I will update Members on that when we go into private . Happy to note those ? Item 4 , then : can I propose , in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 , that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting ? Are Members content ? Thank you . 
Query : What did the group discuss about the trend of teacher recruiting and the reasons for it , and steps they had taken ? Kirsty Williams AM : Thank you , Suzy . I think , for this year 's intake , although we 're in touch with our providers , we 're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year 's intake for a couple of months . But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets . So , there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs . So , what we 're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class , so that , actually , Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher . You 'll be aware that we 've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year . We have looked at financial incentives . It 's not the whole answer , I think , to these issues , but it 's part of a mixture of things that we need to do . You 'll be aware that , for priority subjects , with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications , those financial incentives are now £20,000 a year . We 're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise . We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees , e-mailing them , sending them materials to ask them to consider ( 1 ) becoming a teacher , and ( 2 ) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales . We are now part of a full national programme of ITE recruitment , giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher . So , there 's a whole package of things we need to do . In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff , and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you for that answer . I can see there 's a lot of activity , but what exactly is it responding to ? Presumably , some research has been done about why people do n't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers . I ca n't believe it 's just about ITE , although this is very valuable , what you 're talking about . Is there something that 's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching is n't a profession they want to go into ? Is that something that 's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well ? Kirsty Williams AM : No . I think what you will find is that this is n't a uniquely Welsh issue . I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border , which proves to me that money is n't necessarily the entire answer , because , despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses , they 're not able to do that in England either . So , that proves to me—what the research does show—that it 's not money alone that will get people onto these courses . Interestingly , I do n't even think it 's a UK problem . Recently , as you 'll be aware via my written statement , I attended the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory , which is a system-to-system conference . If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world , the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention . In the USA , they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers . So , in the Californian system , significant teacher shortages , and in Oregon , Washington . I met with New York state—significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state , and in Finland , Australia . So , this is a common issue across the globe , really . That 's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner—it 's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off . One of the things that we have got strong performance in , and I think this is perhaps something that we 're trying to follow up on , are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status—so , those are people who are training on the job . Those remain strong . There 's high demand for those places , so much so that we 've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year , which says to me that—there 's definitely a place for the traditional , 'Take a year off , do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'—actually , that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching , which is why , of course , from next year , we will have our unique part-time PGCE route into qualification . So , that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities , so they can earn while they learn , or maybe they 've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course . I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools . So , there 's no one thing , I think , that we can do that will solve this issue . But it is an international issue , I agree with that . Suzy Davies AM : Okay . Well , that 's what I was after finding out , and , actually , what you 've just said about the part-time PGCE is pretty interesting as well , because if you can bring your outside world experience into teaching , that 's got to help , has n't it ? Kirsty Williams AM : Can I just agree with you ? I think that is really , really important—that we have a diversity in our teaching workforce . I think the different dynamic that brings to a school and the experience that brings to children is really , really valuable . I was up in the Deeside Sixth just last week , talking to the A-level chemistry teacher . She had been a teacher for a while , she 'd gone into industry , worked in industry , and now had come back into teaching . She said that she felt that that made her a better educator and she could talk with knowledge and experience about the opportunities outside of teaching that the students in front of her could pursue . I 'm very keen to increase the diversity in our teaching workforce and I 'm very keen in looking at career changers , who perhaps have different life experience and work experience , coming into our teaching profession . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you for that . Part of that diversity , of course—it would be great if you had more people interested in qualifying to teach through the medium of Welsh . Great aspirations ; the trend 's going the other way . No-one can solve this in 280 characters , I get that , but can you give us some indication about why you think this is proving still such an unattractive option when it 's clear that there 's a policy for this country to improve the number of Welsh speakers ? You 'd have thought there 'd be a pretty good carrot for this . Kirsty Williams AM : Sure . Again , data for recruitment for the 2018-19 cohort is not yet available and we are , as I said , keeping in touch with our ITE centres to keep a close eye on them . I think an important thing to recognise is that there is a difference between the number of people who are on courses where there is a specific designation that enables them to teach through the medium of Welsh and those people who have linguistic ability and Welsh ability but do n't necessarily do a course that allows them . So , there is a difference . We do think that , for the 2016-17 cohort , there were an additional 130 qualifiers that , actually , were fluent in Welsh and who could have gone on to teach in Welsh-medium schools , did n't necessarily do a course that gave them that designation . But , clearly , we 've got three academic years now to get to the targets that we 've set ourselves . The evaluation of Welsh-medium provision in ITE reported at the end of last month , and the Minister and officials are busy working now to implement the recommendations of the report that was published , I think , on 28 September , to be able to move this agenda forward . Again , we 've got new incentives , this year , both for people starting their course and then for teachers who complete their QTS after a year . So , we 've added in new financial incentives this year to try and address some of those issues . But , clearly , these are ambitious targets and we will need to have a step change over the next three years if we 're to meet them . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you for that , Cabinet Secretary . Thank you for that answer . We 're now talking about cohorts of students coming into PGCE and teaching degrees . If they 're from Wales , they will have had Welsh as part of their education from day one , and we 'll accept there are varying qualities in different parts of Wales , different attitudes towards it as well . But there is n't a single a person now who 's been through Welsh education who can say they have no Welsh at all , unless they 've moved into the system from , say , England very , very recently . What is being done within the teaching qualifications , including the degrees , to ensure that , at least in Welsh universities , those nascent Welsh language skills are at least kept alive , even though we 're not talking necessarily about being at a level where people can teach through the medium ? It's the age-old question : once the school gate closes , is that the end of their Welsh use ? So , is there something—it wo n't be Donaldson , but in the teacher training qualifications—that is keeping this going and , hopefully , increasing the usability of the Welsh skills they have ? Kirsty Williams AM : Well , in terms of how we can encourage children who have got Welsh skills as a result of their education up to 16 , how they can continue to use those skills and , potentially , use them in the workplace , I 'm sure Eluned will want to talk about some of the work , for instance , in other , non-teaching sectors . But , with regard to ITE , you 'll be aware that , in the evaluation report , as I said , that was published , the report comes forward with two options in how we could develop an intervention programme to support Welsh language skills amongst all primary and secondary ITE entrants . So , what we 'll be doing now as a result of that report is that we 'll be working very closely with our ITE centres to develop and agree upon minimum provision that constitutes those skill levels within ITE provision for all teachers . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Llyr . Llyr Gruffydd AM : You have your targets for 2021 , in terms of numbers of teachers coming through the system , which is positive , although , clearly , the report or the review itself said that , actually , we need to double the numbers , really . But it 's not just the trends that are going down ; it 's a cataclysmic drop , really . We 've lost 24 per cent in the number of people over the last four or five years who are going into teacher training to study subjects that they could teach through the medium of Welsh . So , it 's a huge turnaround that we 're looking for , and I 'm not getting the feeling that the level of ambition and the answers that you 're giving here this morning reflect the level of action that's needed , really . Kirsty Williams AM : Well , first of all , as I tried to illustrate to Suzy , the figures on their own tell one story , but there are additional people in the system with an ability to speak Welsh and to be able to use— Llyr Gruffydd AM : I think it's 40 per cent of those who are currently in the system who don't— Kirsty Williams AM : —the language and skills . And if we look at qualifiers of ITE courses in Wales by degree type , actually , we see a different trend—we see numbers going up . So , there are statistics and there are statistics . Depending on which ones you look at , it 's quite a complex picture . And that 's why we had the evaluation report . We understand and we know and acknowledge that there is more work to be done . That 's why we have got the evaluation of provision in ITE and that 's why we 'll be taking that ambition forward . We know what we need to do . As I said , we 're not sitting back and hoping that something miraculous will change things . We are pulling levers and putting in place plans to improve that situation . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Thank you for that . Clearly , there are statistics and there are statistics , so could you just explain to us which statistics you 've used for your targets for growth over the next three years ? Kirsty Williams AM : Well , that comes as a result of the work done for the 2050— Llyr Gruffydd AM : Upon which baseline are you basing the increases that you 're projecting ? Kirsty Williams AM : We 're using the baseline of 2012-13 . There has been a decline since then . Llyr Gruffydd AM : That 's the one I was using when I said '24 per cent reduction ' . Kirsty Williams AM : There has been a decline in those numbers . That 's why , as I said , we 're doing the work that we need to do to reverse that decline . In using those numbers , we also know that there are additional people in the system who are not captured in those figures and who do have the linguistic ability to use their language positively in school settings . So , what I 'm saying is that that does n't tell us the whole story , but I will be the first to admit that there is a significant job of work with our ITE providers to ensure that we will have the skilled professionals that we need to deliver on our ambitions , and I 'm not hiding from that . Eluned Morgan AM : Also , I just think it 's worth saying that a lot of this is about building the confidence of those people who actually can speak Welsh , who are not teaching through the medium of Welsh , and to give them that support . First of all , we need to identify who these people are , so there is a job of work being undertaken now in terms of registration in particular—when people register , let 's just make sure that we collect that kind of data . Kirsty Williams AM : We do n't even do that consistently at the moment . One of the recommendations of the report is that there is no consistent approach to understanding this baseline data and there 's no consistent competency test that people start at the beginning of their course , so we need a national approach rather than leaving it to individual institutions . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Have we missed any tricks , potentially , in terms of the reforms to accrediting ITE , for example , in terms of , maybe , strengthening aspects around the Welsh language and provision in that respect ? Kirsty Williams AM : No , I do n't believe so . The accreditation process , which is independent of the Government—the accreditation process demands of our ITE providers that their provision will be able to meet the goals of our curriculum . Our curriculum is very clear about the equality of the language and the ability of our children , through all stages of their education journey , to be able to be bilingual children . Llyr Gruffydd AM : So , that requirement , as far you 're concerned , is there . Kirsty Williams AM : Yes . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Yes , okay . Diolch—thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Before I turn to Hefin , can I just clarify— ? In answer to Suzy Davies , you said that 65 per cent of the places in Welsh training centres had been filled . Is that 65 per cent of the priority places ? Kirsty Williams AM : Priority places . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you very much . Kirsty Williams AM : Sixty-five per cent of the priority courses are being met . Lynne Neagle AM : Lovely , thank you for clarifying that . Hefin . 
Query : What did Kirsty Williams say about the trend of teacher recruiting , the reasons for it , and the steps they had taken ? Kirsty Williams AM : Thank you , Suzy . I think , for this year 's intake , although we 're in touch with our providers , we 're not in a position to be able to give figures for this year 's intake for a couple of months . But what we have seen over recent years is that we are only recruiting to about 65 per cent of those targets . So , there is still a job of work to do to understand and to respond to those needs . So , what we 're doing is first of all making sure that our ITE provision is world class , so that , actually , Welsh centres are the place to go to train to be a teacher . You 'll be aware that we 've recently been through an accreditation process for new ITE provision that will start in the next academic year . We have looked at financial incentives . It 's not the whole answer , I think , to these issues , but it 's part of a mixture of things that we need to do . You 'll be aware that , for priority subjects , with graduates with the very highest levels of qualifications , those financial incentives are now £20,000 a year . We 're also embarking on our first ever national ITE recruitment marketing exercise . We have initially done some work in the last year specifically targeting Welsh students in studying for priority subject degrees , e-mailing them , sending them materials to ask them to consider ( 1 ) becoming a teacher , and ( 2 ) crucially coming to do that training here in Wales . We are now part of a full national programme of ITE recruitment , giving people that idea that you can serve your nation and your community by training to be a teacher . So , there 's a whole package of things we need to do . In January of this year I set up an advisory board on the recruitment and retention of teaching staff , and we are awaiting some reports from that advisory group on what they feel that we should do next . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you for that answer . I can see there 's a lot of activity , but what exactly is it responding to ? Presumably , some research has been done about why people do n't want to become teachers so that the answers you come up with are appropriate answers . I ca n't believe it 's just about ITE , although this is very valuable , what you 're talking about . Is there something that 's running through our younger learners at the moment that makes them think that teaching is n't a profession they want to go into ? Is that something that 's happening just in Wales or is it happening elsewhere as well ? Kirsty Williams AM : No . I think what you will find is that this is n't a uniquely Welsh issue . I think they are suffering quite acute problems across the border , which proves to me that money is n't necessarily the entire answer , because , despite higher financial incentives to join ITE courses , they 're not able to do that in England either . So , that proves to me—what the research does show—that it 's not money alone that will get people onto these courses . Interestingly , I do n't even think it 's a UK problem . Recently , as you 'll be aware via my written statement , I attended the Atlantic Rim Collaboratory , which is a system-to-system conference . If you talk to education systems in different parts of the world , the one common factor that we are all grappling with is teacher recruitment and retention . In the USA , they have seen a 40 per cent drop in the number of students training to be teachers . So , in the Californian system , significant teacher shortages , and in Oregon , Washington . I met with New York state—significant teacher recruitment and retention problems in New York state , and in Finland , Australia . So , this is a common issue across the globe , really . That 's why we set up the advisory group under the chairmanship of Professor John Gardner—it 's to understand what the issues are exactly that are preventing people or putting people off . One of the things that we have got strong performance in , and I think this is perhaps something that we 're trying to follow up on , are employment-based routes into qualified teacher status—so , those are people who are training on the job . Those remain strong . There 's high demand for those places , so much so that we 've increased those places to 90 last year and 90 again this year , which says to me that—there 's definitely a place for the traditional , 'Take a year off , do a postgraduate certificate in education in a university for a year'—actually , that type of course suits some students but it might be preventing other people from pursuing a qualification in teaching , which is why , of course , from next year , we will have our unique part-time PGCE route into qualification . So , that allows people to perhaps combine some of their employment opportunities , so they can earn while they learn , or maybe they 've got caring responsibilities that prevent them from going to do a full-time course . I think that will give us an alternative route that people can take to gain qualified teacher status and work in our schools . So , there 's no one thing , I think , that we can do that will solve this issue . But it is an international issue , I agree with that . 
Query : How did Kirsty Williams respond to the doubt that their action was not enough ? Llyr Gruffydd AM : You have your targets for 2021 , in terms of numbers of teachers coming through the system , which is positive , although , clearly , the report or the review itself said that , actually , we need to double the numbers , really . But it 's not just the trends that are going down ; it 's a cataclysmic drop , really . We 've lost 24 per cent in the number of people over the last four or five years who are going into teacher training to study subjects that they could teach through the medium of Welsh . So , it 's a huge turnaround that we 're looking for , and I 'm not getting the feeling that the level of ambition and the answers that you 're giving here this morning reflect the level of action that's needed , really . Kirsty Williams AM : Well , first of all , as I tried to illustrate to Suzy , the figures on their own tell one story , but there are additional people in the system with an ability to speak Welsh and to be able to use— Llyr Gruffydd AM : I think it's 40 per cent of those who are currently in the system who don't— Kirsty Williams AM : —the language and skills . And if we look at qualifiers of ITE courses in Wales by degree type , actually , we see a different trend—we see numbers going up . So , there are statistics and there are statistics . Depending on which ones you look at , it 's quite a complex picture . And that 's why we had the evaluation report . We understand and we know and acknowledge that there is more work to be done . That 's why we have got the evaluation of provision in ITE and that 's why we 'll be taking that ambition forward . We know what we need to do . As I said , we 're not sitting back and hoping that something miraculous will change things . We are pulling levers and putting in place plans to improve that situation . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Thank you for that . Clearly , there are statistics and there are statistics , so could you just explain to us which statistics you 've used for your targets for growth over the next three years ? Kirsty Williams AM : Well , that comes as a result of the work done for the 2050— Llyr Gruffydd AM : Upon which baseline are you basing the increases that you 're projecting ? Kirsty Williams AM : We 're using the baseline of 2012-13 . There has been a decline since then . Llyr Gruffydd AM : That 's the one I was using when I said '24 per cent reduction ' . Kirsty Williams AM : There has been a decline in those numbers . That 's why , as I said , we 're doing the work that we need to do to reverse that decline . In using those numbers , we also know that there are additional people in the system who are not captured in those figures and who do have the linguistic ability to use their language positively in school settings . So , what I 'm saying is that that does n't tell us the whole story , but I will be the first to admit that there is a significant job of work with our ITE providers to ensure that we will have the skilled professionals that we need to deliver on our ambitions , and I 'm not hiding from that . 
Query : Summarize their discussion on the decision of not accrediting the University of South Wales with the ability to deliver teacher training . Hefin David AM : The decision by the Education Workforce Council not to accredit the University of South Wales with the ability to deliver teacher training—what are your views and concerns about that ? Kirsty Williams AM : The process is independent of Government , and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on that , especially as I understand that there is an appeals process that may be being undertaken . What I would say is that from the very outset of our ITE reforms we have made it very clear that I expect very high standards in our ITE system , but the process is independent of this Government . I have confidence in the people who have been appointed by the EWC to undertake that process , but it is independent of me , and it 's not appropriate for me to comment on that further . Hefin David AM : I fully understand that and the need for distance for the EWC , but there 'll be an impact on students and staff . Students , first of all : are you concerned that the reduction in providers might have an impact on students , and those students going through the second year at USW ? Would you have concerns about that issue ? Kirsty Williams AM : In terms of the overall numbers , we will be looking to commission from those institutions that have been accredited the number of training places that our planning tool says that we need . So , in terms of an overall number of places , we will commission from those accredited units . Clearly , there will be a responsibility upon the University of South Wales to ensure that those students already in the system are able to complete their studies and their course , with the appropriate level of support and tuition to enable them to achieve their career aspirations and to graduate from that programme . Hefin David AM : And what about the uncertainty for staff , or would you say that 's an issue for the university itself ? Kirsty Williams AM : These are autonomous bodies . They have to act accordingly , in compliance with any employment law or any statutory responsibilities that they would have as an employer . That 's not a matter for me ; that is a matter for the institution that is an autonomous body . Hefin David AM : But I would be surprised if you were n't keeping an eye on this , given that it has been a key provider . Are you aware of when the appeal decision will be known ? Kirsty Williams AM : My understanding is that the appeals process is ongoing , and next month , perhaps . But as I said , this is a process that is independent of Government— Hefin David AM : But it will have an impact for what you do . Kirsty Williams AM : It will potentially change the nature of the people from whom we commission places , but as I said , I do not have any concerns that we will not be in a position to commission the appropriate number of training places that we will need as a result of our planning . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . Suzy on this—mindful of what the Minister said about it being an independent decision . Suzy Davies AM : It 's not directly about USW ; it 's about the geographic spread of provision . I wonder if you could just give us a snapshot of what that looks like , and whether you think—certainly for PGCE or postgrad courses , anyway—that if they 're not accessible geographically and we 've got students who already have three years ' worth of debt , they 're not going to be looking to , necessarily , live away from home for a fourth year , and may want to study nearer home . Has there been any research done on the access to these postgrad courses , about where people are coming from and whether that 's had an impact on the fact that some of these places have n't been filled ? Kirsty Williams AM : Currently , with our current providers , there is a significant geographical spread . There are centres here in the south-east , there are centres in the south-west , in mid Wales , and in north Wales . Obviously , accessibility is an issue for us . We do think that , for some students , accessibility is an issue , and of course that 's why we are responding with our part-time PGCE route , which actually will be location neutral , because you will be able to study that as a distance learner , and so you will be able to remain in your community and undertake that course . So , that 's part of the attractiveness , I believe , of offering that to people . So , if geographical disadvantage is stopping somebody from pursuing a career aspiration to qualify as a teacher , our new part-time PGCE , as I said , will allow them to do that .

Query : Summarize their discussions on university mergers . Hefin David AM : Cabinet Secretary , are you in favour of more university mergers ? Kirsty Williams AM : I would n't use the word 'agnostic ' , but what I 'm in favour of is a healthy , strong and sustainable HE sector . If individual institutions wish to collaborate or , indeed , go further to a formal merger then , obviously , that is a matter for them . We 're not pursuing or urging a policy of mergers , but , if individual institutions feel that is of benefit to them and their students , obviously , we would have an interest in that and making sure that they were robust plans , but that 's a matter for individual institutions . Hefin David AM : But HEFCW are pushing it . Kirsty Williams AM : Well , again , what HEFCW are interested in is a sustainable HE sector that is strong but , as I said , I do not have a burning desire or a set policy to try and pursue mergers . Hefin David AM : Okay . That 's a little bit of a contrast with your predecessors , then . Kirsty Williams AM : Well , that 's a matter for them . Hefin David AM : Okay . The reason I say it is because I was kind of on the inside when Cardiff Metropolitan University was under pressure from the then Minister to merge with the University of Glamorgan and Newport . It was a very difficult time for staff and , indeed , for students . You had the University and College Union and the Minister pushing it ; the vice-chancellor of Cardiff Met at the time very much against it . So , do you think that it 's really— ? You 're agnostic , but do you think perhaps it 's not worth the disruption that can occur to staff and students ? Kirsty Williams AM : As I said , Hefin , I have no formal policy for reconfiguration or mergers . That 's not to say I do n't believe in collaboration between institutions . Going back to the issue of ITE , a very interesting programme came forward from Cardiff Met and Cardiff University for their ITE provision . So , I 'm all for universities and institutions working together , but there 's no formal policy . These are autonomous institutions . If they see that there is an advantage—I would hope for the student first , and , if we put the student at the front of this process , then we would obviously have an interest in that and making sure that that was the right thing to do . But , certainly , there is no pressure from us as a Government to pursue an agenda of mergers . Hefin David AM : Just to be clear , then , that 's likely to be a policy for the foreseeable future as well ; you 're not going to change that view . Kirsty Williams AM : I have no intentions at this stage , but 'Events , dear boy ' . [ Laughter . ] You know , sometimes there may be a situation that I can not foresee at this moment that would necessitate , for the benefit of students , the benefit of Wales , a merger . So , never say never , but , at this point in time , I do not foresee us changing that policy . Lynne Neagle AM : Julie on this . Julie Morgan AM : Yes , just looking back at that time , which I remember very vividly— Hefin David AM : So do I . Julie Morgan AM : I had many meetings with Cardiff Met . Do you feel there has been any disadvantage to Cardiff Met because that merger did n't go ahead ? Kirsty Williams AM : I , personally , am not aware of any disadvantage to Cardiff Met , but I would recognise—I would absolutely recognise—for staff and students caught up in those deliberations and those issues , then that would have had a personal impact on them . In terms of the institution going forward , I 'm not aware that they are currently struggling with any disadvantage from that discussion . And , as I said , I 'm really heartened by some of the really interesting collaborative work that Cardiff Met are interested in doing , and new partnerships and new collaborations between institutions , whether that be Cardiff Uni or local colleges , and I think that 's to be welcomed . Julie Morgan AM : So , following on from what Hefin said , was it worth all the fuss ? Kirsty Williams AM : Well , look , as it 's turned out , we have a strong institution in Cardiff Met , and I think , rather than looking at the past , we need to look at the future . But , of course , there was some reconfiguration and we need to understand any lessons that arose out of reconfiguration , and HEFCW are currently doing some work , actually , to look at reconfiguration , the experience of reconfiguration that did happen , and were benefits realised and what are the lessons that can be learned from that process . So , they are doing a piece of work to reflect , and that will , perhaps , help inform us as we go forward . 
Query : How did Kirsty Williams respond to university mergers ? Hefin David AM : So do I .

Query : Summarize their discussions on pay dispute situations . Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you , Chair . I wanted to ask you about the pay dispute , and I know that you 're not the employer , because I know that 's going to be the first answer— Kirsty Williams AM : You 're right , that is the first answer . [ Laughter . ] Well anticipated . Dawn Bowden AM : But we are in a stalemate here and you clearly have an interest in making sure that this dispute is resolved quickly in the interest of the students and the reputation of the colleges et cetera , et cetera . I can see how this dispute has arisen . When we 've seen the teachers ' pay settlement , we 've seen FE settlements in England and Scotland higher than what's on the table here . And I am concerned , and I do think this is where the Welsh Government does have a role , because I am concerned that the employers seem to be using the funding issue as the reason not to have a reasonable settlement with staff . So , they 've walked away from the table , they 've said , 'One per cent , take it or leave it . Unless Welsh Government gives us any more money , that 's the end of that . ' And I 'm really concerned about that , because this is potentially going to have a major impact on whether we can recruit and retain staff in FE colleges . And I look at the college in my constituency , Merthyr college—it 's a tertiary college , they 're providing A-level education across Merthyr and they 're astounding results they 've been getting as well . I 'm coming round to the question in a moment . It 's really : what more do you think you can do as a Government to try to get these parties back round the table and not allow the dispute to become a political football ? Eluned Morgan AM : Thanks very much for that . I think , first of all , you 're absolutely right—this is about ColegauCymru 's negotiation , but we are keeping a close eye on the situation . I think it 's probably worth emphasising that the reason this has come about , or part of the reason , is because you 've seen that pay settlement in relation to teachers ' pay and we 've had the consequential . So , sixth-form teachers are happy . The people actually providing the same teaching course in a different institution , you can understand why they may say , 'Something needs to change here . ' The problem here is that it 's about that , actually , that falls to the Welsh Government . We do n't have that . Or at least it falls to FE colleges to fund that , and it 's up to them to come up with that proposal . We are keeping a close eye on things . I think it 's fair to say that we 'll wait until they get further along down the line , but we are extremely aware of the sensitivities of the situation . Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you for that , Minister . When you say you 're keeping a close eye on it , have you actually had conversations with ColegauCymru ? Because I note what you just said there : 'We 'll keep an eye on it and wait and see what 's happening . ' Well , all the unions are currently consulting . One has already balloted for industrial action . We could have the other unions also balloting for industrial action . I mean , this is n't something we want in the FE sector , clearly , so is there anything more proactive that Government could actually be doing to try to bring a resolution to this dispute ? Eluned Morgan AM : Well , we are listening and speaking to ColegauCymru , and also we 're aware of what the unions are saying as well . So , I think that 's probably as far as we can go at this point . When they come to a conclusion , and when they come to us and say , 'Look , this is the consequence and this will finish'—at this point , we have no idea where that settlement is likely to fall . Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you , Chair . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . Llyr . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Yes , thank you . Yes , we would n't expect you to make an announcement on this , because it 's happening outside of Government , but there is a principle here , is n't there , in terms of pay equality between schoolteachers and FE ? So , would you not wish to see a situation where we do have greater equality in that respect ? Eluned Morgan AM : In relation to teaching , I think it 's fair to say that we would wish to see pay equality in relation to teaching , yes . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Okay , thank you . You emphasise 'in relation to teaching'—my next question is that , of course , within FE establishments you have teaching staff and non-teaching staff , and if there was to be some sort of increase , then would you not expect all staff to have that ? Eluned Morgan AM : Well , let 's see—that 's up to ColegauCymru to negotiate and to discuss , so let 's see what the outcomes are . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Because some of the non-teaching staff are the lowest paid , as well , are n't they ? So , you know— . Eluned Morgan AM : Let 's wait for the outcome of the negotiations . I think we are very aware of the situation . ColegauCymru are in that negotiation . We 're aware of what the requests are from the trade union members , and we 'll wait to see what they come up with before responding formally . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Could I just briefly as well ask about pensions , because that 's coming down the line , potentially , is n't it , and the impact that 's going to have on FE ? One college was saying it will cost them £1 million if it happens next year . Are you thinking about any steps that you could take to support them , potentially , because obviously this is coming down the line , really , is n't it ? Eluned Morgan AM : Well , I think , already , we 've got the situation in relation to teachers , and again what we 've seen is the consequential and the UK Government honouring that . Again , what we do n't have , necessarily , is that money coming down from the UK Government for us to be able to support it in the way that we might like to . It 's early days on this , but it 's something , again , we 're keeping an eye on . Llyr Gruffydd AM : The fundamental question , really , is : if the money does n't come down the line from Westminster , are you in a position to underwrite that ? Eluned Morgan AM : Well , we 'll wait until we see that situation arising , but we 're aware that that is an issue that we 're going to have to deal with in future . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Diolch . Lynne Neagle AM : In relation to the pay dispute , it 's the committee 's understanding that ColegauCymru 's position is that , in order to meet a pay award that is commensurate with schoolteachers , an additional 3.5 per cent or £10.1 million is needed . Are you aware of that being their position ?

Query : How did Eluned Morgan respond to whether wishing to see people have greater pay equality between schoolteachers and FE when discussing the pay dispute situation ? Llyr Gruffydd AM : Yes , thank you .

Eluned Morgan AM : In relation to teaching , I think it 's fair to say that we would wish to see pay equality in relation to teaching , yes . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Okay , thank you . You emphasise 'in relation to teaching'—my next question is that , of course , within FE establishments you have teaching staff and non-teaching staff , and if there was to be some sort of increase , then would you not expect all staff to have that ? Eluned Morgan AM : Well , let 's see—that 's up to ColegauCymru to negotiate and to discuss , so let 's see what the outcomes are . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Because some of the non-teaching staff are the lowest paid , as well , are n't they ? So , you know— . Eluned Morgan AM : Let 's wait for the outcome of the negotiations . I think we are very aware of the situation . ColegauCymru are in that negotiation . We 're aware of what the requests are from the trade union members , and we 'll wait to see what they come up with before responding formally . 
Query : Summarize the meeting Grad A : OK , we 're on . Professor B : Yeah . Grad A : So , I think this is gon na be a pretty short meeting because I have four agenda items , three of them were requested by Jane who is not gon na be at the meeting today . So . { vocalsound } The uh first was transcription status . Does anyone besides Jane know what the transcription status is ? PhD F : Um , sort of , I do , peripherally . PhD C : Is that English ? PhD F : Um { disfmarker } Well first of all with IBM I got a note from Brian yesterday saying that they finally made the tape for the thing that we sent them a { pause } week or week and a half ago PhD D : That 's our system . Grad A : Ugh ! PhD F : and that it 's gone out to the transcribers and hopefully next week we 'll have the transcription back from that . Grad A : C can I have a pen ? PhD F : Um { disfmarker } Jane seems to be um moving right along on the transcriptions from the ICSI side . She 's assigned , I think probably five or six m more meetings . PhD C : Yeah , I think we 're up to MR thirteen or something . PhD D : Mmm . PhD F : Yeah , so um , I guess she 's hired some new transcribers PhD D : Speaking { disfmarker } Grad E : Which meetings is she transcribing ? PhD F : and { disfmarker } Um well we 've { disfmarker } we 've run out of E D Us because a certain number of them are um , sort of awaiting to go to IBM . Grad E : OK . PhD C : For IBM , yeah . PhD D : Hmm . Grad E : OK . PhD F : and the rest are in process being transcribed uh here . PhD D : So does she have transcribers right now who are basically sitting idle because there 's no data back from IBM Grad E : So we 're doing some in parallel . Grad A : Yep . PhD F : No . Grad A : No , no . PhD F : Oh no no . Grad A : We have n't done that process . PhD D : no ? PhD F : No . We 're not waiting on them . Grad A : So . They ' r they 're doing the full transcription process . PhD D : Oh . Oh , OK . Grad E : So they 're just doing their own thing until { disfmarker } PhD F : Yeah . PhD D : Because I { disfmarker } I need to ask Jane whether it 's { disfmarker } it would be OK for her { disfmarker } um , s some of her people to transcribe uh some of the initial data we got from the SmartKom data collection , which is these short like five or seven minute sessions . PhD F : We 're doing it in parallel , yeah . Grad E : OK . PhD C : Yep . PhD D : Um and we want it { disfmarker } You know , we need { disfmarker } The { disfmarker } Again , we { disfmarker } we have a similar uh logistic set - up where we are supposed to send the data to Munich Grad A : Right . PhD D : and get it transcribed and get it back . But to get going we would like some of the data transcribed right away so we can get started . Grad A : Yep , sounds familiar . PhD D : And so um I wanted to ask Jane if { disfmarker } if uh , you know , maybe one of their transcribers could { disfmarker } could do { disfmarker } I mean since these are very short , that should really be uh , Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD D : um { disfmarker } It 's { disfmarker } PhD C : There 's only two channels . So it 's only { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD D : Yeah . PhD C : As the synthesis does n't have to be transcribed I think . PhD D : It 's only two { disfmarker } Right , s PhD C : So . PhD D : Yeah . So { disfmarker } So it 's basically one channel to transcribe . And it 's { disfmarker } One session is only uh like seven { disfmarker } Professor B : So that should have ma many fewer { disfmarker } And it 's also not uh a bunch of interruptions with people and all that , PhD D : Right . And some of it is read speech , so we could give them the { disfmarker } the thing that they 're reading Professor B : right ? So . Yeah . PhD D : and they just may { disfmarker } Grad A : Make sure it 's right . PhD C : Yep . PhD D : And so um , um , I guess since she 's { disfmarker } I was gon na ask her but since she 's not around I { disfmarker } maybe I 'll { disfmarker } Professor B : Yeah , well it certainly seems { disfmarker } PhD D : Uh if { disfmarker } if that 's OK with you to { disfmarker } to , you know , get that stuff uh { disfmarker } to ask her for that , then I 'll do that . Professor B : Yeah . Yeah , if we 're held up on this other stuff a little bit in order to encompass that , that 's OK because I I um , I mean I still have high hopes that the that the IBM pipeline 'll work out for us , so it 's { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah . OK , yeah . Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : Alrighty . PhD F : Oh , yeah , and also related to the transcription stuff , so I 've been trying to keep a web page uh up to date f showing what the current status is of the trans of all the things we 've collected and what stage each meeting is in , in terms of whether it 's { disfmarker } Grad A : Can you mail that out to the list ? PhD F : Mm - hmm , yeah I will . I { disfmarker } That 's the thing that I sent out just to foo people saying can you update these pages Grad A : Oh , OK , OK . PhD F : and so that 's where I 'm putting it but I 'll { disfmarker } I 'll send it out to the list telling people to look at it . Grad A : Yeah , I have n't done that . So . I have lots of stuff to add that 's just in my own directory . PhD F : Yeah . Grad A : I 'll try to get to that . OK . So Jane also wanted to talk about participant approval , but I do n't really think there 's much to talk about . I 'm just gon na do it . And uh , if anyone objects too much then they can do it instead . Professor B : You are going to { disfmarker } Grad A : I 'm gon na send out to the participants , uh , with links to web pages which contain the transcripts and allow them to { pause } suggest edits . And then bleep them out . Professor B : OK . Grad A : For the ones that we have . Um { disfmarker } PhD C : So but it 's just transcripts , not the { disfmarker } not the audio ? Grad A : Nope , they 'll have access to the audio also . PhD C : OK , yeah , yep . Ah . Grad A : I mean that 's my intention . Because the transcripts might not be right . PhD C : Yeah . PhD F : So { disfmarker } Grad A : So you want people to be able to listen to them . PhD C : Yeah . PhD F : So , um the audio that they 're gon na have access to , will that be the uncompressed version ? Or will you have scripts that like uncompress the various pieces and { disfmarker } Grad A : Oh , that 's a good point . That 's a good point . Yeah , it 's { disfmarker } it 's probably going to have to be the uncompressed versions because , uh , uh , it takes too long to do random access decompression . PhD F : Hmm . Yeah , I was just wondering because we 're uh running out of the un - backed - up disk space on Grad A : Well , that was the other point . PhD F : Oh , was that another one ? Grad A : Yep , that 's another agenda item . PhD F : OK . I 'll wait . Grad A : So , uh { disfmarker } But that is a good point so we 'll get to that , too . Um , DARPA demo status , not much to say . The back - end stuff is working out fine . It 's more or less ready to go . I 've added some stuff that uh indes indexes by the meeting type MR , EDU , et cetera and also by the user ID . So that the front - end can then do filtering based on that as well . Uh { disfmarker } The back - end is uh , going more slowly as I s I think I said before just cuz I 'm not much of a Tcl - TK programmer . And uh Dave Gelbart says he 's a little too busy . So I think Don and I are gon na work on that and { disfmarker } and you and I can just talk about it off - line more . Grad E : Right . Grad A : But uh { pause } the back - end was pretty smooth . Professor B : Oh Grad A : So I think , we 'll have something . It may not be as { disfmarker } As pretty as we might like , but we 'll have something . Professor B : I wondered whe when we would reach Dave 's saturation point . He 's sort of been { disfmarker } been volunteering for everything Grad A : Yeah . Professor B : and { pause } and uh { disfmarker } PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : O K . Finally said he was too busy . I guess we reached it . Grad A : Yeah , he { disfmarker } he actually { disfmarker } he volunteered but then he s then he retracted it . So . Oh well . Um { disfmarker } Grad E : And , also um , I was just showing Andreas , I got um an X Waves kind of display , and I do n't know how much more we can do with it { disfmarker } with like the prosodic stuff where we have like stylized pitches and signals and the transcripts on the bottom Grad A : Oh , cool . Grad E : so , right now it 's just an X Waves and then you have three windows but I do n't know , it looked pretty nice and I 'm sure it { disfmarker } think it has potential for a little something , Grad A : For a demo ? Grad E : yeah , for a demo . Grad A : Yeah , sounds good . Grad E : So { disfmarker } Professor B : OK , so again , the issue is { disfmarker } For July , the issue 's gon na be what can we fit into a Windows machine , uh , and so on , but { disfmarker } Grad E : Oh . OK . Grad A : So it might just be slides . Grad E : Yeah , OK . PhD C : Well { disfmarker } { pause } Yeah . Grad E : Well , we 'll see , um { disfmarker } PhD C : I 've been putting together uh Transcriber things for Windows so i And I installed it on Dave Gelbart 's PC and it worked just fine . So hopefully that will work . PhD D : Really ? So is that { disfmarker } Because there 's some people um { disfmarker } It would be cool if we could uh get that to work uh at { disfmarker } at SRI PhD C : Yeah . Yep . PhD D : because the um { disfmarker } Grad A : Well Transcriber is Tcl - TK , very generic with Snack , PhD D : we have m m We have more Windows machines to run the { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . Grad A : so basically anything you can get Snack to run on , it will work . PhD D : Right . PhD C : Yeah . Yeah but { disfmarker } But the problem is the version Transcriber works with , the Snack version , is one point six whatever and that 's not anymore supported . It 's not on { disfmarker } on the web page anymore . But I just wrote an email to { disfmarker } to the author of { disfmarker } to the Snack author and he sent me to one point six whatever library Grad A : Well I thought it was packaged with Transcriber ? PhD C : and so it works . Yeah , but then you ca n't add our patches and then the { disfmarker } the new version is { disfmarker } is totally different Grad A : Oh . PhD C : a and in { disfmarker } yeah , in terms of { disfmarker } of the source code . Grad A : Ah . PhD C : You { disfmarker } you ca n't find the Tcl files anymore . It 's some whatever wrapped thing PhD D : Mmm . PhD C : and you ca n't { disfmarker } you ca n't access that so you have to install { disfmarker } First install Tcl then install Snack and then install the Transcriber thing and then do the patches . Grad A : Patch . Ugh ! PhD D : I { disfmarker } I wonder if { disfmarker } if we should contribute our changes back to the authors so that they maintain those changes along { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . Yeah . Grad A : We have { disfmarker } Yeah b it 's just has n't made it into the release yet . PhD D : We have ? Oh . Oh , OK . PhD F : So did you um put the uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } the NT version out on the uh Meeting Recorder page ? Or { disfmarker } PhD C : No , I have n't done that yet . I 'm { disfmarker } oh Nope . But I definitely will do that . Professor B : So , can some of the stuff that Don 's talking about somehow fit into this Uh , mean you just have a set of numbers that are associated with the { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah . PhD C : So { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah , it 's basically ASCII files or binary files , whatever representation . Just three different { disfmarker } It 's a waveform and just a stylized pitch vector basically so it 's { disfmarker } PhD D : So { disfmarker } So { disfmarker } Well { disfmarker } Grad E : I mean we could do it in Matl - { comment } I mean you could do it in a number of different places I 'm sure . PhD D : But { disfmarker } But it would be cool if the Transcriber interface had like another window for the { disfmarker } you know , maybe above the waveform where it would show some arbitrary valued function that is { disfmarker } that is you know time synchron ti ti time synchronous with the wavform . PhD C : Yep . Grad E : Yeah . Professor B : Yes . Grad E : Yeah , that 'd be very cool . Grad A : It 'd be easy enough to add that . Again it 's { disfmarker } it 's { pause } It 's more Tcl - T Grad E : Yeah . Grad A : So someone who 's familiar with Tcl - TK has to do it , PhD D : Right . Grad A : but uh , it would n't be hard to do . PhD D : Right . But it would almost be like having another waveform displayed . Grad A : Yep . PhD C : Yep . PhD D : S Grad E : Mm - hmm . PhD D : Right . PhD C : Yeah . Yeah , maybe we could l look into that . Grad E : Yeah . Grad A : But it { disfmarker } it seems to me that I c PhD C : And { disfmarker } Grad A : It does n't seem like having that real time is that necessary . So yo It seems to me you could do images . Grad E : Um { pause } What do you mean by real time ? Do you mean like { disfmarker } PhD F : Like being able to scroll through it and stuff for the demo . Grad E : OK . Grad A : Yeah , jus Yeah . PhD F : Is that what you mean ? Grad A : It just seems to me jus Grad E : It would be cool to see it { disfmarker } PhD F : Yeah . Grad E : It would be cool like to see { disfmarker } to hear it and see it , PhD C : And to hear it . Yeah . Yeah . Grad E : and see the pitch contours also . Grad A : Sure , but I do n't think { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } You can do all that just statically in PhD C : Yeah . Grad E : I think it would lose { disfmarker } Yeah , I mean y Grad A : Just record the audio clip and show an image and I think that 's { disfmarker } Grad E : Right , right . I just thought if you meant slides I thought you meant like just { pause } like { pause } um view graphs or something . Professor B : You know , wh Yeah . So . Uh , no , we 're talking about on the computer and { disfmarker } and um , I think when we were talking about this before we had littl this little demo meeting , Grad E : Right . Professor B : we sort of set up a range of different degrees of liveness that you could have and , { vocalsound } the more live , the better , but uh , given the crunch of time , we may have to retreat from it to some extent . So I think { disfmarker } { pause } For a lot of reasons , I think it would be very nice to have this Transcriber interface be able to show some other interesting signal along with it PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : so it 'd be a good thing to get in there . But , um { disfmarker } Anyway , jus just looking for ways that we could actually show what you 're doing , uh , in { disfmarker } { pause } to people . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor B : Cuz a lot of this stuff , particularly for Communicator , uh certainly a significant chunk of the things that we waved our arms about th originally had t had to do with prosodics It 'd be nice to show that we can actually get them and see them . PhD D : Mmm . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad A : And the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again . So , we 're doing OK on backed up . We 're { disfmarker } We 're only about thirty percent on the second disk . So , uh , we have a little bit of time before that becomes critical , but we are like ninety five percent , ninety eight percent on the scratch disks for the expanded meetings . PhD C : Yeah . Grad A : And , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space , but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data { pause } all at once , in a lot of different ways . PhD C : Yeah . PhD F : Oh there 's a lot of transcribers , too . Grad A : Yeah , there 're a lot of transcribers , PhD C : Yeah . Grad A : so all of those need to be expanded , and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh , uh , uh , the permission forms , PhD F : Mm - hmm . PhD C : An PhD F : Right . Grad A : so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around . Um { disfmarker } And Jane was gon na talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it . One of the things I was thinking is we { disfmarker } we just got these hundred { disfmarker } alright , excuse me { disfmarker } ten , uh SPARC - Blade SUN - Blades . Professor B : Did they come in ? PhD F : SUN - Blades . PhD D : Yeah . PhD F : Yeah . They came in the other day . Grad A : They came in but they 're not set up yet . Professor B : Oh . Grad A : And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those { pause } because they 'll be in the machine room , they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines . And if we just need un - backed - up space , we could just hang disks off them . PhD F : Well , is there { disfmarker } Why not just hang them off of Abbott , is there a { disfmarker } Grad A : Because there 's no more room in the disk racks on Abbott . Professor B : Yeah . PhD F : Ah . Professor B : Were n't we gon na get { disfmarker } PhD F : Ah , I see . Professor B : Well , maybe it should get another rack . PhD D : But you still need to store the disks somehow . Grad A : Well , but the SUN - Blades have spare drive bays . PhD D : So { disfmarker } Grad A : Just put them in . PhD F : You can put two { disfmarker } PhD D : Oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the { disfmarker } Grad A : Sure . PhD C : Internal . Yeah . Grad A : Yeah . Cuz the SUN { disfmarker } uh , these SUN - Blades take commodity hard drives . PhD D : Oh . Grad A : So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in . PhD D : Mmm . Professor B : But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } file server { comment } it seems like we would want to get it , uh , a second disk rack or something . PhD D : Plus we 're talking about buying a second dis uh , file server . Grad A : Well , I mean there are lots of long term solutions . What I 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting ? PhD C : Yep . PhD D : I see { vocalsound } { pause } Oh , I see . Professor B : Well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten , might n't you ? Uh , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days , Grad A : Oh , I did n't know he had left already . Professor B : Uh , well , tonight . Grad A : Oh , oh well . PhD D : You mean he wo n't set up the { disfmarker } mmm . Professor B : I do n't know . Grad E : How much space do you need for these ? Professor B : I do n't know what his schedule is . Grad A : You { disfmarker } we need about a gig per meeting . Professor B : I 'm just saying he 's gone . PhD C : Yep . PhD F : I { disfmarker } I thi Grad E : I have um { disfmarker } I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . Grad A : Alright ! What 's your computer 's name ? Grad E : So { disfmarker } Uh , Samosa . Professor B : You had an eighteen gigabyte drive . Grad E : Yeah , I had . Well it 's about { disfmarker } I think there 's about twelve gig left . Grad A : So it { disfmarker } And you have an X drives installed ? OK . Grad E : Yeah . So , I did n't realize it was so critical . Grad A : And you 're o you 're offering ? Grad E : I mean I 'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri or that are { disfmarker } new transcriptions coming in I really ca n't do anything . Grad A : OK . Grad E : Um not that I ca n't do anything , I jus PhD F : I { disfmarker } I jus I just gave Thilo some { disfmarker } about ten gigs , the last ten gigs of space that there was on { disfmarker } on uh Abbott . Uh { disfmarker } And uh { disfmarker } So but that { disfmarker } But { disfmarker } Grad A : Which one was that , X { pause } G ? X { pause } G ? PhD C : XG . PhD F : XG . Grad A : OK . PhD D : XG ? PhD F : Yeah . PhD D : That 's also where we store the { disfmarker } The uh Hub - five training set waveforms , PhD C : Oops . Grad A : But that wo n't be getting any bigger , PhD D : right ? PhD F : No . Grad A : will it ? PhD F : I do n't think that 's on XG . PhD D : Right . PhD F : On XG is only Carmen and Du - and Stephane 's disk . PhD C : It 's { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD D : But I 've also been storing { disfmarker } I 've been storing the feature files there and I guess I can s start deleting some because we now know what the best features are Grad E : Well { disfmarker } PhD D : and we wo n't be using the old ones anymore . Grad E : I have a lot of space , though . PhD F : Yeah , I do I do n't think it was on XG . PhD D : Uh { disfmarker } Oh thats XA { disfmarker } Oh that 's X { disfmarker } PhD C : Is n't that XH ? PhD F : I th Grad A : Not { disfmarker } not for long . Grad E : I have a lot of space and it 's not { disfmarker } it 's n There 's very little uh { disfmarker } Yeah not for long . PhD D : Maybe I 'm confu Grad E : But I mean it 's not going f PhD D : Oh no I 'm sorry . Grad E : It 's not being used often at all . PhD C : But I 'm using XH { disfmarker } H , too . Grad A : Yeah , it 's probably { disfmarker } Probably only about four gig is on X { disfmarker } on your X drive , PhD C : So . PhD D : Oh OK . Grad A : but we 'll definitely take it up if you { disfmarker } Grad E : I th PhD D : I think you 're right . It 's XH and D { disfmarker } Grad E : I think it 's about four or five gig cuz I have four meetings on there , PhD D : The b I 'm also using DG I got that confused . Grad E : three or four meetings . PhD D : OK . Grad A : Great . Grad E : So . Grad A : OK , so that will get us through the next couple days . Professor B : We need { disfmarker } We need another gigaquad . Grad A : Yep . At least . Professor B : There should { disfmarker } I d There should just be a b I should have a button . Grad A : The `` more disk space `` button ? Professor B : Just press { disfmarker } Press each meeting saying `` we need more disk space `` { vocalsound } `` this week `` . Grad A : Yep . Professor B : Skip the rest of the conversation . PhD F : Well we 've collected so far something like uh sixty - five meetings . Professor B : And { disfmarker } And how much does each meeting take ? PhD F : And it 's about a gig uncompressed . PhD C : It 's { disfmarker } It 's a little bit more as I usually do n't { disfmarker } do not uncompress the { disfmarker } all of the PZM and the PDA things . PhD F : Is a little more ? PhD C : So . PhD F : Right , yeah so if you uncompressed everything it 's even more . PhD C : It 's { disfmarker } Yeah . One point five or something . PhD F : U Uh compressed how much are they ? Like { disfmarker } Grad A : Half a gig . For all of them . PhD F : About half ? PhD C : Yeah . Yeah . Yep . PhD F : So we 're definitely are storing you know , all of those . So there 's what thirty some gig of just meetings so far ? Professor B : So - so So maybe there 's a hundred { pause } gig or something . Or { disfmarker } I mean . Cuz we { disfmarker } we have the uncompressed around also . PhD F : Mm - hmm . Right . Professor B : So it 's like { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . PhD F : Right . Well we { disfmarker } We have n't uncompressed all the meetings , but { disfmarker } Grad A : I would like to . Professor B : Yeah . Well I mean it 's { disfmarker } the they really are cheap . I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , Grad A : Yep . PhD F : Right . Professor B : but But uh , we could { disfmarker } You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks . I mean it 's { disfmarker } it 's small { disfmarker } I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars . PhD F : Yeah . Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for { disfmarker } if we could get some disk . Professor B : Yeah . PhD F : I s I sent this out a { disfmarker } a day ago Grad A : And put it where ? Professor B : Right . PhD F : but { disfmarker } and Dave did n't respond so I don I do n't know how the whole process works . I mean does he just go out and get them and { disfmarker } if it 's OK , and { disfmarker } Grad A : Yep . PhD F : So I was assuming he was gon na take over { pause } that . But he 's probably too busy given that he 's leaving . Professor B : Yeah , I think you need a direct conversation with him . And just { vocalsound } say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do . And in my answer back was `` are you sure you just want one ? `` So I mean I think { pause } that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure `` well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months `` . PhD F : Yeah . Grad A : Wa - a I know what they want . The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine . So they do n't want to stack up external drives . Professor B : Yeah . Grad A : Um { disfmarker } { pause } And then they want everything else in the machine room . Professor B : Right . Grad A : So the question is where are you gon na hang them ? PhD F : Mm - hmm . I do n't know what the space situation is in the machine room . Grad A : Right . PhD F : So . Professor B : Right . So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave , PhD D : Th - The { disfmarker } PhD F : I think part of the reason why Dave ca n't get the { disfmarker } the new machines up is because he does n't have room in the machine room right now . Professor B : cuz it { disfmarker } PhD D : One { disfmarker } Mmm . Grad A : Yep . PhD D : One { disfmarker } One On - One thing to in to um t to do when you need to conserve space is PhD F : So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff . PhD D : I bet there are still some old , uh , like , nine gig disks , uh , around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and { disfmarker } and you know recover the space . Grad A : Yep . Professor B : Yeah . No . I think Dave { disfmarker } Dave knows all these things , of course . An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gon na do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time . PhD D : Right . Mm - hmm . Grad A : But I { disfmarker } I know that { pause } generally their first priority has been for backed up disk . And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is uh the back { disfmarker } the { pause } back up system , rather than on new disk . PhD D : Mmm . Mmm . Grad A : So . Which { disfmarker } Professor B : Well . So . But this { disfmarker } this is a very specific question for me . Basically , we can easily get { pause } one to four disks , I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it , it 's no big deal . Uh , but the question is where they go , and I do n't think we can solve that here , you just have to ask him . PhD D : Maybe we can put some disks in the { disfmarker } in that back room there . Grad A : Yeah really . Professor B : Attach to { disfmarker } Grad A : Popcorn . Professor B : Yeah ? PhD D : To the machine that collects the data . So then you could , at least temporarily , store stuff there . Grad A : Yeah , it 's just { disfmarker } It 's not on the net , so it 's a little { pause } awkward PhD D : The only { disfmarker } PhD F : Hmm . PhD D : What do you mean it 's not on the net ? Grad A : It 's not { disfmarker } PhD C : It 's not bad . Grad A : It 's behind lots of fire walls that do n't allow any services through except S S PhD D : Oh because it 's { disfmarker } because it 's an ACIRI machine ? Grad A : Yep . Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : Oh , oh oh . Grad A : And also on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net , but Who knows when that will happen ? PhD D : But that ca n't be that hard . PhD F : That might be a good short term solution , though . PhD D : I mean { disfmarker } Grad A : No , the { disfmarker } the problem with that apparently is that they do n't currently have a wire running to that back room { pause } that goes anywhere near one of the ICSI routers . PhD D : Oh , Grad A : So , they actually have to run a wire somewhere . Professor B : Yeah . Yeah , e again , you know , any one of these things is certainly not a big deal . If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } jus every ever everybody { disfmarker } everybody has a { disfmarker } has { disfmarker } Grad A : But Dave has to do all of them . Professor B : Well all of us have long lists of different things we 're doing . But at any rate I think that there 's a { disfmarker } there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need and I think we need a { disfmarker } a conversation with { disfmarker } Uh , maybe { disfmarker } maybe after { disfmarker } after tea or something you and I can go down and { disfmarker } and talk to him about it Just say `` wha you know , what should we do right now ? `` PhD F : How long is David gon na be gone ? Professor B : Uh , eleven days or something ? Grad A : Oh my ! Professor B : Yeah basically tomorrow and all of { pause } the week after . Grad A : And that 's all I have . Professor B : Um { disfmarker } Let 's see . The only oth thing { disfmarker } other thing I was gon na add was that um { disfmarker } uh , I talked briefly to Mari and uh we had { vocalsound } both been busy with other things so we have n't really connected that much since the { pause } last meeting we had here but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next . And I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I wanted to make it , um after the next one of these meetings , so something that we wan na do next meeting is { disfmarker } is uh to put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , um , that we 've done . I mean just sort of bulletize I mean o e do do I can { disfmarker } I can dream up text but { pause } this is basically gon na lead to the annual report . So { pause } Um { disfmarker } If w PhD D : Mm - hmm . Grad A : This is the fifteenth ? So just a week from tomorrow ? Professor B : Um , that would Grad A : OK . Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . So , uh , we can { disfmarker } This { disfmarker } So that 's an { disfmarker } PhD D : Is this got ta be in the morning ? Professor B : Um { disfmarker } PhD D : Or { disfmarker } Because you know I { disfmarker } Fridays I have to leave uh like around uh two . So if it could be before that would be be Professor B : No , no but I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I do n't need other folks for the meeting . I can do it . A A All I 'm saying is that on { disfmarker } PhD D : Oh , OK , alright . Oh I 'm sorry , I misunderstood . Professor B : Yeah so what I meant was on the me this meeting { pause } if I wa something I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I 'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wan na help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so I can tell her . PhD D : I thought you are { disfmarker } OK . Alright . Mm - hmm . Professor B : I think I have a pretty good idea PhD D : OK . Professor B : but { disfmarker } but um { disfmarker } Uh , and then the next day uh , late in the day I 'll be having that { disfmarker } that discussion with her . PhD D : Mmm . Professor B : Um . So . PhD D : Um { disfmarker } Uh { disfmarker } One thing { disfmarker } I mean { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } in past meetings we had um also a you know various { disfmarker } variously talked about the um work that w uh was happening sort of on the { disfmarker } on the recognition side Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD D : um but is n't necessarily related to meetings uh specifically . So . Um . And I wondered whether we should maybe have um a separate meeting and between you know , whoever 's interested in that because I feel that uh there 's plenty of stuff to talk about but it would be sort of um maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting if uh { disfmarker } Professor B : Think so ? PhD D : Well , it 's that { disfmarker } It 's just gon na be ver very boring for people who are not you know , sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system . Grad A : I 'm interested . Professor B : Well , OK , so how many { disfmarker } how many people here would not be interested in uh { disfmarker } in a meeting about recognition ? PhD C : Me too . PhD F : Jane may not be . Grad A : Jane , I think . PhD C : Yep . PhD D : Well I know { disfmarker } Well , Jane an Well you mean in a separate meeting or ha ha talking about it in this { disfmarker } Grad A : No . If we talked about it in this meeting . PhD F : He 's wondering how much overlap there will be . Professor B : Yeah , so you 're su PhD D : OK . Professor B : So . PhD D : So , uh , uh , Liz and Jane probably . Professor B : OK , so we 're gon na have a guy 's meeting . PhD D : Uh . { vocalsound } Uh , if you wan na put it that way . PhD F : Good thing Liz is n't here . Professor B : Real { disfmarker } Grad E : Watch a ball game ? Professor B : Yeah , real { disfmarker } real { disfmarker } real men { vocalsound } `` Real men do decoding `` or something like that . PhD F : Do n't listen to this , Liz . PhD D : Right . Professor B : Uh . PhD D : I mean it it 's sort of { disfmarker } I mean when { disfmarker } when the talk is about data collection stuff , sometimes I 've { disfmarker } you know , I { disfmarker } I 'm bored . Professor B : Yeah . Grad A : The { disfmarker } Nod off ? PhD D : So it 's I c I can sympathize with them not wanting to { disfmarker } i to { disfmarker } to be uh { disfmarker } you know { disfmarker } If { disfmarker } I cou you know { disfmarker } this could { disfmarker } Professor B : It 's cuz { pause } y you have a { disfmarker } So you need a better developed feminine side . PhD D : I 'm Professor B : There 's probably gon na be a lot of `` bleeps `` in this meeting . PhD D : not sure I wan na { disfmarker } Grad A : Yeah , I would as { comment } I would guess . Professor B : Uh . Um . PhD D : Yeah and { disfmarker } Professor B : I think it must be { pause } uh nearing the end of the week . Um . { vocalsound } Yeah . I { disfmarker } You know , I { disfmarker } I 've heard some comments about like this . That m could be . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : I mean the { disfmarker } Um . { vocalsound } U PhD D : And we do n't have to do it every week . PhD F : Could we { disfmarker } PhD D : We could do it every other week or so . You know , whatev or whenever we feel like we { disfmarker } PhD F : Right , I was { disfmarker } Why do n't we alternate this meeting every other week ? Grad A : Or just alternate the focus . PhD F : Tha - That 's what I mean . Grad A : Yeah , so on even weeks have { pause } basic { pause } on data . Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : We could do that , yeah . PhD F : Yeah . PhD D : I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } Personally I 'd { disfmarker } I 'm not in favor of more meetings . Um . { vocalsound } Because , uh . Professor B : Right . Grad A : I am . PhD D : You know . Grad A : Oh sor PhD F : But I do I do n't { disfmarker } I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we do n't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder . PhD D : Right . Grad A : Well , except that we keep going for our full time . PhD F : So if we did that { disfmarker } PhD C : Yep . PhD F : Well , cuz we get into these other topics . Grad A : Yeah . PhD D : We feel { disfmarker } We feel obligated to collect more data . Grad E : Yeah . Grad A : Ugh . PhD F : Yeah . Grad A : I do n't . PhD F : So if we could alternate the focus of the meeting { disfmarker } Grad A : Let 's read digits and go . Professor B : Why do n't we just start with that . PhD D : ummh . { comment } ummh . { comment } OK . Professor B : And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : But I { disfmarker } I think that 's a great idea . Uh . So uh . Um . Let 's chat about it with Liz and Jane { pause } when we get a chance , see what they think and { disfmarker } PhD D : Mm - hmm . PhD F : Yeah that would be good . I mean Andreas and I have various talks in the halls PhD D : Mm - hmm . PhD F : and there 's lots of things , you know , details and stuff that would I think people 'd be interested in and I 'd { disfmarker } you know , where do we go from here kind of things and { disfmarker } So , it would be good . Professor B : Yeah , and you 're { disfmarker } you 're attending { pause } the uh { disfmarker } the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have { disfmarker } you have probably one of the best { disfmarker } you and I , I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two . Grad A : Bridge . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : We are doing recognition in both of them . So . PhD F : Mm - hmm . PhD D : Right . Professor B : Uh . Grad A : OK ? PhD D : So um . So { disfmarker } so we could talk a little bit about that now if { disfmarker } if there 's some time . Grad A : No , no that would be for next week . PhD D : Um I jus So the latest result was that um um yot I tested the uh { disfmarker } the sort of final version of the PLP configuration um on development test data for { disfmarker } for this year 's Hub - five test set . Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD D : And the recognition performance was exactly , and I mean exactly up to the { disfmarker } you know , the first decimal , same as with the uh Mel Cepstra front - end . Grad A : Mmm . PhD F : For both females and males ? PhD D : Yes . Uh , well i there was a little bit of a { disfmarker } PhD F : Oh ! PhD D : i overall . They { disfmarker } They were { disfmarker } The males I think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really . PhD F : Mm - hmm . Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD D : I mean definitely not significant . PhD F : Mm - hmm . PhD D : And then the really nice thing was that if { disfmarker } if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement . Grad A : Wow . Just with ROVER ? PhD D : So . t With N - best ROVER , which is like our { vocalsound } new and improved version of ROVER . Grad A : Mm - hmm . PhD D : Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems { pause } to { pause } mmm , uh { pause } c combine that . Professor B : So except { disfmarker } I mean the only key difference between the two really is the kind of smoothing at the end which is the auto - regressive versus the cepstral truncation . PhD D : Yeah . Professor B : OK . PhD D : And , the { disfmarker } PhD F : But a percent and a half ? Grad A : Yeah , it 's pretty { pause } impressive . PhD F : That 's { disfmarker } PhD D : And { disfmarker } And so uh after I told the { disfmarker } my uh colleagues at SRI about that , you know , now they definitely want to , you know , uh , have a { disfmarker } Next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh , you know , basically a at least the system combination . Um , and , you know , why not ? Professor B : Sure , why not ? PhD D : Uh . { vocalsound } So . Grad A : We clearly got ta add a few more features , though . PhD D : Uh w what do you mean ? More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ? Grad A : No , uh front - end features . You know we did PLP and Mel Cepstra . Let 's , you know , try RASTA and MSG , and { disfmarker } PhD D : Oh I mean { disfmarker } Yeah . Well Right . So , we cou Yeah . That 's { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the the { disfmarker } There 's one thing uh { disfmarker } I mean you do n't want to overdo it because y every front - end { disfmarker } You know , if you { disfmarker } you know you basically multiply your effort by N , where N is a number of different systems PhD F : Oh . Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD D : and { disfmarker } Um . So . So one { disfmarker } one compromise would be to { disfmarker } only to have the { disfmarker } everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems and combine the results and that 's a fairly painless um thing . Professor B : Mmm . An PhD D : So . PhD F : Do you think we 'd still get the one and a half uh { disfmarker } PhD D : I { disfmarker } I think so . Yeah . Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower and so if { disfmarker } You know , maybe it 's only one percent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing . PhD F : Mm - hmm . PhD D : So . Um { pause } Jus - You know , just wanted to let you know that that 's working out very nicely . Grad A : Cool . PhD D : And then we had some results on { pause } digits , uh , with um { disfmarker } We { disfmarker } We { disfmarker } So this was uh really { comment } { disfmarker } really sort of just to get Dave going with his um experiments . Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD D : And so , uh . But as a result , um , you know , we were sort of wondering why is the Hub - five system doing so well on the digits . Professor B : Right . PhD D : And the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set . Grad A : Right . Professor B : Including digits I gather , yeah . PhD D : And you c And { disfmarker } Not all of { disfmarker } No it 's actually , digits is only a maybe a fifth of it . Professor B : A fifth of it is how much ? PhD D : The rest is { disfmarker } is read { disfmarker } is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that . Professor B : Right . But a fi a fifth is how much ? PhD D : A fifth would be maybe uh two hours something . Professor B : Yeah , so I mean that 's actually not that different from the { pause } amount of training that there was . PhD D : Right . Professor B : So . PhD D : But it definitely helps to have the other read data in there Professor B : Oh yeah PhD D : because we 're doing { disfmarker } Professor B : w PhD D : You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti uh TIMIT { disfmarker } { comment } uh not TIMIT uh TI - digits , Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD D : which is only what two hours something ? Professor B : Right . Grad A : I do n't know . PhD D : So . Uh , more read speech data definitely helps . And you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty . Professor B : Yeah that was the interesting thing . PhD D : That 's e Professor B : Because { disfmarker } because uh , it was apparent if you put in a bunch more data it would be better , PhD D : That was e Right , right . Professor B : but { disfmarker } but uh . PhD D : Right . PhD F : Well is there even more read speech data around ? PhD D : Oh , yeah . So we only { disfmarker } for the Hub - five training , we 're only using uh a fairly small subset of the Macrophone { pause } database . PhD F : Mm - hmm . PhD D : Um , so , you could beef that up and probably do even better . Grad A : I could also put in { pause } uh focus condition zero from Hub - four from Broadcast News , which is mostly prepared speech . PhD F : Mm - hmm . Grad A : It 's not exactly read speech but it 's pretty darn close . PhD D : Yeah . Yeah . Right . Well , I mean that 's plenty of read speech data . I mean , Wall Street Journal , { pause } uh , take one example . Grad A : Yeah . That 's right . PhD D : But um . So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the { disfmarker } the digit recognizers to { disfmarker } to use uh something other than TI - digits . Grad A : Yeah . Professor B : Well they been using TIMIT . PhD D : OK . Professor B : That { disfmarker } Uh . { pause } They { disfmarker } they uh { disfmarker } they experimented for a while with a bunch of different databases with French and Spanish and so forth cuz they 're multilingual tests PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : and { disfmarker } and uh , um , { disfmarker } and actually the best results they got wa were uh using TIMIT . Grad A : Hmm . Professor B : Uh { disfmarker } But uh { disfmarker } which { disfmarker } So that 's what they 're { disfmarker } they 're using now . PhD D : Mmm . Professor B : But { disfmarker } but yeah certainly if we , um { disfmarker } If we knew what the structure of what we 're doing there was . I mean there 's still a bunch of messing around with different kinds of uh noise robustness algorithms . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : So we do n't know exactly which combination we 're gon na be going with . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : Once we know , then { disfmarker } the trainable parts of it { disfmarker } it 'd be great to run lots of { disfmarker } lots of stuff through . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Right . Well , that was that . And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system and { disfmarker } You wan na { disfmarker } { vocalsound } You wan na see where that stands ? PhD F : Well , I 'm { disfmarker } PhD D :  PhD F : Yeah , so Andreas uh brought over the uh alignments that the SRI system uses . And so I 'm in the process of um converting those alignments into uh label files that we can use to train uh a new net with . And uh so then I 'll train the net . And . PhD D : An - And one side effect of that would be that it 's { disfmarker } um that the phone set would change . So the MLP would be trained on I think only forty - six or forty - eight { disfmarker } PhD F : Right . Eight . PhD D : forty - eight phones ? PhD F : Mm - hmm . PhD D : Uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that { disfmarker } that we 've been using so far . Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : And that { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } that will probably help , actually , PhD F : So it 's a little different ? PhD D : because um the fewer dimensions uh e the less trouble probably with the { disfmarker } as far as just the um , um { disfmarker } Just { disfmarker } You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features . And so you h have to multiply everything by two or three . And so , you know , fewer dimensions in the { pause } phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view . Professor B : Sure . Although we { disfmarker } I mean , it 's not that many fewer and { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and we take a KLT anyway so we could { disfmarker } PhD D : Right . Exactly . Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : So { disfmarker } so that was the other thing . And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end . So that would mean just doing the top I do n't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions . Professor B : Yeah , and I think { disfmarker } and we sh again check { disfmarker } we should check with Stephane . My impression was that when we did that before that had very little { disfmarker } uh he did n't lose very much . PhD D : Right . PhD F : By just taking the top whatever ? Grad A : Yep . Professor B : Yeah yeah . PhD D : But then { disfmarker } And then something { disfmarker } Once we have the new M L P trained up , uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know , those features uh and uh retrain MLP and also the you know , the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system . Professor B : And the b And the base u starting off with the base of the alignments that you got from i from a pretty decent system . PhD D : Exactly . PhD F : Right . PhD D : Yeah . So that would basically give us a , um , more { disfmarker } hopefully a { disfmarker } a better system Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : um because { disfmarker } you know , compared to what Eric did a while ago , where he trained up , I think , a system based on Broadcast News and then uh tra retraining it on Switchboard or s uh and { disfmarker } Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : But he { disfmarker } I think he d he did n't { disfmarker } he probably did n't use all the training data that was available . And his dictionary probably was n't as tuned to um conversational speech as { disfmarker } as the { disfmarker } as ours is . Professor B : That 's { disfmarker } That 's certainly one thing , yeah . PhD D : So . Professor B : Uh . Yeah . PhD D : And the dictionary made a huge difference . Uh . We { disfmarker } we made some improvements to the dictionary 's uh { disfmarker } to the dictionary about two years ago which resulted in a { disfmarker } uh something like a four percent absolute error rate reduction on Switchboard , which { disfmarker } Professor B : Well the other thing is , dipping { pause } deep into history and into uh our resource management days , when we were collaborating with SRI before , PhD D : Mm - hmm . Mmm . Professor B : uh it was { disfmarker } I think , it is was a really key uh starting point for us that we actually got our alignment . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : When we were working together we got our initial alignments from Decipher , uh { pause } at the time . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Yeah . Professor B : Uh . { pause } And . Later we got away from it because { disfmarker } because once we had decent systems going then it was { disfmarker } it was typically better to use our own systems PhD F : Yeah . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : cuz they were self consistent but { disfmarker } but certainly to start off when we were trying to recover from our initial hundred and forty percent error uh rate . Uh . { vocalsound } But that was a { disfmarker } that was a good { disfmarker } good { disfmarker } good way to start . PhD D : Yeah . Professor B : And we 're not quite that bad with our { disfmarker } our Switchboard systems but it was { disfmarker } they certainly are n't as good as SRI 's , PhD D : OK . Yeah . Professor B : so { disfmarker } PhD D : Right . PhD F : W What is the performance on s the best Switchboard system that we 've done ? Roughly ? Professor B : Well , the hybrid system we never got better than about fifty percent { pause } error . And uh it was { disfmarker } I think there 's just a whole lot of things that uh no one ever had time for . We never did really fix up the dictionary . Uh we always had a list of a half dozen things that we were gon na do and { disfmarker } and a lot of them were pretty simple and we never did . PhD D : Yeah . Mmm . Professor B : Uh , we never did an never did any adaptation PhD D : But that w Even that { disfmarker } that number { disfmarker } Professor B : uh , we never did any { disfmarker } PhD D : Right . And { disfmarker } And that number I think was on Switchboard - one data , right ? Where the error rate now is in the twenties . Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . PhD D : So , um . Professor B : So we were { disfmarker } Yeah . We were probably at least a factor or two off . PhD D : That 's yet s Right . Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : So it would be { disfmarker } So it would be good t to sort of r re uh { disfmarker } Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do . Professor B : Yeah . But I think { disfmarker } again it 's { disfmarker } Yeah . It 's the conver it 's the s conversational speech bit . Because our { disfmarker } our Broadcast News system is actually pretty good . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : He knows . PhD D : Right . And the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M L P is trained up . Right ? Because it 's a pretty good um indicator of that . Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD D : So it 's sort of a sanity check of the M L P outputs { pause } before we go ahead and train up the { disfmarker } uh you know , use them as a basis for the tandem system . PhD F : Mm - hmm . Professor B : Yeah . It 'll still probably be worse . I mean , it 's { disfmarker } it 'd be context independent and so on . PhD D : No . Sure . Not { disfmarker } PhD F : Should we { disfmarker } Should we bother with um using the net before doing uh embedded training ? Professor B : But . PhD D : But { disfmarker } PhD F : I mean should { disfmarker } should we even use that ? PhD D : Oh { pause } oh that 's a good question . PhD F : Or should I just go straight to { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah , we { disfmarker } we were n't sure whether it 's worth to just use the alignments um from the S R I recognizer or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign . Grad A : Try it . You run it ? Keep { disfmarker } keep both versions ? See which one 's better ? Professor B : Uh , yeah . I mean . I think I agree with Ad I mean basically you would then { disfmarker } You proceed with the embedded training . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : It 's gon na take you a while to train at this net anyway . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Right . Professor B : And while it 's training you may as well test the one you have and see how it did . PhD D : OK . Alright . PhD F : Mmm . Grad A : I could make arguments either way . You know , it 's { disfmarker } PhD D : But { disfmarker } But so I { disfmarker } Grad A : Sort of given up guessing . PhD D : Well but i But in your experience I mean uh have you seen big improvements in s on some tasks with embedded training ? Or was it sort of small - ish uh improvements that you got Professor B : Uh well . It depended on the task . I mean I think in this one I would sort of expect it to be important PhD D : Right . Professor B : because we 're coming from uh , alignments that were achieved with an extremely different system . PhD D : That are from another { disfmarker } Right . Grad A : Although , I mean we 've done it with { disfmarker } When we were combining with the Cambridge recurrent neural net , embedded training made it worse . PhD D : Right . Professor B : Uh . Grad A : Which I 've never figured out . Professor B : Right . But I mean i Grad A : I think it 's a bug . PhD D : So you { disfmarker } you started training with outputs from a { disfmarker } with alignments that were generated by the Cambridge uh system ? Grad A : Yep . PhD D : And then { disfmarker } Uh . Grad A : Yeah . Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : Hmm . Well , that might probably just { disfmarker } Hmm . That was probably because your initial system { disfmarker } I mean your system was ba worse than Cambridge 's . And you { disfmarker } Um . Professor B : Was it ? I do n't think it was . Grad A : No they were { disfmarker } they were comparable . PhD D : It was n't ? Professor B : No . Grad A : They were very close . PhD D : Really ? Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : That 's weird . Professor B : Excuse me ? PhD D : That 's { disfmarker } That 's weird . Grad A : That 's what I said . Professor B : Oh ! PhD D : No I mean it 's weird that it did { disfmarker } I 'm sorry . It 's w It 's weird that it got worse . PhD F : That 's ambiguous . Professor B : Um . No . Uh . Tha - u we we 've see I mean { disfmarker } and wi with the numbers { disfmarker } OGI numbers task we 've seen a number of times people doing embedded trainings and things not getting better . PhD D : Oh actually it 's not that weird because we have seen { disfmarker } We have seen cases where acoustic { disfmarker } retraining the acoustic models after some other change made matters worse rather than better . Professor B : Yeah . It just { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah . Professor B : But I But I would { disfmarker } I would suspect that something that { disfmarker } that had um a very different Um feature set , for instance { disfmarker } I mean they were using pretty diff similar feature sets to us . Grad A : Yep . Professor B : I { disfmarker } I would expect that something that had a different feature set would { disfmarker } would uh benefit from { disfmarker } PhD D : Mm - hmm . PhD F : What about uh hidden unit size { pause } on this . Professor B : Oh , wait a minute , and the other thing uh , PhD F : Oh . Professor B : sorry , it was { disfmarker } the other thing is that what was in common { comment } to the Cambridge system and our system is they both were training posteriors . Grad A : Right . Ah yeah . Professor B : So I mean , uh , that 's another pretty big difference Grad A : That 's another big difference . Professor B : and uh , one bac at least { disfmarker } Back at { disfmarker } PhD D : You mean with soft targets ? Or { disfmarker } ? Sorry , I 'm sor I missed { disfmarker } What { disfmarker } What 's the key issue here ? Professor B : Oh , that uh both the Cambridge system and our system were { disfmarker } were training { pause } posteriors . And if we 're { disfmarker } we 're coming from alignments coming from the SRI system , it 's a likelihood - based system . So { disfmarker } so that 's another difference . PhD D : Yeah . Professor B : I mean . You know , there 's diffe different front - end different { disfmarker } different uh , um , training criterion { disfmarker } Uh , I would think that in a that an embedded { pause } uh { pause } embedded uh training would have at least a good shot of improving it some more . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : But we do n't know . PhD D : OK . Professor B : You gon na say something ? PhD F : Yeah . I was wondering uh you know what size net I should { disfmarker } Anybody have any intuitions or suggestions ? Professor B : Uh , how much training data ? PhD F : Well , I was gon na start off with the small train set . Professor B : And how { disfmarker } How many hours is that ? PhD F : That 's why I was { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I 'm not sure how much that is . PhD D : Uh , I think that has about { disfmarker } Well i you 'd { disfmarker } would be gender - dependent training , right ? So { disfmarker } So I think it 's { disfmarker } uh that 's about mmm , something like thirty hours . PhD F : Gender - dependent , yeah . PhD D : Thirty hours per gender . PhD F : Thirty hours . Grad A : I 'm not sure what this 'll mean . PhD F : In the small training set ? Grad A : Hello ? PhD D : I { disfmarker } I think so . I 'll { disfmarker } Grad A : Excuse me ? PhD D : It 's definitely less than a hundred { disfmarker } Grad A : Alright . PhD D : You know , it 's more like { disfmarker } like thirty forty hours something like that . Grad A : Wrong number . PhD F : They called to tell us that ? Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : Yeah . Professor B : Um . So . Uh . after run PhD F : I mean , I did n't want to do too big , Professor B : Right . So PhD F : just { disfmarker } Professor B : At least a couple thousand hidden units . I mean . It 's { disfmarker } it 's th the thing I 'll { disfmarker } I 'll think about it a little more PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : but it { disfmarker } it 'd be toss up between two thousand and four thousand . PhD F : Mmm . Professor B : You definitely would n't want the eight thousand . It 's m It 's more than { disfmarker } PhD F : And a thousand is too small ? Professor B : Oh let me think about it , but I think that { disfmarker } that uh th at some point there 's diminishing returns . I mean it does n't actually get worse , typically , PhD F : Mm - hmm . Grad A : Mm - hmm . Professor B : but it { disfmarker } but { disfmarker } but there is diminishing returns and you 're doubling { pause } the amount of time . PhD D : Remember you 'll have a smaller output layer so there 's gon na be fewer parameters there . Grad A : But not by a lot . Professor B : Not by much . PhD D : And then { disfmarker } Professor B : Fifty s Fifty four to forty eight ? Grad A : Vast majority is from the input unit . Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : OK . Yeah . Professor B : Yeah . It 'll have a very tiny effect . Grad A : Right , because you used the context windows and so the input to hidden is much , much larger . Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : Oh I see , I see , yeah , of course . Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : Yeah . It 's negligible , OK . Professor B : Yeah , so it 's { disfmarker } it 'd be way , way less than ten percent of the difference . PhD D : Uh - huh . Professor B : Uh . There 's uh { disfmarker } How bi how big Let 's see . What am I trying to think of ? PhD F : The { disfmarker } The net that { disfmarker } that we did use already { pause } uh was eight thousand hidden units and that 's the one that Eric trained up . Professor B : Right . And that was trained up on uh like a hundred and forty hours of { disfmarker } of speech . PhD D : Was that gender - dependent or independent ? PhD F : Gender - dependent . Professor B : Oh . So that would be like trained on s sixty or seventy hours . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : So , uh , yeah definitely not the one thousand uh { disfmarker } two thousand fr I mean the four thousand will be better and the two thousand will be almost { disfmarker } will be faster and almost as good . Grad A : It 'll be faster . Professor B : So . PhD F : Yeah . PhD D : Mm - hmm . PhD F : Maybe I 'll start off with two thousand just to see . Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : OK . PhD F : OK . Professor B : Yeah , thirty hours is like a hundred and ten thousand uh seconds . Uh , so that 's like eleven { disfmarker } eleven million frames . And a two thousand hidden unit net is uh I guess about seven , eight hundred thousand parameters . So that 's probably { disfmarker } That 's probably fine . I mean a four thousand is well within the range that you could benefit from but the two thousand 'd be faster so { disfmarker } PhD D : Right . I actually have to go . Professor B : Alright . PhD D : So . Professor B : Uncle Bernie 's rule is ten to one . Bernie Woodrow 's Rule of { disfmarker } yeah { disfmarker } Uncle Bernie { disfmarker } yeah . Grad A : We 're just waiting for you to leave . Professor B : Yes sir . Grad A : Anything else ? Professor B : Nah . Grad A : OK . Professor B : Since we have nothing to talk about we only talked for an hour . Grad A : If { disfmarker } Professor B : So . Grad A : yeah that 's right . PhD C : Yeah . Grad A : Uh , well , we started late . PhD F : Transcript Professor B : de - ba - de . de - ba - de That 's all folks ! 
Query : Summarize the discussion on storage disks and computer connections PhD C : Yeah . Grad A : And , my original intention was like we would just delete them as we needed more space , but unfortunately we 're in the position where we have to deal with all the meeting data { pause } all at once , in a lot of different ways . PhD C : Yeah . PhD F : Oh there 's a lot of transcribers , too . Grad A : Yeah , there 're a lot of transcribers , PhD C : Yeah . Grad A : so all of those need to be expanded , and then people are doing chunking and I want to do uh , uh , uh , the permission forms , PhD F : Mm - hmm . PhD C : An PhD F : Right . Grad A : so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around . Um { disfmarker } And Jane was gon na talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it . One of the things I was thinking is we { disfmarker } we just got these hundred { disfmarker } alright , excuse me { disfmarker } ten , uh SPARC - Blade SUN - Blades . Professor B : Did they come in ? PhD F : SUN - Blades . PhD D : Yeah . PhD F : Yeah . They came in the other day . Grad A : They came in but they 're not set up yet . Professor B : Oh . Grad A : And so it seems to me we could hang scratch disk on those { pause } because they 'll be in the machine room , they 'll be on the fast connection to the rest of the machines . And if we just need un - backed - up space , we could just hang disks off them . PhD F : Well , is there { disfmarker } Why not just hang them off of Abbott , is there a { disfmarker } Grad A : Because there 's no more room in the disk racks on Abbott . Professor B : Yeah . PhD F : Ah . Professor B : Were n't we gon na get { disfmarker } PhD F : Ah , I see . Professor B : Well , maybe it should get another rack . PhD D : But you still need to store the disks somehow . Grad A : Well , but the SUN - Blades have spare drive bays . PhD D : So { disfmarker } Grad A : Just put them in . PhD F : You can put two { disfmarker } PhD D : Oh you mean you put them inside the pizza boxes for the { disfmarker } Grad A : Sure . PhD C : Internal . Yeah . Grad A : Yeah . Cuz the SUN { disfmarker } uh , these SUN - Blades take commodity hard drives . PhD D : Oh . Grad A : So you can just go out and buy a PC hard drive and stick it in . PhD D : Mmm . Professor B : But if Abbott is going to be our disk server it { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } file server { comment } it seems like we would want to get it , uh , a second disk rack or something . PhD D : Plus we 're talking about buying a second dis uh , file server . Grad A : Well , I mean there are lots of long term solutions . What I 'm looking for is where do we s expand the next meeting ? PhD C : Yep . PhD D : I see { vocalsound } { pause } Oh , I see . Professor B : Well , for the next meeting you might be out of luck with those ten , might n't you ? Uh , you know Dave Johnson is gone for , like , ten days , Grad A : Oh , I did n't know he had left already . Professor B : Uh , well , tonight . Grad A : Oh , oh well . PhD D : You mean he wo n't set up the { disfmarker } mmm . Professor B : I do n't know . Grad E : How much space do you need for these ? Professor B : I do n't know what his schedule is . Grad A : You { disfmarker } we need about a gig per meeting . Professor B : I 'm just saying he 's gone . PhD C : Yep . PhD F : I { disfmarker } I thi Grad E : I have um { disfmarker } I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . Grad A : Alright ! What 's your computer 's name ? Grad E : So { disfmarker } Uh , Samosa . Professor B : You had an eighteen gigabyte drive . Grad E : Yeah , I had . Well it 's about { disfmarker } I think there 's about twelve gig left . Grad A : So it { disfmarker } And you have an X drives installed ? OK . Grad E : Yeah . So , I did n't realize it was so critical . Grad A : And you 're o you 're offering ? Grad E : I mean I 'm not doing anything on it right now until I get new meetings to transcri or that are { disfmarker } new transcriptions coming in I really ca n't do anything . Grad A : OK . Grad E : Um not that I ca n't do anything , I jus PhD F : I { disfmarker } I jus I just gave Thilo some { disfmarker } about ten gigs , the last ten gigs of space that there was on { disfmarker } on uh Abbott . Uh { disfmarker } And uh { disfmarker } So but that { disfmarker } But { disfmarker } Grad A : Which one was that , X { pause } G ? X { pause } G ? PhD C : XG . PhD F : XG . Grad A : OK . PhD D : XG ? PhD F : Yeah . PhD D : That 's also where we store the { disfmarker } The uh Hub - five training set waveforms , PhD C : Oops . Grad A : But that wo n't be getting any bigger , PhD D : right ? PhD F : No . Grad A : will it ? PhD F : I do n't think that 's on XG . PhD D : Right . PhD F : On XG is only Carmen and Du - and Stephane 's disk . PhD C : It 's { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD D : But I 've also been storing { disfmarker } I 've been storing the feature files there and I guess I can s start deleting some because we now know what the best features are Grad E : Well { disfmarker } PhD D : and we wo n't be using the old ones anymore . Grad E : I have a lot of space , though . PhD F : Yeah , I do I do n't think it was on XG . PhD D : Uh { disfmarker } Oh thats XA { disfmarker } Oh that 's X { disfmarker } PhD C : Is n't that XH ? PhD F : I th Grad A : Not { disfmarker } not for long . Grad E : I have a lot of space and it 's not { disfmarker } it 's n There 's very little uh { disfmarker } Yeah not for long . PhD D : Maybe I 'm confu Grad E : But I mean it 's not going f PhD D : Oh no I 'm sorry . Grad E : It 's not being used often at all . PhD C : But I 'm using XH { disfmarker } H , too . Grad A : Yeah , it 's probably { disfmarker } Probably only about four gig is on X { disfmarker } on your X drive , PhD C : So . PhD D : Oh OK . Grad A : but we 'll definitely take it up if you { disfmarker } Grad E : I th PhD D : I think you 're right . It 's XH and D { disfmarker } Grad E : I think it 's about four or five gig cuz I have four meetings on there , PhD D : The b I 'm also using DG I got that confused . Grad E : three or four meetings . PhD D : OK . Grad A : Great . Grad E : So . Grad A : OK , so that will get us through the next couple days . Professor B : We need { disfmarker } We need another gigaquad . Grad A : Yep . At least . Professor B : There should { disfmarker } I d There should just be a b I should have a button . Grad A : The `` more disk space `` button ? Professor B : Just press { disfmarker } Press each meeting saying `` we need more disk space `` { vocalsound } `` this week `` . Grad A : Yep . Professor B : Skip the rest of the conversation . PhD F : Well we 've collected so far something like uh sixty - five meetings . Professor B : And { disfmarker } And how much does each meeting take ? PhD F : And it 's about a gig uncompressed . PhD C : It 's { disfmarker } It 's a little bit more as I usually do n't { disfmarker } do not uncompress the { disfmarker } all of the PZM and the PDA things . PhD F : Is a little more ? PhD C : So . PhD F : Right , yeah so if you uncompressed everything it 's even more . PhD C : It 's { disfmarker } Yeah . One point five or something . PhD F : U Uh compressed how much are they ? Like { disfmarker } Grad A : Half a gig . For all of them . PhD F : About half ? PhD C : Yeah . Yeah . Yep . PhD F : So we 're definitely are storing you know , all of those . So there 's what thirty some gig of just meetings so far ? Professor B : So - so So maybe there 's a hundred { pause } gig or something . Or { disfmarker } I mean . Cuz we { disfmarker } we have the uncompressed around also . PhD F : Mm - hmm . Right . Professor B : So it 's like { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . PhD F : Right . Well we { disfmarker } We have n't uncompressed all the meetings , but { disfmarker } Grad A : I would like to . Professor B : Yeah . Well I mean it 's { disfmarker } the they really are cheap . I mean it 's just a question of figuring out where they should be and hanging them , Grad A : Yep . PhD F : Right . Professor B : but But uh , we could { disfmarker } You know , if you want to get four disks , get four disks . I mean it 's { disfmarker } it 's small { disfmarker } I mean these things ar are just a few hundred dollars . PhD F : Yeah . Well I sent that message out to , I guess , you and Dave asking for { disfmarker } if we could get some disk . Professor B : Yeah . PhD F : I s I sent this out a { disfmarker } a day ago Grad A : And put it where ? Professor B : Right . PhD F : but { disfmarker } and Dave did n't respond so I don I do n't know how the whole process works . I mean does he just go out and get them and { disfmarker } if it 's OK , and { disfmarker } Grad A : Yep . PhD F : So I was assuming he was gon na take over { pause } that . But he 's probably too busy given that he 's leaving . Professor B : Yeah , I think you need a direct conversation with him . And just { vocalsound } say an - e just ask him that , you know , wha what should you do . And in my answer back was `` are you sure you just want one ? `` So I mean I think { pause } that what you want to do is plan ahead a little bit and figure `` well , here 's what we pi figure on doing for the next few months `` . PhD F : Yeah . Grad A : Wa - a I know what they want . The sysadmins would prefer to have one external drive per machine . So they do n't want to stack up external drives . Professor B : Yeah . Grad A : Um { disfmarker } { pause } And then they want everything else in the machine room . Professor B : Right . Grad A : So the question is where are you gon na hang them ? PhD F : Mm - hmm . I do n't know what the space situation is in the machine room . Grad A : Right . PhD F : So . Professor B : Right . So this is a question that 's pretty hard to solve without talking to Dave , PhD D : Th - The { disfmarker } PhD F : I think part of the reason why Dave ca n't get the { disfmarker } the new machines up is because he does n't have room in the machine room right now . Professor B : cuz it { disfmarker } PhD D : One { disfmarker } Mmm . Grad A : Yep . PhD D : One { disfmarker } One On - One thing to in to um t to do when you need to conserve space is PhD F : So he has to re - arrange a bunch of stuff . PhD D : I bet there are still some old , uh , like , nine gig disks , uh , around and you can probably consolidate them onto larger disks and { disfmarker } and you know recover the space . Grad A : Yep . Professor B : Yeah . No . I think Dave { disfmarker } Dave knows all these things , of course . An - and so , he always has a a lot of plans of things that he 's gon na do to make things better in many ways an and runs out of time . PhD D : Right . Mm - hmm . Grad A : But I { disfmarker } I know that { pause } generally their first priority has been for backed up disk . And so I think what he 's been concentrating on is uh the back { disfmarker } the { pause } back up system , rather than on new disk . PhD D : Mmm . Mmm . Grad A : So . Which { disfmarker } Professor B : Well . So . But this { disfmarker } this is a very specific question for me . Basically , we can easily get { pause } one to four disks , I mean you just go out and get four and we 've got the money for it , it 's no big deal . Uh , but the question is where they go , and I do n't think we can solve that here , you just have to ask him . PhD D : Maybe we can put some disks in the { disfmarker } in that back room there . Grad A : Yeah really . Professor B : Attach to { disfmarker } Grad A : Popcorn . Professor B : Yeah ? PhD D : To the machine that collects the data . So then you could , at least temporarily , store stuff there . Grad A : Yeah , it 's just { disfmarker } It 's not on the net , so it 's a little { pause } awkward PhD D : The only { disfmarker } PhD F : Hmm . PhD D : What do you mean it 's not on the net ? Grad A : It 's not { disfmarker } PhD C : It 's not bad . Grad A : It 's behind lots of fire walls that do n't allow any services through except S S PhD D : Oh because it 's { disfmarker } because it 's an ACIRI machine ? Grad A : Yep . Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : Oh , oh oh . Grad A : And also on the list is to get it into the normal ICSI net , but Who knows when that will happen ? PhD D : But that ca n't be that hard . PhD F : That might be a good short term solution , though . PhD D : I mean { disfmarker } Grad A : No , the { disfmarker } the problem with that apparently is that they do n't currently have a wire running to that back room { pause } that goes anywhere near one of the ICSI routers . PhD D : Oh , Grad A : So , they actually have to run a wire somewhere . Professor B : Yeah . Yeah , e again , you know , any one of these things is certainly not a big deal . If there was a person dedicated to doing it they would happen pretty easily but it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } jus every ever everybody { disfmarker } everybody has a { disfmarker } has { disfmarker } Grad A : But Dave has to do all of them . Professor B : Well all of us have long lists of different things we 're doing . But at any rate I think that there 's a { disfmarker } there 's a longer term thing and there 's immediate need and I think we need a { disfmarker } a conversation with { disfmarker } Uh , maybe { disfmarker } maybe after { disfmarker } after tea or something you and I can go down and { disfmarker } and talk to him about it Just say `` wha you know , what should we do right now ? `` PhD F : How long is David gon na be gone ? Professor B : Uh , eleven days or something ? Grad A : Oh my ! Professor B : Yeah basically tomorrow and all of { pause } the week after . Grad A : And that 's all I have . Professor B : Um { disfmarker } Let 's see . The only oth thing { disfmarker } other thing I was gon na add was that um { disfmarker } uh , I talked briefly to Mari and uh we had { vocalsound } both been busy with other things so we have n't really connected that much since the { pause } last meeting we had here but we agreed that we would have a telephone meeting the Friday after next . And I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I wanted to make it , um after the next one of these meetings , so something that we wan na do next meeting is { disfmarker } is uh to put together um , a kind of reasonable list for ourselves of what is it , um , that we 've done . I mean just sort of bulletize I mean o e do do I can { disfmarker } I can dream up text but { pause } this is basically gon na lead to the annual report . So { pause } Um { disfmarker } If w PhD D : Mm - hmm . Grad A : This is the fifteenth ? So just a week from tomorrow ? Professor B : Um , that would Grad A : OK . Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . So , uh , we can { disfmarker } This { disfmarker } So that 's an { disfmarker } PhD D : Is this got ta be in the morning ? Professor B : Um { disfmarker } PhD D : Or { disfmarker } Because you know I { disfmarker } Fridays I have to leave uh like around uh two . So if it could be before that would be be Professor B : No , no but I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I do n't need other folks for the meeting . I can do it . A A All I 'm saying is that on { disfmarker } PhD D : Oh , OK , alright . Oh I 'm sorry , I misunderstood . Professor B : Yeah so what I meant was on the me this meeting { pause } if I wa something I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I 'm making a major thing in the agenda is I wan na help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so I can tell her . 
Query : What did Grad E contribute to the discussion on storage disks ? Grad E : I have um { disfmarker } I have an eighteen gig drive hanging off of my computer . Grad A : Alright ! What 's your computer 's name ? Grad E : So { disfmarker } Uh , Samosa . Professor B : You had an eighteen gigabyte drive . Grad E : Yeah , I had . Well it 's about { disfmarker } I think there 's about twelve gig left . Grad A : So it { disfmarker } And you have an X drives installed ? OK . Grad E : Yeah .

Uh { disfmarker } And uh { disfmarker } So but that { disfmarker } But { disfmarker } Grad A : Which one was that , X { pause } G ? X { pause } G ? 
Query : What did the group think about Dave leaving ? Grad A : so I want those to be live , so there 's a lot of data that has to be around . Um { disfmarker } And Jane was gon na talk to , uh , Dave Johnson about it . One of the things I was thinking is we { disfmarker } we just got these hundred { disfmarker } alright , excuse me { disfmarker } ten , uh SPARC - Blade SUN - Blades .

Query : Summarize the discussion about scheduling meetings going forward PhD D : I thought you are { disfmarker } OK . Alright . Mm - hmm . Professor B : I think I have a pretty good idea PhD D : OK . Professor B : but { disfmarker } but um { disfmarker } Uh , and then the next day uh , late in the day I 'll be having that { disfmarker } that discussion with her . PhD D : Mmm . Professor B : Um . So . PhD D : Um { disfmarker } Uh { disfmarker } One thing { disfmarker } I mean { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } in past meetings we had um also a you know various { disfmarker } variously talked about the um work that w uh was happening sort of on the { disfmarker } on the recognition side Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD D : um but is n't necessarily related to meetings uh specifically . So . Um . And I wondered whether we should maybe have um a separate meeting and between you know , whoever 's interested in that because I feel that uh there 's plenty of stuff to talk about but it would be sort of um maybe the wrong place to do it in this meeting if uh { disfmarker } Professor B : Think so ? PhD D : Well , it 's that { disfmarker } It 's just gon na be ver very boring for people who are not you know , sort of really interested in the details of the recognition system . Grad A : I 'm interested . Professor B : Well , OK , so how many { disfmarker } how many people here would not be interested in uh { disfmarker } in a meeting about recognition ? PhD C : Me too . PhD F : Jane may not be . Grad A : Jane , I think . PhD C : Yep . PhD D : Well I know { disfmarker } Well , Jane an Well you mean in a separate meeting or ha ha talking about it in this { disfmarker } Grad A : No . If we talked about it in this meeting . PhD F : He 's wondering how much overlap there will be . Professor B : Yeah , so you 're su PhD D : OK . Professor B : So . PhD D : So , uh , uh , Liz and Jane probably . Professor B : OK , so we 're gon na have a guy 's meeting . PhD D : Uh . { vocalsound } Uh , if you wan na put it that way . PhD F : Good thing Liz is n't here . Professor B : Real { disfmarker } Grad E : Watch a ball game ? Professor B : Yeah , real { disfmarker } real { disfmarker } real men { vocalsound } `` Real men do decoding `` or something like that . PhD F : Do n't listen to this , Liz . PhD D : Right . Professor B : Uh . PhD D : I mean it it 's sort of { disfmarker } I mean when { disfmarker } when the talk is about data collection stuff , sometimes I 've { disfmarker } you know , I { disfmarker } I 'm bored . Professor B : Yeah . Grad A : The { disfmarker } Nod off ? PhD D : So it 's I c I can sympathize with them not wanting to { disfmarker } i to { disfmarker } to be uh { disfmarker } you know { disfmarker } If { disfmarker } I cou you know { disfmarker } this could { disfmarker } Professor B : It 's cuz { pause } y you have a { disfmarker } So you need a better developed feminine side . PhD D : I 'm Professor B : There 's probably gon na be a lot of `` bleeps `` in this meeting . PhD D : not sure I wan na { disfmarker } Grad A : Yeah , I would as { comment } I would guess . Professor B : Uh . Um . PhD D : Yeah and { disfmarker } Professor B : I think it must be { pause } uh nearing the end of the week . Um . { vocalsound } Yeah . I { disfmarker } You know , I { disfmarker } I 've heard some comments about like this . That m could be . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : I mean the { disfmarker } Um . { vocalsound } U PhD D : And we do n't have to do it every week . PhD F : Could we { disfmarker } PhD D : We could do it every other week or so . You know , whatev or whenever we feel like we { disfmarker } PhD F : Right , I was { disfmarker } Why do n't we alternate this meeting every other week ? Grad A : Or just alternate the focus . PhD F : Tha - That 's what I mean . Grad A : Yeah , so on even weeks have { pause } basic { pause } on data . Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : We could do that , yeah . PhD F : Yeah . PhD D : I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } Personally I 'd { disfmarker } I 'm not in favor of more meetings . Um . { vocalsound } Because , uh . Professor B : Right . Grad A : I am . PhD D : You know . Grad A : Oh sor PhD F : But I do I do n't { disfmarker } I mean a lot of times lately it seems like we do n't really have enough for a full meeting on Meeting Recorder . PhD D : Right . Grad A : Well , except that we keep going for our full time . PhD F : So if we did that { disfmarker } PhD C : Yep . PhD F : Well , cuz we get into these other topics . Grad A : Yeah . PhD D : We feel { disfmarker } We feel obligated to collect more data . Grad E : Yeah . Grad A : Ugh . PhD F : Yeah . Grad A : I do n't . PhD F : So if we could alternate the focus of the meeting { disfmarker } Grad A : Let 's read digits and go . Professor B : Why do n't we just start with that . PhD D : ummh . { comment } ummh . { comment } OK . Professor B : And then if we find , you know we 're just not getting enough done , there 's all these topics not coming up , then we can expand into another meeting . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : But I { disfmarker } I think that 's a great idea . Uh . So uh . Um . Let 's chat about it with Liz and Jane { pause } when we get a chance , see what they think and { disfmarker } PhD D : Mm - hmm . PhD F : Yeah that would be good . I mean Andreas and I have various talks in the halls PhD D : Mm - hmm . PhD F : and there 's lots of things , you know , details and stuff that would I think people 'd be interested in and I 'd { disfmarker } you know , where do we go from here kind of things and { disfmarker } So , it would be good . Professor B : Yeah , and you 're { disfmarker } you 're attending { pause } the uh { disfmarker } the front - end meeting as well as the others so you have { disfmarker } you have probably one of the best { disfmarker } you and I , I guess are the main ones who sort of see the bridge between the two . Grad A : Bridge . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : We are doing recognition in both of them . So . PhD F : Mm - hmm . PhD D : Right . Professor B : Uh . Grad A : OK ? PhD D : So um . So { disfmarker } so we could talk a little bit about that now if { disfmarker } if there 's some time . Grad A : No , no that would be for next week . PhD D : Um I jus So the latest result was that um um yot I tested the uh { disfmarker } the sort of final version of the PLP configuration um on development test data for { disfmarker } for this year 's Hub - five test set . 
Query : What did the professor think about scheduling meetings going forward ? PhD C : Me too . PhD F : Jane may not be . Grad A : Jane , I think . PhD C : Yep . PhD D : Well I know { disfmarker } Well , Jane an Well you mean in a separate meeting or ha ha talking about it in this { disfmarker } Grad A : No . If we talked about it in this meeting . PhD F : He 's wondering how much overlap there will be . Professor B : Yeah , so you 're su PhD D : OK . Professor B : So . PhD D : So , uh , uh , Liz and Jane probably . Professor B : OK , so we 're gon na have a guy 's meeting . PhD D : Uh . { vocalsound } Uh , if you wan na put it that way . PhD F : Good thing Liz is n't here . Professor B : Real { disfmarker } Grad E : Watch a ball game ? Professor B : Yeah , real { disfmarker } real { disfmarker } real men { vocalsound } `` Real men do decoding `` or something like that . PhD F : Do n't listen to this , Liz . PhD D : Right . Professor B : Uh . PhD D : I mean it it 's sort of { disfmarker } I mean when { disfmarker } when the talk is about data collection stuff , sometimes I 've { disfmarker } you know , I { disfmarker } I 'm bored .

Query : What was the team joking about when it came to scheduling meetings ? Professor B : OK , so we 're gon na have a guy 's meeting . PhD D : Uh . { vocalsound } Uh , if you wan na put it that way . PhD F : Good thing Liz is n't here . Professor B : Real { disfmarker } Grad E : Watch a ball game ?

Query : What was the general discussion of the meeting ? Grad B :  Grad D : How many batteries do you go through ? Grad B : Thank you . Professor C : Alright . PhD A : Sure . Professor C : Good . Yeah . OK so , let 's get started . Nancy said she 's coming and that means she will be . Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start . So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week and , I think got a lot done . Grad E : Yeah , I think so too . Um . The { disfmarker } we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like `` Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . `` It actually says , `` Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , `` Grad B : OK . Grad E : which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences . Grad B : OK . Grad E : So uh , Professor C : It does n't know `` I `` . Grad B : OK . Grad E : Um , the uh Grad B : Oh , Am Spartacus . `` Grad D : `` I am Sm - I am Smarticus `` is what it 's saying . PhD A : Right . Grad B : Verstehe . OK . Grad D : I gue Grad E : The uh sythesis is just a question of um , hopefully it 's just a question of exchanging a couple of files , once we have them . And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach . So I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm going backwards now , so `` synthesis `` is where you sort of make this { disfmarker } uh , make these sounds , and `` concept to speech `` is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better , presumably . Then , just with text to speech . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad E : And , uh , Johno learned how to write XML tags . Uh , and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some { disfmarker } some sentences . No , right ? Grad D : Yeah . Grad E : Yeah , for a couple { disfmarker } Grad D : So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a { disfmarker } er in XML and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else . And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like { disfmarker } the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog . So , you have a { disfmarker } basically , a goal and it , you know , says `` OK , well I 'm gon na try to do the Greet - the - person goal , Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad D : so it just starts { disfmarker } uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . Basically , it just means `` build the tree . `` Grad B : OK . Grad D : And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module . Grad E : But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the { disfmarker } the syntax trees for three or four . Grad D : We yeah . So , the syntax trees are very simple . It 's like most of the sentences in one tree , Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad D : and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those . And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , tree . Uh , S what do ca structure from the { disfmarker } from the LISP . And so basically you just say , you know , `` noun goes to `` , you know , Er , nah , I do n't re I 've never been good at those . So there 's like the VP goes to N and those things in LISP , and it will generate for you . Grad B : OK . N , N , V yeah , OK . Alright . Grad E : And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module does n't need to be changed . So all that f fancy stuff , and the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gon na be done in October which is much too late for us . So . This way we { disfmarker } we worked around that . The , uh { disfmarker } the system , um { disfmarker } I can show you the system . I actually want , at least , maybe , you should be able to start it on your own . If you wan na play around with it , in th in the future . Right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on { disfmarker } on { disfmarker } on { disfmarker } on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything . And send in a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually works because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where you have the gestural recognition running with this s Siemens virtual touch screen , which we do n't have here . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad E : And so we 're doing it via mouse , but the whole system was designed to work with this thing and it was { disfmarker } It was a lot of engineering stuff . No science in there whatsoever , but it 's working now , and um , that 's the good news . So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation . Grad D : Why { disfmarker } I had { disfmarker } I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones , mainly because you know like uh , the gerund in { disfmarker } in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb , Grad E : You have to switch it on . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad D : so I 'd uh have to add `` am walking , `` Grad B : OK . Grad D : or I 'd have to add a little stem for the `` am `` , when I build the { disfmarker } built the tree . Grad B : OK . Yeah , I noticed that um , that some of the examples they had , had you know , non - English word orders and so on , you know . And then all that good stuff . So . Professor C : Alright . Grad D : Yeah . Grad B : Like . Professor C : So it might be worth , Keith , you looking at this , Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : um Grad B : I { disfmarker } I still do n't { disfmarker } I still do n't really understand e like { disfmarker } Grad D : Well Tilman s Grad B : I mean we sort of say , um { disfmarker } You know , I { disfmarker } I still do n't exactly understand sort of the information flow uh in { disfmarker } in this thing , or what the modules are and so on . So , you know , like just that such - and - such module uh um decides that it wants to achieve the goal of greeting the user , and then magically it sort of s Professor C : Yeah { disfmarker } Grad B : I mean , how does it know which syntactic structure to pull out , and all that ? Professor C : I thi Yeah . So . I think it 's not worth going over in the group , Grad B : R uh Sure . Professor C : but sort of when you get free and you have the time uh either Robert or Johno or I can walk you through it . Grad B : Yeah , soon . OK . Professor C : And you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together . Grad B : That 's fine . Professor C : It 's eee { comment } messy but once you understand it you understand it . It 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } There 's nothing really complicated about it . Grad B : OK . Grad E : No . Grad B : And I remember one thing that { disfmarker } that came up in the talk last Wednesday . Um , was this , I { disfmarker } I think he talked about the idea of like , um { disfmarker } He was talking about these lexicalized uh , uh , tree adjoining grammars where you sort of { disfmarker } for each word you , um { disfmarker } Grad D : OK , you know how to do it ? Grad B : For each lexical item , the lexical entry says what all the uh trees are that it can appear in . And of course , that 's not v That 's the opposite of constructional . That 's , you know , that 's { disfmarker } that 's HPSG or whatever . Professor C : Right . Grad B : You know ? Professor C : Right . Now , we 're { disfmarker } we 're not committed for our research to { pause } do any of those things . Grad B : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Professor C : So uh we are committed for our funding . Grad B : Right . Professor C : OK ? to { pause } uh { disfmarker } Grad B : Make our stuff fit to that . Professor C : Yeah , to { disfmarker } n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need . Grad B : Uh - huh . Professor C : OK ? So between us all we have t to get th the demos they need . If it turns out we can also give them lots more than that by , you know , tapping into other things we do , that 's great . Grad D : You should probably move the microphone closer to your face . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : But i it turns out not to be in an any of the contracts Grad D : There 's like a little { disfmarker } The twisty thing , you can move it with . Grad B : OK . Professor C : and , s deliberately . So , the reason I 'd like you to understand uh what 's going on in this demo system is not because it 's important to the research . It 's just for closure . So that if we come up with a question of `` could we fit this deeper stuff in there ? `` or something . You know what the hell we we 're talking about fitting in . Grad B : Right . OK . Professor C : So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us we just need to really understand what 's there . Is there anything we can make use of ? Uh , is there anything we can give back , beyond th the sort of minimum requirements ? But none of that has a short time fuse . Grad B : OK . Professor C : So th the demo the demo requirements for this Fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something . And then { disfmarker } So , it 's probably fifteen months or something until there 's another serious demo requirement . Grad B : Oh OK . Professor C : That does n't mean we do n't think about it for fifteen months , Grad B : Right . Professor C : but it means we can not think about it for six months . Grad B : Right , yeah . Professor C : So . The plan for this summer uh , really is to step back from the applied project , Grad E : Right . Professor C : keep the d keep the context open , but actually go after the basic issues . Grad B : Hmm . Oh OK . Professor C : And , so The idea is there 's this uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation . But sort of in parallel with that , uh , the hope is tha in particularly you will work on constructions in English Ge - and German for this domain , Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into SmartKom or any of the other { disfmarker } anything lik any other constraints for the time being . Grad B : Yeah . OK . Got it . Professor C : It 's hard enough to get it semantically and syntactically right and then { disfmarker } and get the constructions in their form and stuff . Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : And , I don I do n't want you f feeling that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints . Grad B : Right , OK . Professor C : Um . And similarly with the parsing , uh we 're gon na worry about parsing uh , the general case you know , construction parser for general constructions . And , if we need a cut - down version for something , or whatever , we 'll worry about that later . Grad B : OK . Professor C : So I 'd like to , for the summer turn into science mode . Grad B : OK . Professor C : And I assume that 's also , uh , your plan as well . Grad B : So I mean , the { disfmarker } the point is that like the meetings um so far that I 've been at have been { disfmarker } sort of been geared towards this demo , Professor C : Right . Yeah . Yeah . Grad B : and then that 's going to go away pretty soon . Professor C : But { disfmarker } but we we 're swit Grad B : OK . Professor C : Right . Grad B : And then we 'll sort of shift gears a Fairly substantially , Professor C : Yeah . Grad E : It 's { disfmarker } Professor C : Yeah . Grad B : huh ? Professor C : Yeah . Grad E : It 's got . What I { disfmarker } what I think is { disfmarker } is a good idea that I can { disfmarker } can show to anyone who 's interested , we can even make a { disfmarker } sort of an internal demo , and I { disfmarker } I show you what I do , Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad E : I speak into it and you hear it talk , Grad B : OK . Grad E : and I can sort of walk f through the information . So , this is like in half hour or forty - five minutes . Just fun . Grad B : OK . Grad E : And so you { disfmarker } when somebody on the streets com comes up to you and asks you what is SmartKom so you can , sort of , give a sensible answer . Grad B : Right . OK . Professor C : So , c sh we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing ? Just give a talk in the big room , and { disfmarker } and so peo people know what 's going on ? when you 're ready ? Grad E : Absolutely . Professor C : Yeah I mean , that 's the kind of thing { disfmarker } That 's the level at which you know we can just li invite everybody and say `` this is a project that we 've been working on and here 's a demo version of it `` and stuff like that . Grad B : Yeah . Grad E : OK . Well d we { disfmarker } we do wan na have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra XML messages from left and right before you 're { disfmarker } Grad B : Uh - huh . Professor C : Indeed . Grad E : Yeah . OK . Makes sense . Professor C : But any so that { disfmarker } e e It 's clear , then , I think . Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report . Grad B : Yeah . OK . Professor C : But uh starting next meeting I think we want to flip into this mode where { disfmarker } Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues , what 's the ontology look like , Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : you know what do the constructions look like , what 's the execution engine look like , mmm lots of things . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : But , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out . Now before we do that , let 's get back in { disfmarker } Oh ! But , it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version enough , so that you can { disfmarker } can see what { disfmarker } what it is that { disfmarker } that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something . Grad B : Yeah . OK , right . Professor C : And Johno 's already done that , uh , looked at the dem uh the { disfmarker } looked at the SmartKom stuff . Grad D : Wa uh { disfmarker } To some de uh what { disfmarker } what part of th the SmartKom stuff ? Professor C : Well , the parser , and that stuff . Grad D : Oh yeah { disfmarker } yeah . Professor C : OK . Anyway . So , the trip { disfmarker } the report on these { disfmarker } the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week . Grad B : Yeah . It 's alright . Grad E : Um . { vocalsound } Well it was just amazing to { disfmarker } to see uh how { disfmarker } how instable the whole thing is , Professor C : Maybe you 're done , then . Grad E : and if you just take the { disfmarker } And I g I got the feeling that we are { pause } the only ones right now who have a running system . I do n't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running because e the version { disfmarker } that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work . And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work . And so it 's { disfmarker } And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said `` yeah there never was a really working version that uh did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version `` . So we 're actually maybe ahead of the System Gruppe by now , the system { disfmarker } the integration group . And it was , uh { disfmarker } It was fun to some extent , but the uh the outcome that is sort of of scientific interest is that I think both Ralf and Tilman { disfmarker } um , I know that they enjoyed it here , and they r they { disfmarker } they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here , what { disfmarker } what we have been thinking about , and they 're more than willing to { disfmarker } to um , cooperate , by all means . And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal `` group - ware `` server at EML , make that open to all of us and them , so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and { disfmarker } and generating and constructions w we { disfmarker } we sort of uh put it in there and they put what they do in there and maybe we can even um , get some overlap , get some synergy out of that . And um , the , uh { disfmarker } If I find someone at { disfmarker } in EML that is interested in that , um I { disfmarker } I may even think that we could look { disfmarker } take constructions and { disfmarker } and generate from them because the tree adjoining grammars that { disfmarker } that Tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism . And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees , H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction . So if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and there might be something of interest there , but in the moment we 're of course definitely focused on the understanding , um , pipeline . Professor C : Anyth - any other { vocalsound } { comment } uh repo visit reports sort of stories ? uh we { disfmarker } so we now know I think , what the landscape is like . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : And so we just push on and { disfmarker } and uh , do what we need to do . And one of the things we need to do is the um , and this I think is relatively tight { disfmarker } tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff . So . Uh . And I was going to switch to start talking about that unless there 're m other more general questions . OK so here 's where we are on the belief - net stuff as far as I understand it . Um . Going back I guess two weeks ago uh Robert had laid out this belief - net , missing only the connections . Right ? That is { disfmarker } { comment } So , he 'd put all th all the dots down , and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there . Yeah { comment } we may run across one or two more . But of course the connections were n't . So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff . And so Bhaskara tracked that down . The answer seems to be uh , `` no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do `` . And , so the current state of things is that , again , starting now , um we 'd like to actually get a running belief - net for this particular subdomain done in the next few weeks . So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June , and uh , he 's gon na leave us an inheritance , which is a uh { disfmarker } hopefully a belief - net that does these things . And there 're two aspects to it , one of which is , you know , technical , getting the coding right , and making it run , and uh stuff like that . And the other is the actual semantics . OK ? What all { disfmarker } you know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate . So he doe h he does n't need help from this group on the technical aspects or if he does uh we 'll do that separately . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : But in terms of what are the decisions and stuff like that , that 's something that we all have to work out . Is { disfmarker } is that right ? I mean that 's { disfmarker } that 's both you guys ' understanding of where we are ? Grad E : Absolutely . Professor C : OK . Grad G : So , I guess , um { disfmarker } Is there like a latest version of the belief - net { disfmarker } of the proposed belief - net ? Like { disfmarker } Grad E : We had um decided { disfmarker } Grad G : like { disfmarker } Grad E : Um . Well , no , we did n't decide . We wanted to look into maybe getting it , the visualization , a bit clearer , but I think if we do it , um , sort of a paper version of all the nodes and then the connections between them , that should suffice . Grad G : Mm - hmm . Yeah , that should be fine . Professor C : Yeah I mean , that 's a separate problem . Grad D : Yeah , I { disfmarker } Professor C : We do in the long run wan na do better visualization and all that stuff . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : That 's separable , yeah . Grad D : I did look into that , uh in terms of , you know , exploding the nodes out and down ag Professor C : Yep . Right . Grad D : JavaBayes does not support that . I can imagine a way of hacking at the code to do that . It 'd probably take two weeks or so to actually go through and do it , Professor C : Not { disfmarker } not at this point . Grad D : and I went through all the other packages on Murph - Kevin Murphy 's page , Professor C : Right . Grad D : and I could n't find the necessary mix of free and uh with the GUI and , with this thing that we want . Professor C : Well , we can p If it 's { disfmarker } If we can pay { disfmarker } Yeah . If you know it 's paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that . OK ? So { disfmarker } so do n't view free as { disfmarker } as a absolute constraint . Grad D : OK . OK , so then I 'll go back and look at the ones on the list that { disfmarker } Professor C : OK . And you can ask Kevin . Grad E : But { disfmarker } Grad G : Yeah . Grad D : Mmm . Grad E : But { disfmarker } Grad G : Yeah , the one that uh people seem to use is uh Hugin or whatever ? Professor C : Hugin , yeah that 's free . Grad G : How exp I do n't think it 's { disfmarker } Is it free ? Because I 've seen it advertised in places so I { disfmarker } it seems to { disfmarker } Professor C : Uh , it may be free to academics . Like I { disfmarker } I do n't know . I have a co { comment } I have a copy { comment } that I l I downloaded . Grad G : OK . Professor C : So , at one point it was free . Grad G : OK . Professor C : Uh but yo I noticed people do use Hugin so um , Grad D : How do you spell that ? Professor C : HUGIN . Grad F : Why Professor C : And Bhaskara can give you a pointer . So then , in any case , um { disfmarker } But paying a lit You know , if i if it 's uh { disfmarker } Probably for university , it 's { disfmarker } it 's gon na be real cheap anyway . But um , you know , if it 's fifty thousand dollars we are n't gon na do it . I 'm mean , we have no need for that . Grad E : I { disfmarker } I also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } in changing the { disfmarker } the JavaBayes code . Professor C : No , Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : he 's not gon na do that . Grad D : OK . Grad E : I { disfmarker } I will send you a pointer to a Java applet that does that , it 's sort of a fish - eye . You { disfmarker } you have a node , and you click on it , and it shows you all the connections , Grad D : Mmm . Grad E : and then if you click on something else that moves away , that goes into the middle . And maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two . If that does n't work , it 's not a problem we { disfmarker } we need to solve right now . What I 'm { disfmarker } what my job is , I will , um , give you the input in terms of { disfmarker } of the internal structure . Maybe node by node , or something like this ? Or should I collect it all Grad G : Mm - hmm . Grad E : and { disfmarker } Professor C : Does n't matter . Grad G : Um , just any like { disfmarker } like sort of rough representation of the entire belief - net is probably best . Grad E : OK . And um you 're gon na be around ? t again , always Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoon - ish ? As usual ? Or will that change ? Grad G : Yeah { disfmarker } I mean , yeah , I can { disfmarker } like I c Um . This week I guess um , kind of { disfmarker } I have a lot of projects and stuff but after that I will generally be more free . So yes , I might { disfmarker } I can be around . And g I mean , generally if you email me also I can be around on other days . Grad E : Yeah . OK . Professor C : Yeah and this is not a crisis that { disfmarker } I mean , you do , e everybody who 's a student should , you know do their work , get their c courses all in good shape and { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and then we 'll dig { disfmarker } d dig down on this . Grad E : Yeah , that 's { disfmarker } Yeah . OK . No , that 's good . That means I have I h I can spend this week doing it . So . Grad G : OK . Grad B : How do you go about this process of deciding what these connections are ? I know that there 's an issue of how to weight the different things too , and stuff . Right ? I mean do you just sort of guess and see if it sort of { disfmarker } Professor C : Right . Well there { disfmarker } there { disfmarker } there There 're two different things you do . Grad E : It 's { disfmarker } Professor C : One is you design and the other is you learn . OK ? So uh what we 're gon na do initially is { disfmarker } is do design , and , i if you will , guess . Grad B : OK . Professor C : OK . Uh that is you know use your best knowledge of { disfmarker } of the domain to uh , hypothesize what the dependencies are and stuff . Grad B : Right . OK . Professor C : If it 's done right , and if you have data then , there are techniques for learning the numbers given the structure Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : and there are even techniques for learning the structure , although that takes a lot more data , and it 's not as @ @ and so forth and so on . So uh but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise I think we 'll just design it . Grad B : Alright . Grad E : Yeah . Fo - Hopefully as time passes we 'll get more and more data from Heidelberg and from people actually using it and stuff . Grad B : OK . Grad E : So but this is the { pause } { vocalsound } { comment } { pause } long run . Grad B : Yeah . Grad E : But to solve our problems ag uh a mediocre design will do I think in the beginning . Grad B : Yeah , that 's right . Yeah , oh , and by the way , speaking of data , um , are there I could swore { disfmarker } uh , I could swear I saw it sitting on someone 's desk at some point , but is there a { disfmarker } um a transcript of any of the , sort of , initial interactions of people with the { disfmarker } with the system ? Cuz you know , I 'm still sort of itching to { disfmarker } to look at what { disfmarker } look at the stuff , and see what people are saying . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah make yourself a note . So and { disfmarker } and , of course Keith would like the German as well as the English , so whatever you guys can get . Grad E : The German . Oh yeah , of course , German . Yeah . Professor C : Yeah , the y your native language , right ? You remember that one . Grad E : OK . That 's important , yeah . Grad B : Yeah , Professor C : So he 'll get you some data . Grad B : u OK . Yeah , I mean I { disfmarker } I sort of um found the uh , uh the audio of some of those , and um , it kind of sounded like I did n't want to trudge through that , you know . Grad E : Hmm . Grad B : It was just { disfmarker } Strange , but . Professor C : Yep . Grad E : We probably will not get those to describe because they were trial runs . Grad B : Oh yeah , OK . Grad E : Um , but uh that 's th but we have data in English and German already . Grad B : OK , yeah , I mean . Grad E : So . { disfmarker } Transcribed . I will send you that . OK . Professor C : OK , so while we 're still at this sort of top level , anything else that we oughta talk about today ? Grad E : Ho - how was your thingy . Grad B : Oh , um , I just wanted to , uh , s like mention as an issue , um , you know last meeting I was n't here because I went to a linguistics colloquium on the fictive motion stuff , Professor C : Oh right . Grad B : and that was pretty interesting and you know , I mean , seems to me that that will fairly obviously be of relevance to uh { disfmarker } to what we 're doing here because you know people are likely to give descriptions like you know , `` What 's that thing uh right where you start to go up the hill , `` or something like that , you know , meaning a few feet up the hill or whatever from some reference point and all that stuff so I mean , I 'm sure in terms of you know , people trying to state locations or , you know , all that kind of stuff , this is gon na be very relevant . So , um , now that was { disfmarker } the talk was about English versus Japanese , um , which obviously the Japanese does n't affect us directly , except that , um , some of the construction { disfmarker } he 'd { disfmarker } what he talked about was that you know in English we say things like th you know , `` your bike is parked across the street `` and we use these prepositional phrases , you know , `` well , if you were to move across the street you would be at the bike `` , but um in { disfmarker } in Japanese the { disfmarker } the more conventionalized tendency is to use a { disfmarker } sort of a description of `` where one has crossed to the river , there is a tree `` . Um , and you know , you can actually say things like , um , `` there 's a tree where one has crossed the river , but no one has ever crossed the river `` , or something like that . So the idea is that this really is you know that 's supposed show that 's it 's really fictive and so on . But um { disfmarker } But the point is that that kind of construction is also used in English , you know , like `` right where you start to go up the hill `` , or `` just when you get off the train `` , or something like that to { disfmarker } uh , to indicate where something is . Professor C : Mmm . Grad B : So we 'll have to think about { disfmarker } Professor C : So { disfmarker } how much is that used in German ? Grad E : Um . The uh { disfmarker } Well { disfmarker } I wa I was on a uh { disfmarker } on a { disfmarker } on a different sidetrack . Professor C : Oh , OK . Grad E : I mean , the { disfmarker } the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at { disfmarker } at the moment , but this is a { disfmarker } a three language project : German , English , Japanese . Grad B : OK . Grad E : And um , we have a uh , uh { disfmarker } I have taken care that we have the { disfmarker } the Japanese generation and stuff . And so I looked into uh spatial description . So we can generate spatial descriptions , how to get from A to B . And { disfmarker } and information on objects , in German , English , and Japanese . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad E : And there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh { disfmarker } differences in spatial descriptions . Well , if yo if you 're interested in that , so how { disfmarker } how , I mean it does sort of go d all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent . Grad B : OK . Grad E : So . Um . Professor C : So , where is this huge project ? Grad E : It 's KLEIST . It 's the uh Bielefeld generation of uh spatial descriptions and whatever . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad E :  Professor C : Well , that may be another thing that Keith wants to look at . Grad B : OK . Grad E : But um , I { disfmarker } I think we should leave Japanese constructions maybe outside of the scope for { disfmarker } for now , Grad B : Yeah . Grad E : but um definitely it 's interesting to look at { disfmarker } at cross the bordered there . Professor C : Mm - hmm . PhD A : Are { disfmarker } are you going to p pay any attention to the relative position { disfmarker } of { disfmarker } of the direction relative { disfmarker } relative to the speaker ? For example , there are some differences between Hebrew and English . We can say um `` park in front of the car `` as you come beh you drive behind the car . In Hebrew it means `` park behind the car `` , because to follow the car is defined as it faces you . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Intrinsic , yeah . PhD A : While in English , front of the car is the absolute front of the car . Grad B : OK . PhD A : So . Grad B : Right , so the canonical direction of motion determines where the front is . PhD A : Right . Right . Grad B : OK . PhD A : So , i i i is German uh closer to { disfmarker } to E uh , uh , uh , uh { disfmarker } to E I mean uh Grad E : Mm - hmm . PhD A : I do n't think it { disfmarker } it 's related to syntax , though , so it may be entirely different . Grad E : Um , as a matter of fact { disfmarker } Professor C : No , it 's not . Grad B : Right . PhD A : Yeah . Grad E : Um . Did you ever get to look at the { disfmarker } the rou paper that I sent you on the { disfmarker } on that problem in English and German ? Grad B : I think { disfmarker } Grad E : Carroll , ninety - three . Um . I { disfmarker } There is a { disfmarker } a study on the differences between English and German on exactly that problem . PhD A : Hmm . Grad E : So it 's { disfmarker } they actually say `` the monkey in front of the car , where 's the monkey ? `` Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad E : And , um , they found statistically very significant differences in English and German , so I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } It might be , since there are only a finite number of ways of doing it , that { disfmarker } that German might be more like Hebrew in that respect . Grad B : Hmm . Grad E : The solution they proposed was that it was due to syntactic factors . PhD A : That { disfmarker } but it was n't { disfmarker } was { disfmarker } Grad E : That syntactic facto factors do { disfmarker } do play a role there , wh whether you 're more likely , you know , to develop uh , choices that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frames . PhD A : Right . Mm - hmm . Right . Grad B : I mean , it seems to me that you can get both in { disfmarker } in English depending o Professor C : Hmm . Grad B : You know , like , `` in front of the car `` could you know { disfmarker } Like , here 's the car sideways to me in between me and the car or something 's in front of the car , or whatever . I could see that , Professor C : Absolutely . Grad B : but { disfmarker } But anyway , so you know , I mean , this was { disfmarker } this was a { disfmarker } a very good talk on those kinds of issues and so on . So uh . Grad E : I can also give you uh , a pointer to a paper of mine which is the { disfmarker } the ultimate taxonomy of reference frames . Grad B : Alright ! Cool ! Grad E : So . Professor C : Oh . Grad E : I 'm the only person in the world who actually knows how it works . Professor C : Oh . Grad E : Not really . Professor C : Great . No , I 've not seen that . PhD A : What do you mean . Um . `` reference frames `` ? Grad E : It 's called a { disfmarker } PhD A : uh uh Grad E : It 's { disfmarker } it 's spatial reference frames . You actually have only { disfmarker } Um . If you wan na have a { disfmarker } This is usually um { disfmarker } I should { disfmarker } there should be an `` L `` , though . Well actually you have { disfmarker } only have two choices . You can either do a two - point or a three - point which is you You 're familiar with th with the `` origo `` ? where that 's the center { disfmarker } `` Origo `` is the center of the f frame of reference . Grad B : Hmm . Grad E : And then you have the reference object and the object to be localized . Grad B : Hmm . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Grad E : OK ? In some cases the origo is the same as the reference object . Professor C : So that would be `` origin `` in English , Grad F : This was like { disfmarker } Grad B : The origin . PhD A : Right Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : right ? Grad E : `` Origo `` is a Terminus technikus . in that sense , that 's even used in the English literature . `` Origo . `` Grad B : Oh , OK . I never heard it . Professor C : Alright . PhD A : OK . Grad B : OK . Grad E : And um , so , this video tape is in front of me . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad E : I 'm the origo and I 'm also the reference object . Grad B : Mm - hmm . PhD A : Right . Grad E : Those are two - point . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad E : And three - point relations is if something has an intrinsic front side like this chair then your f shoe is behind the chair . Professor C : Yeah . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad E : And , reference object and { disfmarker } Um . No , from { disfmarker } from my point of view your shoe is left of the chair . Grad B : Right . You { disfmarker } you can actually say things like , um , `` it 's behind the tree from me `` or something like that , I think , in { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } in certain circumstances in English , right ? As sort of `` from where I 'm standing it would appear that `` { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah . Yeah . So , Grad F : Looks a little bit like Reichenbach for time . Professor C : Yeah , it sounds like it , does n't it , Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : yeah . Grad F : It 's a lot like it . Grad E : And then { disfmarker } and then here you { disfmarker } Grad F : Um . Grad E : On this scale , you have it either be ego or allocentric . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad E : And that 's { comment } { disfmarker } that 's basically it . So . Egocentric two - point , egocentric three - point , or you can have allocentric . Grad B : Oh , OK . Grad E : So , `` as seen from the church , the town hall is right of that um , fire station `` . aa - huh { comment } It 's hardly ever used but it 's w PhD A : I 'd love to see it if you { disfmarker } if you have a copy kind of . Uh . Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : Yeah . I see this is { disfmarker } this is getting into Ami 's thing . PhD A : Here Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : He 's { disfmarker } he 's very interested in that . Grad E : OK . Professor C : So . Grad B : Me too . Professor C : Uh . Yeah . Well , why do n't you just put it on the web page ? There 's this EDU { disfmarker } Right ? Grad E : Yeah it 's { disfmarker } or { disfmarker } or just { disfmarker } Yeah . Professor C : Or a link to it . Grad E : It 's also all on my { disfmarker } my home page at EML . It 's called `` An Anatomy of a Spatial Description `` . Professor C : Just Grad E : But I 'll send that link . PhD A : OK , great . Professor C : Maybe just put a link on . Yeah . Grad E : Yep . Professor C : By the way , there { disfmarker } something that I did n't know until about a week ago or so , is apparently , there are separate brain areas for things within reach , and things that are out of reach . Grad E : Yep . Grad B : Huh . Professor C : So there 's { disfmarker } there 's uh all this linguistic stuff about you know , near and far , or yon and { disfmarker } and so forth . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : So this is all { disfmarker } This is { disfmarker } There 's this linguistic facts . But apparently , the { disfmarker } Uh . Here 's the way the findings go . That , you know they do MRI , and { disfmarker } and if you 're uh { disfmarker } got something within reach then there 's one of your areas lights up , and if something 's out of reach uh a different one . But here 's the { disfmarker } the amazing result , um , they say . You get someone with a { disfmarker } with a deficit so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things . So the s typical task is subdivision . So there 's a { disfmarker } a line on the wall over there , and you give them a laser pointer , and you say , `` Where 's the midpoint ? `` And they do fine . If you give them the line , and they have to touch it , they ca n't . There 's just that part of the brain is n't functioning , so they ca n't do that . Here 's the real experiment . The same thing on the wall , you give them a laser , `` where is it ? `` , Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : they do it . Give them a stick , long stick , and say `` do it `` , they ca n't do it . So there 's a remapping of distant space into nearby space . PhD A : Right . So they doubled { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the end { disfmarker } the end of this { disfmarker } Grad F : Because it 's within reach now ? Grad B : Yeah , Professor C : It 's not within reach and you use the Within - Reach uh , mechanism . Grad B : yeah . Grad F : Oh . Wow . Grad B : Circuits . PhD A : Right . Professor C : So I 'll d I 'll dig you up this reference . Grad B : That 's cool . Professor C : And so this doe This is , uh { disfmarker } First of all , it explains something that I 've always wondered about and I 'll do this { disfmarker } this test on you guys as well . So . Uh . How - I have had an experience , not often , but a certain number of times , when , for example , I 'm working with a tool , a screwdriver or something , for a long time , I start feeling the tip directly . Not indirectly , but you actually can feel the tip . Grad B : Yeah yeah . Professor C : And people who are uh accomplished violinists and stuff like that , claim they also have this kind of thing where you get a direct sensation of , physical sensation , of the end affector . Grad B : Yeah . What 's going on at the end of the tool , PhD A : The ext the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } The extension , Grad B : yeah . Professor C : Huh ? Grad B : What 's going on at the end of the tool , or whatever . Professor C : Yeah , within { disfmarker } PhD A : right . Professor C : Huh ? PhD A : The extension of { disfmarker } of your hand , right . Professor C : Yeah , right . Have you hav y h had this ? PhD A : The { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I think so . I mean i i it 's not exactly the th same thing , but { disfmarker } but s it { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } it 's getting close to that . Grad B : Yeah . Grad F : W what does it feel like ? Professor C : Oh i it feels like your { disfmarker } as if your uh neurons had extended themselves out to this tool , and you 're feeling forces on it and so forth and { disfmarker } and you deal directly with it . PhD A : I once { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I was playing you know with those um uh devices that allow you to manipulate objects when it 's dangerous to get close ? So you can insert your hand something Grad B : Oh , OK . Professor C : Right , yeah { disfmarker } yeah { disfmarker } yeah . Yeah . PhD A : and there 's a correspondence between { disfmarker } Professor C : Yeah . PhD A : So I played with it . After a while , you do n't feel the difference anymore . I { disfmarker } I mean it 's kind of { disfmarker } Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Yeah , right . PhD A : Very { disfmarker } kind of { disfmarker } you stop back and suddenly it goes away and you have to kind of work again to recapture it , but yeah . Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : Right , Yeah , so anyway , so { disfmarker } So this was the first actual experimental evidence I 'd seen that was consistent with this anecdotal stuff . Grad B : That 's cool . Professor C : And of course it makes a lovely def uh story about why languages uh , make this distinction . Of course there are behavioral differences too . Things you can reach are really quite different than things you ca n't . Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : But there seems to be an actu really deep embodied neural difference . And i this is , um { disfmarker } So . In addition to the e Grad E : This is more proximal - distal . Professor C : Yeah uh exactly . So in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded . S Grad E : Well , Dan Montello sort of , he { disfmarker } he does the uh uh { disfmarker } th the cognitive map world , down in Santa Barbara . And he { disfmarker } he always talks about these { disfmarker } He { disfmarker } he already { disfmarker } well { disfmarker } i probably most likely without knowing this { disfmarker } this evidence uh is talking about these small scale spaces that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental spaces . Professor C : Yeah . Well there 's { disfmarker } there 's uh been a lot of behavioral things o on this , but that was the first neur neuro - physiological thing I saw . Anyway yeah , so we 'll { disfmarker } we 'll look at this . And . So , all of these issues now { disfmarker } are now starting to come up . So , now { disfmarker } we 're now done with demos . We 're starting to do science , right ? And so these issues about uh , reference , and { disfmarker } spatial { comment } reference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uh { comment } all this sort of stuff , uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about , Grad B : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor C : um { disfmarker } So , all of this stuff is coming up essentially starting now . So we got ta do all this . So there 's that . And then there 's also a set of system things that come up . So `` OK , we 're not using their system . That means we need our system . `` Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Right ? Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : It { disfmarker } it follows . And so , uh , in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right , and the formalism and stuff , we 're actually gon na build something and uh , Johno is point person on the parser , analyzer , whatever that is , and we 're gon na start on that in parallel with the um , the grammar stuff . Grad B : Alright . Professor C : But to do that we 're gon na need to make some decisions like ontology , so , um { disfmarker } And so this is another thing where we 're gon na , you know , have to get involved and make s relatively early I think , make some decisions on uh , `` is there an ontology API that { disfmarker } that `` { disfmarker } There 's a sort of standard way of getting things from ontologies and we build the parser and stuff around that , or is there a particular ontology that we 're gon na standardize on , and if so { disfmarker } For example , is there something that we can use there . i Does uh either the uh SmartKom project or one of the projects at EML have something that we can just p pull out , for that . Uh , so there are gon na be some { disfmarker } some { disfmarker } some things like that , which are not science but system . But we are n't gon na ignore those cuz we 're { disfmarker } we 're not only going { disfmarker } The plan is not only to lay out this thing , but to actually uh build some of it . And how much we build , and { disfmarker } and so forth . Grad B : I { disfmarker } Professor C : Uh . Part of it , if it works right , is wh It looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that Nancy needs for the child language modeling . So . It 's always been out of phase but it now seems that um , there 's a good shot at that . So we 've talked about it , and the hope is that we can make these things the same thing , Grad B : OK . Professor C : and of course it 's only w In both cases it 's only one piece of a bigger system . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : But it would be nice if that piece were exactly the same piece . Grad B : Right . Professor C : It was just this uh construction analyzer . And so we think { disfmarker } we think we have a shot at { disfmarker } at that . Grad B : OK . Professor C : So . The for So . To { disfmarker } to come full circle on that , this formalization task , OK ? is trying to get the formalism into { disfmarker } into a shape where it can actually uh Grad B : Yeah . Be of use to someone who 's trying to do this , right ? Professor C : d Well , yeah , where it actually is { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } covers the whole range of things . And the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the thing that got Mark into the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do , and he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanisms . It turned out , inherently not to cover the space . Grad B : OK . Professor C : And it just { disfmarker } it was just terribly frustrating for him , Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : and he seemed fully committed to both sides of this i i irreconcilable thing . Grad B : I see . Right . Professor C : And . Uh . Johno is much more pragmatic . Grad B : OK . Good to know . Professor C : Uh . Huh ? Is { disfmarker } This is true , is it not ? Grad D : Yes . Professor C : OK . So there 's you know sort of , yeah , deep , really deep , emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh , complete . Grad B : Oh , OK . Grad F : You do n't have a hidden purist streak ? Grad D : Oh no . Professor C : We - well it has n't it { disfmarker } it certainly has n't been observed , in any case . Grad F : OK . Just checking . Grad D : No sir . Grad B : Alright . Professor C : Um . Now , you do , but that 's OK . Uh . So . For { disfmarker } for { disfmarker } Grad B : Cuz I do n't have to implement anything . Professor C : Exactly right . Exactly . Grad F : I have a problem , then . It 's { disfmarker } So . Whether I do depends on whether I 'm talking to him or him probably . PhD A : Hmm . Grad B : Yeah , right . Professor C : Right . Why { disfmarker } a actually , uh , the thing is , you { disfmarker } you do but , th the thing you have to im implement is so small that { disfmarker } Uh . Grad F : Which meeting I 'm in . It 's OK to be purist within that context . Professor C : Within that , yeah , Grad F : Yes , Professor C : and uh , it 's { disfmarker } a and still , I think , you know , get something done . Grad F : good . Grad B : Cool ! Professor C : But to try to do something upscale and purist Particularly if { disfmarker } if um what you 're purist about does n't actually work , { vocalsound } is real hard . Grad F : Yay . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Yeah . Professor C : OK . And then the other thing is while we 're doing this uh Robert 's gon na pick a piece of this space , PhD A : It 's possible yeah . Grad B : OK . Professor C : OK , uh , for his absentee thesis . I think you all know that { disfmarker } that you can just , in Germany { disfmarker } almost just send in your thesis . Grad B : Just a drive up . Ca - chuk ! PhD A : Um Professor C : Yeah right . Grad B : There you go . Professor C : OK . Grad E : The - th There { disfmarker } there 's a drive - in thesis uh sh { vocalsound } joint over in Saarbruecken . Grad B : Exactly . Drive through , yeah . Professor C : It costs a lot . The { disfmarker } the amount { disfmarker } You put in your credit card and { disfmarker } { vocalsound } as well . But , uh , { disfmarker } But anyway , so , uh , that 's um , also got ta be worked out , hopefully over the next few weeks , so that { disfmarker } that it becomes clear uh , what piece uh , Robert wants to jump into . And , while we 're at this level , uh , there 's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either next week or the first of August , depending on the blandishments of Microsoft . Grad B : OK . Professor C : So , de Uh . And her name is Eva . Grad B : OK . Professor C : It really is . Nobody believed th th that { disfmarker } Grad F : Yeah , I thought it had to be a joke , of your part , you know Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : like { disfmarker } { comment } `` Johno made it up , I 'm sure . `` Grad G : Is this person someone who 's in first - year this year , Professor C : No , first year coming . Grad G : or Professor C : So , she 's { disfmarker } she 's now out here she 's moved , and she 'll be a student as of then . Grad G : OK . Professor C : And probably she 'll pick up from you on the belief - net stuff , so sh she 'll be chasing you down and stuff like that . Grad G : OK . Professor C : Uh . Grad E : Document . Grad G : Right . Professor C : Uh , against all traditions . And actually I talked today to a uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this . Uh { disfmarker } Grad F : Someone from the class ? Professor C : No , interestingly enough . Grad F : We always get these people who are not in the class , who { disfmarker } Professor C : Some of th some of them , yeah . Grad F : It 's interesting . Professor C : So anyway , uh , but uh she 's another one of these ones with a three point nine average and so forth and so on . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Uh , so , um , I 've give I 've given her some things to read . So we 'll see how this goes . Oh there 's yet another one of the incoming first { disfmarker } { comment } incoming first - year graduate students who 's expressed interest , so we 'll see how that goes . Um , anyway , so , I think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts . We 'll see whether it 's gon na make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not , I 'm not sure . It partly depends on w what your thesis turns out to be and how that goes . S so , we 'll see . And then , Ami , you can decide , you know , how much time you wan na put into it and uh , it it 's beginning to take shap shape , PhD A : OK . Professor C : so uh and , PhD A : Right Professor C : I think you will find that if you want to look technically at some of the { disfmarker } your traditional questions in this light , uh Keith , who 's buil building constructions , will be quite happy to uh see what , you know , you envision as the issues and the problems and um , how they might uh get reflected in constructions . Grad B : Sure . Professor C : I suspect that 's right . Grad B : Yeah . Yeah . PhD A : I { disfmarker } I may have to go to Switzerland for { disfmarker } in June or beginning of July for between two weeks and four weeks , but uh , after that or before that . Professor C : OK , fine . And , um , if it 's useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at Heidelberg or at the German AI center , while you 're in { disfmarker } in the neighborhood . PhD A : Right . Yeah be uh actu actually I 'm invited to do some consulting with a bank in Geneva which has an affiliation with a research institute in Geneva , which I forgot the name of . Professor C : Yeah . Yep . E o do y PhD A : Yeah . Professor C : Well , we we 're connected to uh { disfmarker } There 's a { disfmarker } there 's a { disfmarker } a very significant connection between { disfmarker } We 'll { disfmarker } we 'll go through this , PhD A : Yeah . Professor C : ICSI and EPFL , which is the , uh { disfmarker } It 's the { disfmarker } Fr Ge - Germany 's got two big technical institutes . There 's one in { disfmarker } in Zurich , PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor C : E T and then there 's one , the French speaking one , in Lausanne , Grad B : Oh , so in Switzerland . Professor C : OK ? which is uh E P PhD A : Great . Professor C : F L . So find out who they are associated with in Geneva . PhD A : Right . Professor C : Probably we 're connected to them . PhD A : Great . I 'll let you know . S I 'll send you email . Professor C : OK . Yeah , and so anyway we c uh { disfmarker } We can m undoubtedly get Ami uh to give a talk at uh EML or something like that . While he 's in { disfmarker } in uh { disfmarker } Grad E : Hmm . Uh . I { disfmarker } I think the one you { disfmarker } you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there , too . PhD A : Sure , yeah . Professor C : A lot of interest . Actually , either place , DFKI or uh { disfmarker } Yeah , so , and { disfmarker } and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it . PhD A : Yeah . Right . Professor C : And you 'll get feedback from these guys . PhD A : Great , yeah . Professor C : Cuz they 've actually { disfmarker } these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone over the last decade in trying to build them . So we 'll set that up . PhD A : Cool . Professor C : OK . So , uh , unless we wan na start digging into the { disfmarker } uh the belief - net and the decisions now , which would be fine , it 's probably { disfmarker } Grad E : I { disfmarker } I tho It 's probably better if I come next week with the um version O point nine of the structure . Professor C : OK . So , how about if you two guys between now and next week come up with something that is partially proposal , and partially questions , saying `` here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we do n't understand `` . And that we as a group will try to { disfmarker } to finish it . What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday . Grad G : Sure . Professor C : OK ? Uh , `` these are the decisions `` { disfmarker } I do n't think we 're gon na get lots more information . It 's a design problem . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : You know . We { disfmarker } Grad G : Yeah . Professor C : Yeah . And let 's come up with a first cut at what this should look like . And then finish it up . Grad B : OK . Professor C : Does that so make sense ? Grad B : OK . Grad E : And um , the { disfmarker } the sem semester will be over next week but then you have projects for one more week to come ? Grad G : No , I { disfmarker } I think I 'll be done { disfmarker } everything by this uh { disfmarker } by the end of this week . Grad E : Same with you ? No . Grad D : Nnn . This { disfmarker } Well , I 've { disfmarker } I have projects , but then the { disfmarker } my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final that he 's giving us . And he 's giving us five days to do it which means it going to be hard . Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : Yeah . Oh . is it a take - home final ? Who 's doing this ? Grad D : Yeah . Aikin , Alex , yeah . Professor C : Yeah , figured . That would have been i my guess . Grad G : Hmm . Professor C : Right . Um , But anyway , yeah . Grad B : Pretty soon . Grad E : OK . Professor C : OK , so I guess that 's Grad D : So , the seventeenth will definitely be the last day , like it or not for me . Professor C : Right . right . So let 's do this , and then we we well there 's gon na be some separate co these guys are talking , uh we have a group on the formalization , uh Nancy and Johno and I are gon na talk about parsers . So there 're various kinds of uh { disfmarker } Grad B : OK . Professor C : Of course , nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people , Grad B : Right . Professor C : right ? So , um , two or three people is the size in which actual work gets done . Grad E : Mmm . Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : So we 'll do that . Great . Oh , the other thing we wan na do is catch up with uh , Ellen and see what she 's doing because the um image schemas are going to be um , an important pa Grad B : Yeah . Quite relevant , yeah . Professor C : We { disfmarker } we want those , Grad B : Yeah , oh yeah . Professor C : right ? And we want them formalized and stuff like that . Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : So let me { disfmarker } let me make a note to do that . Grad B : OK . Yeah , I 'm actually probably going to be in contact with her uh pretty soon anyway because of various of us students were going to have a reading group about precisely that sort of thing over the summer , Grad D : OK . Professor C : Oh right ! Right right right ! Grad B : so . Professor C : That 's great ! Yeah , I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } Shweta mentioned that , although she said it 's a secret . Grad B : OK . Grad D : Hi Grad B : Right , no faculty ! Professor C : Th - the faculty are n't { disfmarker } faculty are n't supposed to know . Grad D : Wednesday 's much better for me , yeah . Professor C : But um , I 'm sufficiently clueless that I count as a { disfmarker } Grad B : Yeah , right . It 's as if we did n't tell anyone at all , Grad D : Bhaskara . Grad B : right . 
Query : What was the general discussion of the meeting ? Professor C : Good . Yeah . OK so , let 's get started . Nancy said she 's coming and that means she will be . Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start . So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week and , I think got a lot done . Grad E : Yeah , I think so too . Um . The { disfmarker } we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like `` Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . `` It actually says , `` Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , `` Grad B : OK . Grad E : which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences . Grad B : OK . Grad E : So uh , Professor C : It does n't know `` I `` . Grad B : OK . Grad E : Um , the uh Grad B : Oh , Am Spartacus . `` Grad D : `` I am Sm - I am Smarticus `` is what it 's saying . PhD A : Right . Grad B : Verstehe . OK . Grad D : I gue Grad E : The uh sythesis is just a question of um , hopefully it 's just a question of exchanging a couple of files , once we have them . And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach . So I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm going backwards now , so `` synthesis `` is where you sort of make this { disfmarker } uh , make these sounds , and `` concept to speech `` is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure so it can pronounce things better , presumably . Then , just with text to speech . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad E : And , uh , Johno learned how to write XML tags . Uh , and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some { disfmarker } some sentences . No , right ? Grad D : Yeah . Grad E : Yeah , for a couple { disfmarker } Grad D : So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a { disfmarker } er in XML and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else . And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like { disfmarker } the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form . And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog . So , you have a { disfmarker } basically , a goal and it , you know , says `` OK , well I 'm gon na try to do the Greet - the - person goal , Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad D : so it just starts { disfmarker } uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold . Basically , it just means `` build the tree . `` Grad B : OK . 
Query : What were the problems encountered with SmartKom system ? Professor C : Good . Yeah . OK so , let 's get started . Nancy said she 's coming and that means she will be . Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start . So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week and , I think got a lot done . Grad E : Yeah , I think so too . Um . The { disfmarker } we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like `` Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . `` It actually says , `` Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , `` Grad B : OK . Grad E : which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences . Grad B : OK . Grad E : So uh , Professor C : It does n't know `` I `` . Grad B : OK . Grad E : Um , the uh Grad B : Oh , Am Spartacus . `` 
Query : What demos would the system be involved in ? Professor C : Yeah I mean , that 's the kind of thing { disfmarker } That 's the level at which you know we can just li invite everybody and say `` this is a project that we 've been working on and here 's a demo version of it `` and stuff like that . Grad B : Yeah . Grad E : OK . Well d we { disfmarker } we do wan na have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra XML messages from left and right before you 're { disfmarker } Grad B : Uh - huh . Professor C : Indeed . Grad E : Yeah . OK . Makes sense . Professor C : But any so that { disfmarker } e e It 's clear , then , I think . Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report . Grad B : Yeah . OK . Professor C : But uh starting next meeting I think we want to flip into this mode where { disfmarker } Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues , what 's the ontology look like , Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : you know what do the constructions look like , what 's the execution engine look like , mmm lots of things . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : But , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out . Now before we do that , let 's get back in { disfmarker } Oh ! But , it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version enough , so that you can { disfmarker } can see what { disfmarker } what it is that { disfmarker } that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something . Grad B : Yeah . OK , right . 
Query : What would happen after the demo ? Grad B : Yeah . Grad E : OK . Well d we { disfmarker } we do wan na have all the bugs out b where you have to sort of pipe in extra XML messages from left and right before you 're { disfmarker } Grad B : Uh - huh . Professor C : Indeed . Grad E : Yeah . OK . Makes sense . Professor C : But any so that { disfmarker } e e It 's clear , then , I think . Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report . Grad B : Yeah . OK . Professor C : But uh starting next meeting I think we want to flip into this mode where { disfmarker } Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues , what 's the ontology look like , Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : you know what do the constructions look like , what 's the execution engine look like , mmm lots of things . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : But , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out . Now before we do that , let 's get back in { disfmarker } Oh ! But , it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version enough , so that you can { disfmarker } can see what { disfmarker } what it is that { disfmarker } that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something . Grad B : Yeah . OK , right . Professor C : And Johno 's already done that , uh , looked at the dem uh the { disfmarker } looked at the SmartKom stuff . Grad D : Wa uh { disfmarker } To some de uh what { disfmarker } what part of th the SmartKom stuff ? Professor C : Well , the parser , and that stuff . Grad D : Oh yeah { disfmarker } yeah . Professor C : OK . Anyway . So , the trip { disfmarker } the report on these { disfmarker } the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week . Grad B : Yeah . It 's alright . Grad E : Um . { vocalsound } Well it was just amazing to { disfmarker } to see uh how { disfmarker } how instable the whole thing is , 
Query : Summarize the meeting Professor A : Am I on ? I guess so . Radio two . Hmm . Radio two . Grad E : Hello ? Professor A : Wow . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Hi ? PhD B : Blow into it , it works really well . Grad F : Channel B . Professor A : People say the strangest things when their microphones are on . PhD D : Channel four . Test . PhD C : Uh - oh . PhD D : OK . PhD C : Radio four . Grad E : Hello ? Professor A : So everybody everybody 's on ? PhD D : Today 's Professor A : Yeah . So y you guys had a { disfmarker } a meeting with uh { disfmarker } with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss . Um and uh somebody PhD C : Mmm . Professor A : eh e and uh I guess Chuck you were n't there either , so the uh PhD B : I was there . Professor A : Oh you were there ? PhD B : With Hynek ? Professor A : Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . Professor A : So everybody knows what happened except me . OK . { vocalsound } Maybe somebody should tell me . PhD C : Oh yeah . Alright . Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week . Professor A : Uh - huh . PhD C : So . Yeah . About the um , well { disfmarker } the downsampling problem . Professor A : Yeah . PhD C : Uh and about the f the length of the filters and { disfmarker } Yeah . Professor A : What was the { disfmarker } w what was the downsampling problem again ? PhD C : So we had { disfmarker } Professor A : I forget . PhD C : So the fact that there { disfmarker } there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling . Well . Professor A : Uh - huh . PhD C : There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best w m Professor A : Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah . PhD C : Well . Mm - hmm . Professor A : So you could do a { disfmarker } you could do a stricter one . PhD D : System on Professor A : Maybe . Yeah . PhD C : Yeah . So we discussed about this , about the um { disfmarker } Professor A : Was there any conclusion about that ? PhD C : Uh `` try it `` . Yeah . Professor A : I see . PhD C : I guess . Professor A : Yeah . So again this is th this is the downsampling { vocalsound } uh of the uh { disfmarker } the feature vector stream PhD C : Uh . Professor A : and um Yeah I guess the { disfmarker } the uh LDA filters they were doing do have um { vocalsound } uh let 's see , so the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds so uh the question is how far down they are at fifty { disfmarker } fifty hertz . Uh . { vocalsound } Um . PhD C : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Professor A : Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two . So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ? PhD C : We do n't have yet Professor A : Oh OK . PhD C : um { vocalsound } So , yeah . Professor A : OK . PhD C : We should have a look first at , perhaps , { vocalsound } the modulation spectrum . Professor A : Yeah . PhD C : Um . So there is this , there is the um length of the filters . Um . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays . Um . We started to work with this . Professor A : Hmm - hmm . PhD C : Mmm . And the third point um { vocalsound } { vocalsound } was the um , yeah , { vocalsound } the on - line normalization where , well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation { vocalsound } is a filter with some kind of delay Professor A : Yeah . PhD C : and that 's not taken into account right now . Um . Yeah . And there again , yeah . For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , `` we can try it but { disfmarker } `` Professor A : Uh - huh . PhD C : Um . Professor A : Try { disfmarker } try what ? PhD C : So try to um { vocalsound } { vocalsound } um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation . Professor A : OK . PhD C : Mmm . And this { disfmarker } we 've not uh worked on this yet . Um , yeah . And so while discussing about these { disfmarker } these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's uh , well , we do n't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response and there is the fact that { vocalsound } in the very low frequency , these filters do n't { disfmarker } do n't really remove a lot . { vocalsound } compared to the { disfmarker } to the uh standard RASTA filter . Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it { disfmarker } it , Professor A : Right . PhD C : yeah , it removed this mean . Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could { disfmarker } should be { disfmarker } could be in the filter , I mean , uh the { disfmarker } the mean normalization and { disfmarker } Yeah . So . Yeah . So basically that was { disfmarker } that 's { vocalsound } all we discussed about . We discussed about { vocalsound } good things to do also uh well , generally good stuff { vocalsound } to do for the research . Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and { vocalsound } Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS , so . Professor A : OK . PhD C : Yeah , Professor A : I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is { disfmarker } is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides PhD C : um . Professor A : cuz { disfmarker } because um PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor A : uh I was talking with Hynek about it later and the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } sort of had the sense sort of that { disfmarker } that neither group of people wanted to { disfmarker } to bother the other group too much . And { disfmarker } and I do n't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things but I think that { vocalsound } you were sort of waiting for them to { vocalsound } tell you that they had something for you and { disfmarker } and that { disfmarker } and expected that they would do certain things and they were sor they did n't wan na bother you PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor A : and { vocalsound } they were sort of waiting for you and { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and uh we ended up with this thing where they { disfmarker } they were filling up all of the possible latency themselves , and they just had had n't thought of that . So . Uh . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } I mean it 's true that maybe { disfmarker } maybe no one really thought about that { disfmarker } that this latency thing would be such a { disfmarker } a strict issue PhD C : Yeah . Well , but . Yeah . Yeah . Well { disfmarker } Professor A : in { disfmarker } in uh { disfmarker } the other { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah I do n't know what happened really , but Professor A : Yeah . PhD C : I guess it 's { disfmarker } it 's also so uh the time constraints . Because , { vocalsound } well , we discussed about that { disfmarker } about this problem and they told us `` well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network `` but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and Professor A : Then they could n't . I see . PhD C : uh yeah . But there was also problem { disfmarker } perhaps a problem of communication . So , yeah . Now we will try to { disfmarker } Professor A : Just talk more . PhD C : Yeah , slikes and send mails . Professor A : Yeah . PhD C : u s o o Yeah . Professor A : Yeah . PhD C : Uh . OK . Professor A : So there 's um { disfmarker } Alright . Well maybe we should just uh I mean you 're { disfmarker } you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the { disfmarker } all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before right ? And this { disfmarker } machines are busy and { vocalsound } you 're busy PhD C : Yeah . Professor A : and PhD C : Basically . Professor A : Yeah . OK . Oh . PhD C : Um . Professor A : Let 's { disfmarker } let 's , I mean , I think that as { disfmarker } as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there { disfmarker } there will be { vocalsound } uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor A : in addition to the uh other things that we 're talking about and that 's probably the best thing to do . And there was that one email that said that { vocalsound } it sounded like uh uh things looked very promising up there in terms of uh I think they were using Ericsson 's { vocalsound } approach or something and { vocalsound } in addition to { disfmarker } They 're doing some noise removal thing , right ? PhD C : Yeah , yeah . So yeah we 're { disfmarker } will start to do this also . Professor A : Yeah . PhD C : Uh so Carmen is just looking at the Ericsson { disfmarker } Ericsson code . PhD D : Yeah . We modif Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : And PhD D : Yeah , I modified it { disfmarker } well , modifying { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I studied Barry 's sim code , more or less . to take @ @ the first step the spectral subtraction . and we have some { disfmarker } the feature for Italian database and we will try with this feature with the filter to find the result . Professor A : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD D : But we have n't result until this moment . Professor A : Yeah , sure . PhD D : But well , we are working in this also Professor A : Yeah . PhD D : and maybe try another type of spectral subtraction , I do n't { disfmarker } Professor A : When you say you do n't have a result yet you mean it 's { disfmarker } it 's just that it 's in process or that you { disfmarker } { vocalsound } it finished and it did n't get a good result ? PhD D : No . No , no n we have n we have do the experiment only have the feature { disfmarker } the feature but the experiment have PhD C : Yeah . PhD D : we have not make the experiment Professor A : Oh . OK . PhD D : and maybe will be good result or bad result , we do n't know . Professor A : Yeah . Yeah . PhD C : Yeah . Professor A : OK . So um I suggest actually now we { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } we sorta move on and { disfmarker } and hear what 's { disfmarker } what 's { disfmarker } what 's happening in { disfmarker } in other areas like { vocalsound } what 's { disfmarker } what 's happening with your { vocalsound } investigations { vocalsound } about echos and so on . Grad F : Oh um Well um I have n't started writing the test yet , I 'm meeting with Adam today Professor A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : um and he 's going t show me the scripts he has for um { vocalsound } { vocalsound } running recognition on mee Meeting Recorder digits . Professor A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Uh { vocalsound } I also um { vocalsound } { vocalsound } have n't got the code yet , I have n't asked Hynek for { disfmarker } for the { disfmarker } for his code yet . Cuz I looked at uh Avendano 's thesis and { vocalsound } I do n't really understand what he 's doing yet but it { disfmarker } { vocalsound } it { disfmarker } it sounded like um { vocalsound } the channel normalization part { vocalsound } um of his thesis um { vocalsound } was done in a { disfmarker } a bit of I do n't know what the word is , a { disfmarker } a bit of a rough way um { vocalsound } it sounded like he um he { disfmarker } he { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } it was n't really fleshed out and maybe he did something that was { vocalsound } interesting for the test situation but I { disfmarker } I 'm not sure if it 's { vocalsound } what I 'd wan na use so I have to { disfmarker } I have to read it more , I do n't really understand what he 's doing yet . Professor A : OK . Yeah I have n't read it in a while so I 'm not gon na be too much help unless I read it again , PhD D : It 's my PhD C : Oh yeah ? PhD D : I know this is mine here . Professor A : so . OK . Um . { vocalsound } The um { disfmarker } so you , and then { vocalsound } you 're also gon na be doing this echo cancelling between the { disfmarker } the close mounted and the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } and the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } what we 're calling a cheating experiment uh of sorts between the distant { disfmarker } Grad F : Uh I I 'm ho Right . Well { disfmarker } { vocalsound } or I 'm hoping { disfmarker } I 'm hoping Espen will do it . Professor A : Ah ! OK . Grad F : Um Professor A : F um Grad F : u Professor A : Delegate . That 's good . It 's good to delegate . Grad F : I { disfmarker } I think he 's at least planning to do it for the cl close - mike cross - talk and so maybe I can just take whatever setup he has and use it . Professor A : Great . Great . Yeah actually um he should uh I wonder who else is I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing uh a different cancellation . Um . { vocalsound } One of the things that people working in the meeting task wan na get at is they would like to have cleaner { vocalsound } close - miked recordings . So uh this is especially true for the lapel but even for the close { disfmarker } close - miked uh cases um we 'd like to be able to have { vocalsound } um other sounds from other people and so forth removed from { disfmarker } So when someone is n't speaking you 'd like the part where they 're not speaking to actually be { disfmarker } So { vocalsound } what they 're talking about doing is using ec uh echo cancellation - like techniques . It 's not really echo but { vocalsound } uh just um uh taking the input from other mikes and using uh { vocalsound } uh a uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that uh other speech . So . Um what was it , there was { disfmarker } there was some { disfmarker } some { disfmarker } some point where { vocalsound } eh uh Eric or somebody was { disfmarker } was speaking and he had lots of { vocalsound } silence in his channel and I was saying something to somebody else uh { vocalsound } which was in the background and it was not { disfmarker } it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech { vocalsound } on the close { disfmarker } { vocalsound } close mike . Grad F : Hmm . PhD B : Oh the { disfmarker } What we talked about yesterday ? Professor A : Yes . PhD B : Yeah that was actually my { disfmarker } I was wearing the { disfmarker } I was wearing the lapel and you were sitting next to me , Professor A : Oh you { disfmarker } it was you I was Yeah . PhD B : and I only said one thing but you were talking and it was picking up all your words . Professor A : Yeah . Yeah . So they would like clean channels . Uh and for that { disfmarker } mmm uh { disfmarker } that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out . So I think { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to uh work on that . So . OK . Right ? Um . { vocalsound } And uh I do n't know if we 've talked lately about the { disfmarker } the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning uh I do n't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but { vocalsound } maybe just a quick reprise of { disfmarker } of what we were saying this morning . Grad E : OK . Professor A : Uh . Grad E : Um . { comment } So continuing to um extend PhD B : What about the stuff that um Mirjam has been doing ? And { disfmarker } and S Shawn , yeah . Oh . So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features ? I see . Professor A : But that 's uh uh all { disfmarker } that 's { disfmarker } is a { disfmarker } a certainly relevant { comment } { vocalsound } uh study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . We have this problem with the overloading of the term `` feature `` so PhD B : Yeah . Professor A : uh { vocalsound } what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found { disfmarker } finding useful PhD C : Hmm . Professor A : um for { disfmarker } PhD B : And their { disfmarker } their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . Professor A : Right . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gon na try and do something more f more fine than that but uh um so um So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that { disfmarker } ? Yeah . Grad E : Oh yeah . Professor A : There 's those { vocalsound } { pause } that uh yeah , some of { disfmarker } some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on { disfmarker } on uh { vocalsound } what `` good features `` are and { disfmarker } PhD B : What does { disfmarker } what did um Larry Saul use for { disfmarker } it was the sonorant uh detector , right ? How did he { disfmarker } H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Oh , OK . Mm - hmm . So how did he combine all these features ? What { disfmarker } what r mmm classifier did he Hmm . Oh right . You were talking about that , yeah . I see . Professor A : And the other thing you were talking about is { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } is where we get the targets from . So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the { disfmarker } what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft `` AND - OR `` or you do something , you know , more complicated um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels { vocalsound } from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why do n't you tell us again about this { disfmarker } this database ? This is the { disfmarker } PhD B : Hmm ! Professor A : And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . PhD B : Pierced tongues and Yeah . You could just mount it to that and they would n't even notice . Weld it . Zzz . Professor A : Maybe you could go to these parlors and { disfmarker } and you could , you know { disfmarker } you know have { disfmarker } have , you know , reduced rates if you { disfmarker } { vocalsound } if you can do the measurements . PhD B : Yeah . I That 's right . You could { disfmarker } what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things Professor A : Yeah . Yeah , be cool and help science . PhD B : and Yeah . Professor A : OK . PhD B : Hmm ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that { disfmarker } people have done studies like that w way way back right ? I mean { vocalsound } I ca n't remember where { disfmarker } uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of { disfmarker } Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ? Um , { vocalsound } { vocalsound } researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . I ca n't remember what his name was . Dang . Now I 'll think of it . That 's interesting . Professor A : Do you mean eh { disfmarker } but you { disfmarker } I mean { disfmarker } Mar PhD C : Well he was the guy { disfmarker } the guy that was using { disfmarker } Professor A : you mean when was { disfmarker } was Mark Randolph there , or { disfmarker } ? PhD B : Mark Randolph . Professor A : Yeah he 's { disfmarker } he 's { disfmarker } he 's at Motorola now . PhD B : Oh is he ? Professor A : Yeah . PhD B : Oh OK . Professor A : Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . PhD C : Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or { disfmarker } ? PhD B : I ca n't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know { disfmarker } I just remember it had to do with you know { vocalsound } uh positional parameters PhD C : What { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD B : and trying to m you know do speech recognition based on them . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor A : Yeah . So the only { disfmarker } the only uh hesitation I had about it since , I mean I have n't see the data is it sounds like it 's { disfmarker } it 's { vocalsound } continuous variables and a bunch of them . And so PhD B : Hmm . Professor A : I do n't know how complicated it is to go from there { disfmarker } What you really want are these binary { pause } labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wan na do it and it 's e but it { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas um { vocalsound } if you did something instead that { disfmarker } like um having some manual annotation by { vocalsound } uh you know , linguistics students , this would { disfmarker } there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with { disfmarker } with John before PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : And then there would { disfmarker } it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable . Course then , that 's the other question is do you want binary variables . So . I mean the other thing you could do is { vocalsound } boot trying to { disfmarker } to uh get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from { vocalsound } uh the uh { vocalsound } uh the data itself there , but I { disfmarker } I 'm not sure { disfmarker } PhD B : Could you cluster the { disfmarker } just do some kind of clustering ? Professor A : Guess you could , yeah . PhD B : Bin them up into different categories and { disfmarker } Professor A : Yeah . So anyway that 's { disfmarker } that 's uh { disfmarker } that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at . Um . { vocalsound } Um . { vocalsound } I mean in general it 's gon na be { disfmarker } for new data that you look at , it 's gon na be hidden variable because we 're not gon na get everybody sitting in these meetings to { vocalsound } wear the pellets and { disfmarker } Um . So . Grad E : Right . Right . PhD B : So you 're talking about using that data to get uh instead of using canonical mappings of phones . Grad E : Right . PhD B : So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } the true mappings are for each phone ? Grad E : Mm - hmm . PhD B : I see . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor A : Yeah . So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in { disfmarker } in my mind , I guess , is that um { vocalsound } we 're looking at different ways that we can combine { vocalsound } uh different kinds of { disfmarker } of rep front - end representations { vocalsound } um in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from { vocalsound } uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have { vocalsound } a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one { disfmarker } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } one um articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that { vocalsound } to change some of the other methods we have , since { disfmarker } I mean , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that { disfmarker } that it { disfmarker } it um { disfmarker } the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a { disfmarker } a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than { vocalsound } um just assuming { vocalsound } that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength { vocalsound } towards uh it being this phone or that phone . Right ? So it { disfmarker } so um { vocalsound } he 's got these um uh uh PhD B : Hmm . Professor A : he `` AND 's `` between these different { vocalsound } features . It 's a soft `` AND `` , I guess but in { disfmarker } in principle { vocalsound } you { disfmarker } you wan na get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he `` OR 's `` across the different { disfmarker } soft `` OR 's `` across the different uh { vocalsound } multi - band channels . And um { vocalsound } the weight yeah , the target for the training of the `` AND `` { disfmarker } `` AND ' ed `` things { vocalsound } is something that 's kept { vocalsound } uh as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is { disfmarker } is uh { vocalsound } taking { vocalsound } the phone target and then just back propagating from that PhD B : So he does n't have { disfmarker } Professor A : which means that it 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } it 's uh i It could be for instance { vocalsound } that for a particular point in the data { vocalsound } you do n't want to um uh train a particular band { disfmarker } train the detectors for a particular band . You { disfmarker } you wan na ignore { vocalsound } that band , cuz that 's a { disfmarker } Ban - band is a noisy { disfmarker } noisy measure . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : And we do n't { disfmarker } We 're { disfmarker } we 're still gon na try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gon na try to train it up to do as well { disfmarker } well as it can at predicting . Uh . Maybe that 's not the right thing to do . PhD B : So he does n't have to have truth marks or { disfmarker } Ho Grad E : F right , and uh he does n't have to have hard labels . Professor A : Well at the { disfmarker } at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's { disfmarker } where it 's sonorant . But he 's { disfmarker } but what he 's - but what he 's not training up { disfmarker } uh what he does n't depend on as truth is Grad E : Right . For the full band . Professor A : um I guess one way of describing would be if { disfmarker } if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? Grad E : Right . Professor A : Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . So PhD B : Mm - hmm . OK . Professor A : then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band { vocalsound } towards making your decision . And um { vocalsound } uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should { disfmarker } you should use everything { vocalsound } uh with { disfmarker } with uh equal strength . PhD B : I see . Professor A : And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had { vocalsound } uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the { disfmarker } if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But um this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from { disfmarker } from the beginning and so you do n't necessarily want to train everything up towards the { disfmarker } PhD B : So where did he get his { disfmarker } uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? Grad E : From uh canonical mappings { comment } um at first PhD B : OK . Professor A : Yeah . Grad E : and then it 's unclear um eh PhD B : Using TIMIT ? or using { disfmarker } Grad E : using TIMIT PhD B : Uh - huh . Grad E : right , right . Professor A : Yeah . Grad E : And then uh he does some fine tuning um for um special cases . Yeah . Professor A : Yeah . I mean we ha we have a kind of { vocalsound } iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi , uh so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data but it 's { disfmarker } it 's not { disfmarker } I think it s does n't seem like it 's quite the same , cuz of this { disfmarker } cuz then whatever { vocalsound } that alignment is , it 's that for all { disfmarker } all bands . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate { disfmarker } tried to do them separately so that would be a little more like what he did . Um . But it 's still { vocalsound } not quite the same because then it 's { disfmarker } it 's um setting targets based on where you would say { vocalsound } the sound begins in a particular band . Where he 's s this is not a labeling per se . Might be closer I guess if we did a { vocalsound } soft { disfmarker } soft target uh { vocalsound } uh embedded { vocalsound } neural net training like we 've done a few times uh { vocalsound } f the forward um { disfmarker } do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those . Mmm . Uh what 's next ? PhD B : I could say a little bit about w stuff I 've been playing with . Professor A : Oh . You 're playing ? PhD B : I um Huh ? Professor A : You 're playing ? PhD B : Yes , I 'm playing . Um { vocalsound } so I wanted to do this experiment to see um { vocalsound } uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this um { disfmarker } I think I sent around last week a { disfmarker } { vocalsound } this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where { vocalsound } I would take the um { disfmarker } the original um the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then uh do the same thing for { vocalsound } the ICSI - OGI front - end . Professor A : What { disfmarker } which test set was this ? PhD B : This is { disfmarker } that I looked at ? Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now . Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh { vocalsound } been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK { vocalsound } system for the Italian data and got the same results that um { disfmarker } that uh { vocalsound } Stephane had . So um I started looking { disfmarker } to { disfmarker } and now I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wan na know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to { disfmarker } uh to improve it . So . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use { vocalsound } the same number of states for all of the models Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits . Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a { disfmarker } an HMM system is that you use { vocalsound } um three states per phone and um { vocalsound } so then the { disfmarker } the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Um . { vocalsound } Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use { vocalsound } uh models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . They 've got those initial and final null states . And so um { vocalsound } { vocalsound } their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five { vocalsound } which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : And so they had sixteen . So that 's pretty close . Um { vocalsound } { vocalsound } but for the { disfmarker } most of the words are sh much shorter . So the majority of them wan na have nine states . And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . So { vocalsound } my guess { disfmarker } uh And then if you { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I printed out a confusion matrix um { vocalsound } uh for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that { vocalsound } you know , if you assume a fixed { disfmarker } the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states , { vocalsound } { vocalsound } uh you 've got { disfmarker } you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've got ta train in each case , Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : So { vocalsound } it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's { disfmarker } because you have so many states , you just do n't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific { vocalsound } um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from . Professor A : Yeah , I mean , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the { disfmarker } for the longer word , PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : but . PhD B : Yeah so I 'll { disfmarker } I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gon na try is to just um you know create { vocalsound } uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um { disfmarker } how these models were coming out , you know , what w { vocalsound } when we train up uh th you know , the model for `` one `` , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the { disfmarker } uh what do the transition probabilities look like { disfmarker } in the self - loops , { comment } look like in { disfmarker } in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can { vocalsound } calculate the expected duration of an HMM just by looking at the transition matrix Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gon na sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , Professor A : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD B : you know , the long ones versus the short ones . I d I did { disfmarker } quickly , I did the silence model and { disfmarker } { vocalsound } and um that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the { vocalsound } string of digits . Professor A : Wow . Lots of silence . PhD B : Yeah , yeah . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I { disfmarker } I have n't calculated that for that one yet , but um . So they basically { disfmarker } their { disfmarker } { vocalsound } their model for a whole digit string is silence { vocalsound } digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . And so . Professor A : Are the SP 's optional ? I mean skip them ? PhD B : I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's { disfmarker } it 's not gon na hurt a whole lot Professor A : I see . PhD B : and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own { disfmarker } um It does n't require its own training data , Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : it just shares that state . Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : So it , I mean , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but um i So I wan na play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know { vocalsound } how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wan na compare that in the { disfmarker } the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of { disfmarker } just from looking at the { vocalsound } durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . Professor A : Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z PhD B : Yeah . Professor A : The premise is kind of you have a { disfmarker } a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? PhD B : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor A : And uh PhD B : And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um { vocalsound } the { disfmarker } the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , { vocalsound } you would n't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models . Professor A : Could be . PhD B : And compare how they perform to that . But { vocalsound } you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . Professor A : Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : I mean , I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } what I thought you were gon na say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so . PhD B : Yeah . Right . Professor A : Uh { vocalsound } that 's another parameter , right ? that { disfmarker } that maybe , you know , uh { disfmarker } you really want three or nine or { disfmarker } PhD B : Yeah , yeah . Well one thing { disfmarker } I mean , if I { disfmarker } if { disfmarker } if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models { vocalsound } that 's gon na reduce the total number of Gaussians . Professor A : Right . PhD B : So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system . Professor A : Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things PhD B : Yeah . Professor A : how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gon na do that is going to blow up the amount of computation PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : um so PhD B : Right . Right . Professor A : if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : Does n't have to go down . PhD B : Yeah . I really was n't even gon na play with that part of the system yet , Professor A : Mm - hmm , OK . PhD B : I was just gon na change the { disfmarker } the t Professor A : Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . PhD B : yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens . Professor A : Yeah . PhD B : So . Professor A : Cool . OK . So uh { vocalsound } what 's uh I guess your plan for { disfmarker } You { disfmarker } you { disfmarker } you guys ' plan for the next { disfmarker } next week is { vocalsound } just continue on these { disfmarker } these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and PhD C : Yeah , I guess we can try to { vocalsound } have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps . with all these minor things { vocalsound } { vocalsound } modified . And then do other things , play with the spectral subtraction , and { vocalsound } retry the MSG and things like that . Professor A : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah we { disfmarker } we have a big list . PhD C : Big list ? Professor A : You have a big list of { disfmarker } { vocalsound } of things to do . So . Well that 's good . I think { vocalsound } that after all of this uh um confusion settles down in another { disfmarker } some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there and { vocalsound } hopefully it 'll have some effect from something { vocalsound } that { disfmarker } { vocalsound } that has uh been done by our group of people but uh e even if it does n't there 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } there 's go there 'll be standards after that . So . PhD B : Does anybody know how to um { vocalsound } run Matlab sort of in batch mode like you c send it { vocalsound } s a bunch of commands to run and it gives you the output . Is it possible to do that ? Grad E : I { disfmarker } I think uh Mike tried it PhD B : Yeah ? Grad E : and he says it 's impossible so he went to Octave . PhD B : Octave . Grad E : Octave is the um UNIX clone of { disfmarker } of Matlab which you can batch . PhD B : Ah ! OK . Great . Thanks . Grad E : Yeah . PhD B : I was going crazy trying to do that . Professor A : Huh . Grad E : Yeah . PhD C : What is Octave so ? It 's a free software ? Grad E : What 's that ? Uh , Octave ? PhD C : Yeah . Grad E : Yeah it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } it 's free . I think we have it here { comment } r running somewhere . PhD B : Great ! Grad E : Yeah . PhD C : And it does the same syntax and everything eh like Matlab , or { disfmarker } ? Grad E : Um { vocalsound } { comment } i it 's a little behind , it 's the same syntax but it 's a little behind in that { comment } Matlab went to these like um you can have cells and you can { disfmarker } you can { comment } uh implement object - oriented type things with Matlab . Uh Octave does n't do that yet , so I think you , Octave is kinda like Matlab um four point something or . PhD B : If it 'll do like a lot of the basic matrix and vector stuff Grad E : The basic stuff , right . PhD B : that 's perfect . Grad E : Yeah . PhD B : Great ! Professor A : OK , guess we 're done . Grad E : OK . Grad F : Well , although by the way . 
Query : Summarize the discussion on detecting important linguistic features Professor A : Yeah . Yeah . So they would like clean channels . Uh and for that { disfmarker } mmm uh { disfmarker } that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out . So I think { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to uh work on that . So . OK . Right ? Um . { vocalsound } And uh I do n't know if we 've talked lately about the { disfmarker } the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning uh I do n't remember if we talked about that last week or not , but { vocalsound } maybe just a quick reprise of { disfmarker } of what we were saying this morning . Grad E : OK . Professor A : Uh . Grad E : Um . { comment } So continuing to um extend PhD B : What about the stuff that um Mirjam has been doing ? And { disfmarker } and S Shawn , yeah . Oh . So they 're training up nets to try to recognize these acoustic features ? I see . Professor A : But that 's uh uh all { disfmarker } that 's { disfmarker } is a { disfmarker } a certainly relevant { comment } { vocalsound } uh study and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding . We have this problem with the overloading of the term `` feature `` so PhD B : Yeah . Professor A : uh { vocalsound } what are the variables , what we 're calling this one , what are the variables that they 're found { disfmarker } finding useful PhD C : Hmm . Professor A : um for { disfmarker } PhD B : And their { disfmarker } their targets are based on canonical mappings of phones to acoustic f features . Professor A : Right . And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gon na try and do something more f more fine than that but uh um so um So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying , do you ha still have that { disfmarker } ? Yeah . Grad E : Oh yeah . Professor A : There 's those { vocalsound } { pause } that uh yeah , some of { disfmarker } some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on { disfmarker } on uh { vocalsound } what `` good features `` are and { disfmarker } PhD B : What does { disfmarker } what did um Larry Saul use for { disfmarker } it was the sonorant uh detector , right ? How did he { disfmarker } H how did he do that ? Wh - what was his detector ? Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Oh , OK . Mm - hmm . So how did he combine all these features ? What { disfmarker } what r mmm classifier did he Hmm . Oh right . You were talking about that , yeah . I see . Professor A : And the other thing you were talking about is { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } is where we get the targets from . So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the { disfmarker } what are the variables that you use and do you combine them using the soft `` AND - OR `` or you do something , you know , more complicated um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ? The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels { vocalsound } from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation . But then the other thing is to do something better and eh w why do n't you tell us again about this { disfmarker } this database ? This is the { disfmarker } PhD B : Hmm ! Professor A : And then tell them to talk naturally ? Yeah , yeah . PhD B : Pierced tongues and Yeah . You could just mount it to that and they would n't even notice . Weld it . Zzz . Professor A : Maybe you could go to these parlors and { disfmarker } and you could , you know { disfmarker } you know have { disfmarker } have , you know , reduced rates if you { disfmarker } { vocalsound } if you can do the measurements . PhD B : Yeah . I That 's right . You could { disfmarker } what you could do is you could sell little rings and stuff with embedded you know , transmitters in them and things Professor A : Yeah . Yeah , be cool and help science . PhD B : and Yeah . Professor A : OK . PhD B : Hmm ! There 's a bunch of data that l around , that { disfmarker } people have done studies like that w way way back right ? I mean { vocalsound } I ca n't remember where { disfmarker } uh Wisconsin or someplace that used to have a big database of { disfmarker } Yeah . I remember there was this guy at A T - andT , Randolph ? or r What was his name ? Do you remember that guy ? Um , { vocalsound } { vocalsound } researcher at A T - andT a while back that was studying , trying to do speech recognition from these kinds of features . I ca n't remember what his name was . Dang . Now I 'll think of it . That 's interesting . Professor A : Do you mean eh { disfmarker } but you { disfmarker } I mean { disfmarker } Mar PhD C : Well he was the guy { disfmarker } the guy that was using { disfmarker } Professor A : you mean when was { disfmarker } was Mark Randolph there , or { disfmarker } ? PhD B : Mark Randolph . Professor A : Yeah he 's { disfmarker } he 's { disfmarker } he 's at Motorola now . PhD B : Oh is he ? Professor A : Yeah . PhD B : Oh OK . Professor A : Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . PhD C : Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue or { disfmarker } ? PhD B : I ca n't remember exactly what he was using , now . But I know { disfmarker } I just remember it had to do with you know { vocalsound } uh positional parameters PhD C : What { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD B : and trying to m you know do speech recognition based on them . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor A : Yeah . So the only { disfmarker } the only uh hesitation I had about it since , I mean I have n't see the data is it sounds like it 's { disfmarker } it 's { vocalsound } continuous variables and a bunch of them . And so PhD B : Hmm . Professor A : I do n't know how complicated it is to go from there { disfmarker } What you really want are these binary { pause } labels , and just a few of them . And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wan na do it and it 's e but it { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself , whereas um { vocalsound } if you did something instead that { disfmarker } like um having some manual annotation by { vocalsound } uh you know , linguistics students , this would { disfmarker } there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with { disfmarker } with John before PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : And then there would { disfmarker } it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable . Course then , that 's the other question is do you want binary variables . So . I mean the other thing you could do is { vocalsound } boot trying to { disfmarker } to uh get those binary variables and take the continuous variables from { vocalsound } uh the uh { vocalsound } uh the data itself there , but I { disfmarker } I 'm not sure { disfmarker } PhD B : Could you cluster the { disfmarker } just do some kind of clustering ? Professor A : Guess you could , yeah . PhD B : Bin them up into different categories and { disfmarker } Professor A : Yeah . So anyway that 's { disfmarker } that 's uh { disfmarker } that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at . Um . { vocalsound } Um . { vocalsound } I mean in general it 's gon na be { disfmarker } for new data that you look at , it 's gon na be hidden variable because we 're not gon na get everybody sitting in these meetings to { vocalsound } wear the pellets and { disfmarker } Um . So . Grad E : Right . Right . PhD B : So you 're talking about using that data to get uh instead of using canonical mappings of phones . Grad E : Right . PhD B : So you 'd use that data to give you sort of what the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } the true mappings are for each phone ? Grad E : Mm - hmm . PhD B : I see . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor A : Yeah . So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in { disfmarker } in my mind , I guess , is that um { vocalsound } we 're looking at different ways that we can combine { vocalsound } uh different kinds of { disfmarker } of rep front - end representations { vocalsound } um in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions . And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from { vocalsound } uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things and Saul seems to have { vocalsound } a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one { disfmarker } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } one um articulatory feature . The question is is can we learn from that { vocalsound } to change some of the other methods we have , since { disfmarker } I mean , one of the things that 's nice about what he had I thought was that { disfmarker } that it { disfmarker } it um { disfmarker } the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a { disfmarker } a reasonable criterion with hidden variables rather than { vocalsound } um just assuming { vocalsound } that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength { vocalsound } towards uh it being this phone or that phone . Right ? So it { disfmarker } so um { vocalsound } he 's got these um uh uh PhD B : Hmm . Professor A : he `` AND 's `` between these different { vocalsound } features . It 's a soft `` AND `` , I guess but in { disfmarker } in principle { vocalsound } you { disfmarker } you wan na get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something and then he `` OR 's `` across the different { disfmarker } soft `` OR 's `` across the different uh { vocalsound } multi - band channels . And um { vocalsound } the weight yeah , the target for the training of the `` AND `` { disfmarker } `` AND ' ed `` things { vocalsound } is something that 's kept { vocalsound } uh as a hidden variable , and is learned with EM . Whereas what we were doing is { disfmarker } is uh { vocalsound } taking { vocalsound } the phone target and then just back propagating from that PhD B : So he does n't have { disfmarker } Professor A : which means that it 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } it 's uh i It could be for instance { vocalsound } that for a particular point in the data { vocalsound } you do n't want to um uh train a particular band { disfmarker } train the detectors for a particular band . You { disfmarker } you wan na ignore { vocalsound } that band , cuz that 's a { disfmarker } Ban - band is a noisy { disfmarker } noisy measure . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : And we do n't { disfmarker } We 're { disfmarker } we 're still gon na try to train it up . In our scheme we 're gon na try to train it up to do as well { disfmarker } well as it can at predicting . Uh . Maybe that 's not the right thing to do . PhD B : So he does n't have to have truth marks or { disfmarker } Ho Grad E : F right , and uh he does n't have to have hard labels . Professor A : Well at the { disfmarker } at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's { disfmarker } where it 's sonorant . But he 's { disfmarker } but what he 's - but what he 's not training up { disfmarker } uh what he does n't depend on as truth is Grad E : Right . For the full band . Professor A : um I guess one way of describing would be if { disfmarker } if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ? Is it sonorant in that band ? Grad E : Right . Professor A : Is it sonorant in that band ? i It 's hard to even answer that what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant . So PhD B : Mm - hmm . OK . Professor A : then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band { vocalsound } towards making your decision . And um { vocalsound } uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should { disfmarker } you should use everything { vocalsound } uh with { disfmarker } with uh equal strength . PhD B : I see . Professor A : And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities , if we had { vocalsound } uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities and if the { disfmarker } if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can . But um this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from { disfmarker } from the beginning and so you do n't necessarily want to train everything up towards the { disfmarker } PhD B : So where did he get his { disfmarker } uh his tar his uh high - level targets about what 's sonorant and what 's not ? Grad E : From uh canonical mappings { comment } um at first PhD B : OK . Professor A : Yeah . 
Query : What did the professor think about clustering ? Professor A : Guess you could , yeah . PhD B : Bin them up into different categories and { disfmarker } Professor A : Yeah . So anyway that 's { disfmarker } that 's uh { disfmarker } that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at . Um . { vocalsound } Um . { vocalsound } I mean in general it 's gon na be { disfmarker } for new data that you look at , it 's gon na be hidden variable because we 're not gon na get everybody sitting in these meetings to { vocalsound } wear the pellets and { disfmarker } Um .

Query : Summarize the discussion on improving the back recognizer for the Aurora task Professor A : Oh . You 're playing ? PhD B : I um Huh ? Professor A : You 're playing ? PhD B : Yes , I 'm playing . Um { vocalsound } so I wanted to do this experiment to see um { vocalsound } uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things . And so I had this um { disfmarker } I think I sent around last week a { disfmarker } { vocalsound } this plan I had for an experiment , this matrix where { vocalsound } I would take the um { disfmarker } the original um the original system . So there 's the original system trained on the mel cepstral features and then com and then uh optimize the b HTK system and run that again . So look at the difference there and then uh do the same thing for { vocalsound } the ICSI - OGI front - end . Professor A : What { disfmarker } which test set was this ? PhD B : This is { disfmarker } that I looked at ? Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Uh I 'm looking at the Italian right now . Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : So as far as I 've gotten is I 've uh { vocalsound } been able to go through from beginning to end the um full HTK { vocalsound } system for the Italian data and got the same results that um { disfmarker } that uh { vocalsound } Stephane had . So um I started looking { disfmarker } to { disfmarker } and now I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wan na know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to { disfmarker } uh to improve it . So . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use { vocalsound } the same number of states for all of the models Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits . Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a { disfmarker } an HMM system is that you use { vocalsound } um three states per phone and um { vocalsound } so then the { disfmarker } the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Um . { vocalsound } Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use { vocalsound } uh models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . They 've got those initial and final null states . And so um { vocalsound } { vocalsound } their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five { vocalsound } which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : And so they had sixteen . So that 's pretty close . Um { vocalsound } { vocalsound } but for the { disfmarker } most of the words are sh much shorter . So the majority of them wan na have nine states . And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . So { vocalsound } my guess { disfmarker } uh And then if you { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I printed out a confusion matrix um { vocalsound } uh for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that { vocalsound } you know , if you assume a fixed { disfmarker } the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states , { vocalsound } { vocalsound } uh you 've got { disfmarker } you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've got ta train in each case , Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : So { vocalsound } it could be that , you know , for the short words there 's { disfmarker } because you have so many states , you just do n't have enough data to train all those Gaussians . So um I 'm going to try to um create more word - specific { vocalsound } um uh prototype H M Ms to start training from . Professor A : Yeah , I mean , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the { disfmarker } for the longer word , PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : but . PhD B : Yeah so I 'll { disfmarker } I 'll , the next experiment I 'm gon na try is to just um you know create { vocalsound } uh models that seem to be more w matched to my guess about how long they should be . Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : And as part of that um I wanted to see sort of how the um { disfmarker } how these models were coming out , you know , what w { vocalsound } when we train up uh th you know , the model for `` one `` , which wants to have nine states , you know , what is the { disfmarker } uh what do the transition probabilities look like { disfmarker } in the self - loops , { comment } look like in { disfmarker } in those models ? And so I talked to Andreas and he explained to me how you can { vocalsound } calculate the expected duration of an HMM just by looking at the transition matrix Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and so I wrote a little Matlab script that calculates that and so I 'm gon na sort of print those out for each of the words to see what 's happening , you know , how these models are training up , Professor A : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD B : you know , the long ones versus the short ones . I d I did { disfmarker } quickly , I did the silence model and { disfmarker } { vocalsound } and um that 's coming out with about one point two seconds as its average duration and the silence model 's the one that 's used at the beginning and the end of each of the { vocalsound } string of digits . Professor A : Wow . Lots of silence . PhD B : Yeah , yeah . And so the S P model , which is what they put in between digits , I { disfmarker } I have n't calculated that for that one yet , but um . So they basically { disfmarker } their { disfmarker } { vocalsound } their model for a whole digit string is silence { vocalsound } digit , SP , digit , SP blah - blah - blah and then silence at the end . And so . Professor A : Are the SP 's optional ? I mean skip them ? PhD B : I have to look at that , but I 'm not sure that they are . Now the one thing about the S P model is really it only has a single s emitting state to it . Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : So if it 's not optional , you know , it 's { disfmarker } it 's not gon na hurt a whole lot Professor A : I see . PhD B : and it 's tied to the center state of the silence model so it 's not its own { disfmarker } um It does n't require its own training data , Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : it just shares that state . Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : So it , I mean , it 's pretty good the way that they have it set up , but um i So I wan na play with that a little bit more . I 'm curious about looking at , you know { vocalsound } how these models have trained and looking at the expected durations of the models and I wan na compare that in the { disfmarker } the well - matched case f to the unmatched case , and see if you can get an idea of { disfmarker } just from looking at the { vocalsound } durations of these models , you know , what what 's happening . Professor A : Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : Not do anything that 's really finely tuned , but just sort of eh you know you t you i z PhD B : Yeah . Professor A : The premise is kind of you have a { disfmarker } a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ? PhD B : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor A : And uh PhD B : And Hynek , when I wa told him about this , he had an interesting point , and that was th um { vocalsound } the { disfmarker } the final models that they end up training up have I think probably something on the order of six Gaussians per state . So they 're fairly , you know , hefty models . And Hynek was saying that well , probably in a real application , { vocalsound } you would n't have enough compute to handle models that are very big or complicated . So in fact what we may want are simpler models . Professor A : Could be . PhD B : And compare how they perform to that . But { vocalsound } you know , it depends on what the actual application is and it 's really hard to know what your limits are in terms of how many Gaussians you can have . Professor A : Right . And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation , so . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : I mean , I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } what I thought you were gon na say i but which I was thinking was um where did six come from ? Probably came from the same place eighteen came from . You know , so . PhD B : Yeah . Right . Professor A : Uh { vocalsound } that 's another parameter , right ? that { disfmarker } that maybe , you know , uh { disfmarker } you really want three or nine or { disfmarker } PhD B : Yeah , yeah . Well one thing { disfmarker } I mean , if I { disfmarker } if { disfmarker } if I start um reducing the number of states for some of these shorter models { vocalsound } that 's gon na reduce the total number of Gaussians . Professor A : Right . PhD B : So in a sense it 'll be a simpler system . Professor A : Yeah . Yeah . But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things PhD B : Yeah . Professor A : how much better can you make it ? And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gon na do that is going to blow up the amount of computation PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : um so PhD B : Right . Right . Professor A : if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : Does n't have to go down . PhD B : Yeah . I really was n't even gon na play with that part of the system yet , Professor A : Mm - hmm , OK . PhD B : I was just gon na change the { disfmarker } the t Professor A : Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . PhD B : yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens . Professor A : Yeah . PhD B : So . 
Query : How did PhD B approach the back-end of the Aurora recognizer ? PhD B : Yes , I 'm playing . Um { vocalsound } so I wanted to do this experiment to see um { vocalsound } uh what happens if we try to uh improve the performance of the back - end recognizer for the Aurora task and see how that affects things .

So um I started looking { disfmarker } to { disfmarker } and now I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm sort of lookin at the point where I wan na know what should I change in the HTK back - end in order to try to { disfmarker } uh to improve it . So . One of the first things I thought of was the fact that they use { vocalsound } the same number of states for all of the models Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and so I went on - line and I uh found a pronunciation dictionary for Italian digits Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and just looked at , you know , the number of phones in each one of the digits . Um you know , sort of the canonical way of setting up a { disfmarker } an HMM system is that you use { vocalsound } um three states per phone and um { vocalsound } so then the { disfmarker } the total number of states for a word would just be , you know , the number of phones times three . And so when I did that for the Italian digits , I got a number of states , ranging on the low end from nine to the high end , eighteen . Um . { vocalsound } Now you have to really add two to that because in HTK there 's an initial null and a final null so when they use { vocalsound } uh models that have eighteen states , there 're really sixteen states . They 've got those initial and final null states . And so um { vocalsound } { vocalsound } their guess of eighteen states seems to be pretty well matched to the two longest words of the Italian digits , the four and five { vocalsound } which um , according to my , you know , sort of off the cuff calculation , should have eighteen states each . Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : And so they had sixteen . So that 's pretty close . Um { vocalsound } { vocalsound } but for the { disfmarker } most of the words are sh much shorter . So the majority of them wan na have nine states . And so theirs are s sort of twice as long . So { vocalsound } my guess { disfmarker } uh And then if you { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I printed out a confusion matrix um { vocalsound } uh for the well - matched case , and it turns out that the longest words are actually the ones that do the best . So my guess about what 's happening is that { vocalsound } you know , if you assume a fixed { disfmarker } the same amount of training data for each of these digits and a fixed length model for all of them but the actual words for some of them are half as long you really um have , you know , half as much training data for those models . Because if you have a long word and you 're training it to eighteen states , { vocalsound } { vocalsound } uh you 've got { disfmarker } you know , you 've got the same number of Gaussians , you 've got ta train in each case , Professor A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : but for the shorter words , you know , the total number of frames is actually half as many . 
Query : What did the professor think about improving the back recognizer for the Aurora task ? PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : um so PhD B : Right . Right . Professor A : if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor A : Does n't have to go down . PhD B : Yeah . I really was n't even gon na play with that part of the system yet , Professor A : Mm - hmm , OK . PhD B : I was just gon na change the { disfmarker } the t Professor A : Yeah , just work with the models , yeah . PhD B : yeah , just look at the length of the models and just see what happens . 
Query : What were the main discussion points of the meeting ? Professor E : So . OK . Does n't look like it crashed . That 's great . Grad G : So I think maybe what 's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it 's working . And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash . So , I wo n't do that anymore . Postdoc B : And it looks like you 've found a way of uh mapping the location to the { disfmarker } without having people have to give their names each time ? PhD A : Sounds like an initialization thing . Postdoc B : I mean it 's like you have the { disfmarker } So you know that { disfmarker } Grad G : No . Postdoc B : I mean , are you going to write down { pause } that I sat here ? Grad G : I 'm gon na collect the digit forms and write it down . Postdoc B : OK . PhD C : Oh , OK . Grad G : So { disfmarker } So they should be right with what 's on the digit forms . OK , so I 'll go ahead and start with digits . u And I should say that uh , you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly . Professor E : And start by giving the transcript number . PhD A : Tran PhD D : Transcript { disfmarker } Uh . OK , OK . PhD A : Oh sorry , go ahead . Professor E : So uh , you see , Don , the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project . Grad H : OK . Professor E : It 's just uh { disfmarker } Grad H : Umh . Professor E : Uh , you know , it does n't seem like a bad idea to have { comment } that information . Grad G : And I 'm surprised I sort of { disfmarker } I 'm surprised I forgot that , Professor E : Yeah , I { disfmarker } I 'd { disfmarker } I think it 's some Grad G : but uh I think that would be a good thing to add . After I just printed out a zillion of them . Professor E : Yeah , well , that 's { disfmarker } Um , so I { disfmarker } I do have a { disfmarker } a an agenda suggestion . Uh , we { disfmarker } I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple of weeks ago that we { disfmarker } we spent much of the time talking about the mundane stuff cuz that 's easier to get out of the way and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave . So { vocalsound } uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around and { disfmarker } and uh sort of we have { disfmarker } anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the { disfmarker } the research - y kind of things . Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a { disfmarker } a couple weeks before um uh about the uh { disfmarker } the stuff you were doing with { disfmarker } with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events , we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by `` events `` but I think , you know , what we had meant by `` events `` I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers . But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : like some other noise . PhD D : Uh - huh . Yeah . Professor E : Yes ? You mean that as an event also . PhD D : To Professor E : So at any rate you were { disfmarker } you 've { disfmarker } you 've done some work on that PhD D : right . Professor E : and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing . Um , I think especially since you { disfmarker } you have n't been in { disfmarker } in these meetings for a little bit , maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data , uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that { disfmarker } that uh { disfmarker } that uh Jane had with Lokendra uh about some { disfmarker } some { disfmarker } some um uh work about I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I d I { disfmarker } I do n't want to try to say cuz I { disfmarker } I 'll say it wrong , but anyway some { disfmarker } some potential collaboration there about { disfmarker } about the { disfmarker } about the { disfmarker } working with these data . PhD C : Oh . Sure . Professor E : So . So , uh . Grad G : You wan na just go around ? Professor E : Uh . { pause } Well , I do n't know if we { disfmarker } if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing , I think there 's just just a couple { disfmarker } a couple people primarily um but um Uh , wh why do n't { disfmarker } Actually I think that { disfmarker } that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly so why do n't you { disfmarker } you start with that . Postdoc B : OK . Shall I { disfmarker } shall I just start ? OK . Professor E : Yeah , just explain what it was . Postdoc B : Um , so , uh , he was interested in the question of { disfmarker } you know , relating to his { disfmarker } to the research he presented recently , um of inference structures , and uh , the need to build in , um , this { disfmarker } this sort of uh mechanism for understanding of language . And he gave the example in his talk about how { pause } um , e a I 'm remembering it just off the top of my head right now , but it 's something about how um , i `` Joe slipped `` you know , `` John had washed the floor `` or something like that . And I do n't have it quite right , but that kind of thing , where you have to draw the inference that , OK , there 's this time sequence , but also the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the causal aspects of the uh floor and { disfmarker } and how it might have been the cause of the fall and that um it was the other person who fell than the one who cleaned it and it { disfmarker } { comment } These sorts of things . So , I looked through the transcript that we have so far , { comment } and um , fou identified a couple different types of things of that type and um , one of them was something like uh , during the course of the transcript , um um , w we had gone through the part where everyone said which channel they were on and which device they were on , and um , the question was raised `` Well , should we restart the recording at this point ? `` And { disfmarker } and Dan Ellis said , `` Well , we 're just so far ahead of the game right now { pause } we really do n't need to `` . Now , how would you interpret that without a lot of inference ? So , the inferences that are involved are things like , OK , so , how do you interpret `` ahead of the game `` ? You know . So it 's the { disfmarker } it 's { pause } i What you { disfmarker } what you int what you draw { disfmarker } you know , the conclusions that you need to draw are that space is involved in recording , Grad G : Hmm , metaphorically . Postdoc B : that um , i that { pause } i we have enough space , and he continues , like `` we 're so ahead of the game cuz now we have built - in downsampling `` . So you have to sort of get the idea that um , `` ahead of the game `` is sp speaking with respect to space limitations , that um that in fact downsampling is gaining us enough space , and that therefore we can keep the recording we 've done so far . But there are a lot of different things like that . Grad G : So , do you think his interest is in using this as { pause } a data source , or { pause } training material , or what ? Professor E : Well , I { disfmarker } I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him , so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours Grad G : Mm - hmm . Professor E : and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data , uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're { disfmarker } already have and see , is there anything to this at all ? Grad G : Mm - hmm . Professor E : Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it . Cuz it could be that you 'd look through it and you say `` well , this is just the wrong { pause } task for { disfmarker } for him to pursue his { disfmarker } `` Grad G : Wrong , yeah . Professor E : And { disfmarker } and uh I got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that { disfmarker } that you looked at that { disfmarker } that it 's plausible at least . Postdoc B : It 's possible . Uh , he was { disfmarker } he { disfmarker } he { disfmarker } you know { disfmarker } We met and he was gon na go and uh you know , y look through them more systematically Professor E : Yeah . Postdoc B : and then uh meet again . Professor E : Yeah . Postdoc B : So it 's , you know , not a matter of a { disfmarker } Professor E : Yeah . Postdoc B : But , yeah , I think { disfmarker } I think it was optimistic . Professor E : So anyway , that 's { disfmarker } that 's e a quite different thing from anything we 've talked about that , you know , might { disfmarker } might { disfmarker } might come out from some of this . PhD C : But he can use text , basically . I mean , he 's talking about just using text Postdoc B : That 's his major { disfmarker } I mentioned several that w had to do with implications drawn from intonational contours PhD C : pretty much , or { disfmarker } ? Postdoc B : and { pause } that was n't as directly relevant to what he 's doing . He 's interested in these { disfmarker } these knowledge structures , PhD C : OK . PhD D : Yeah , interesting . Postdoc B : inferences that you draw { pause } i from { disfmarker } Professor E : I mean , he certainly could use text , but we were in fact looking to see if there { disfmarker } is there { disfmarker } is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } in this stuff . So . Grad G : And I imagine that transcripts of speech { disfmarker } I mean text that is speech { disfmarker } probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing . I { disfmarker } I do n't know whether it would or not , but it seems like it would . Professor E : I do n't know , probably de probably depends on what the prepared writing was . But . Postdoc B : Yeah , I do n't think I would make that leap , because i in narratives , you know { disfmarker } I mean , if you spell out everything in a narrative , it can be really tedious , Grad G : Mm - hmm . Postdoc B : so . Grad G : Yeah , I 'm just thinking , you know , when you 're { disfmarker } when you 're face to face , you have a lot of backchannel and { disfmarker } And { disfmarker } Postdoc B : Oh . That aspect . Grad G : Yeah . And so I think it 's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it 's face to face . I mean , so , if I just read that Dan was saying `` we 're ahead of the game `` { comment } in that { disfmarker } in that context , Postdoc B : Well { disfmarker } Yeah . Grad G : I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else . Postdoc B : I { disfmarker } you know , I { disfmarker } I had several that had to do with backchannels and this was n't one of them . Grad G : Uh - huh . Postdoc B : This { disfmarker } this one really does um m make you leap from { disfmarker } So he said , you know , `` we 're ahead of the game , w we have built - in downsampling `` . Grad G : Mm - hmm . Postdoc B : And the inference , i if you had it written down , would be { disfmarker } Grad G : I guess it would be the same . Postdoc B : Uh - huh . But there are others that have backchannelling , it 's just he was less interested in those . PhD F : Can I { disfmarker } Sorry to interrupt . Um , I f f f I 've { disfmarker } @ @ { comment } d A minute { disfmarker } uh , several minutes ago , I , like , briefly was { disfmarker } was not listening and { disfmarker } So who is `` he `` in this context ? PhD C : Yeah , there 's a lot of pronoun { disfmarker } PhD F : OK . So I was just realizing we 've { disfmarker } You guys have been talking about `` he `` um for at least uh , I do n't know , three { disfmarker } three four minutes without ever mentioning the person 's name again . PhD C : I believe it . Yeah . Actually to make it worse , { comment } uh , Morgan uses `` you `` and `` you `` PhD F : So this is { disfmarker } this is { disfmarker } this is { disfmarker } gon na be a big , big problem if you want to later do uh , you know , indexing , or speech understanding of any sort . Grad G : It 's in my notes . PhD C : with gaze and no identification , or { disfmarker } I just wrote this down . Yeah , actually . Cuz Morgan will say well , `` you had some ideas `` PhD D : Yeah . PhD F : You just wrote this ? PhD C : and he never said Li - He looked { disfmarker } Grad G : Well , I think he 's doing that intentionally , PhD C : Right , so it 's great . Grad G : are n't you ? PhD C : So this is really great PhD F : Right . PhD C : because the thing is , because he 's looking at the per even for addressees in the conversation , PhD D : Yeah . PhD F : Mm - hmm . PhD C : I bet you could pick that up in the acoustics . Just because your gaze is also correlated with the directionality of your voice . Professor E : Uh - huh . Could be . Postdoc B : Can we Professor E : Yeah . That would be tou Grad G : Oh , that would be interesting . PhD C : Yeah , so that , I mean , to even know um when { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah . PhD C : Yeah , if you have the P Z Ms you should be able to pick up what a person is looking at from their voice . Grad G : Well , especially with Morgan , with the way we have the microphones arranged . I 'm sort of right on axis and it would be very hard to tell . PhD C : Right . Grad G : Uh . Postdoc B : Oh , but you 'd have the { disfmarker } PhD C : Put Morgan always like this Postdoc B : You 'd have fainter { disfmarker } PhD C : and { disfmarker } Postdoc B : Would n't you get fainter reception out here ? Professor E : Well , these { disfmarker } Grad G : Sure , but I think if I 'm talking like this ? Right now I 'm looking at Jane and talking , now I 'm looking at Chuck and talking , I do n't think the microphones would pick up that difference . PhD C : But you do n't have this { disfmarker } this problem . Postdoc B : I see . PhD C : Morgan is the one who does this most . Grad G : So if I 'm talking at you , or I 'm talking at you . Professor E : I probably been affect No , I th I think I 've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about { disfmarker } and concerns about `` oh gee is somebody going to say something bad ? `` and so on . Grad G : Lawyers . Professor E : And so I { disfmarker } so I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm tending to stay away from people 's names even though uh { disfmarker } Postdoc B : I am too . PhD C : Even though you could pick up later on , just from the acoustics who you were t who you were looking at . Postdoc B : I am too . Grad G : And we did mention who `` he `` was . PhD C : Yeah . Professor E : Yeah . PhD F : Right , but I missed it . Grad G : Early in the conversation . PhD F : But { disfmarker } it was uh { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah , yeah . Professor E : Yeah . Grad G : Do { disfmarker } Sh - Can I say Professor E : Yeah . No no , there 's { disfmarker } PhD F : Yeah . Grad G : or { disfmarker } or is that just too sensitive ? Professor E : No no , it is n't sensitive at all . Postdoc B : Well { disfmarker } Professor E : I was just { disfmarker } I was just { disfmarker } I was overreacting just because we 've been talking about it . Postdoc B : And in fact , it is { disfmarker } it is { disfmarker } it is sensitive . PhD C : No , but that { disfmarker } it 's interesting . Professor E : It 's OK to { disfmarker } Postdoc B : I { disfmarker } I came up with something from the Human Subjects people that I wanted to mention . I mean , it fits into the m area of the mundane , but they did say { disfmarker } You know , I asked her very specifically about this clause of how , um , you know , it says `` no individuals will be identified uh , `` in any publication using the data . `` OK , well , individuals being identified , let 's say you have a { disfmarker } a snippet that says , `` Joe s uh thinks such - and - such about { disfmarker } about this field , but I think he 's wrongheaded . `` Now I mean , we 're { disfmarker } we 're gon na be careful not to have the `` wrongheaded `` part in there , but { disfmarker } but you know , let 's say we say , you know , `` Joe used to think so - and - so about this area , in his publication he says that but I think he 's changed his mind . `` or whatever . Then the issue of { disfmarker } of being able to trace Joe , because we know he 's well - known in this field , and all this and { disfmarker } and tie it to the speaker , whose name was just mentioned a moment ago , can be sensitive . Professor E : b But I { disfmarker } Postdoc B : So I think it 's really { disfmarker } really kind of adaptive and wise to not mention names any more than we have to because if there 's a slanderous aspect to it , then how much to we wan na be able to have to remove ? Professor E : Yeah , well , there 's that . But I { disfmarker } I mean I think also to some extent it 's just educating the Human Subjects people , in a way , because there 's { disfmarker } If uh { disfmarker } You know , there 's court transcripts , there 's { disfmarker } there 's transcripts of radio shows { disfmarker } I mean people say people 's names all the time . So I think it { disfmarker } it ca n't be bad to say people 's names . It 's just that { disfmarker } i I mean you 're right that there 's more poten If we never say anybody 's name , then there 's no chance of { disfmarker } of { disfmarker } of slandering anybody , PhD C : But , then it wo n't { disfmarker } I mean , if we { disfmarker } if we { disfmarker } Professor E : but { disfmarker } Grad G : It 's not a meeting . PhD C : Yeah . I mean we should do whatever 's natural in a meeting if { disfmarker } if we were n't being recorded . Professor E : Yeah . Right , so I { disfmarker } So my behavior is probably not natural . PhD C : `` If Person X { disfmarker } `` Professor E : So . Postdoc B : Well , my feeling on it was that it was n't really important who said it , you know . Professor E : Yeah . PhD F : Well , if you ha since you have to um go over the transcripts later anyway , you could make it one of the jobs of the { pause } people who do that to mark Grad G : Well , we t we t we talked about this during the anon anonymization . PhD F : Right . Grad G : If we wan na go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone says a name . And I thought that our conclusion was that we did n't want to do that . Professor E : Yeah , we really ca n't . But a actually , I 'm sorry . I really would like to push { disfmarker } finish this off . Postdoc B : I understand . No I just { disfmarker } I just was suggesting that it 's not a bad policy p potentially . Professor E : So it 's { disfmarker } Postdoc B : So , we need to talk about this later . Professor E : Yeah , I di I did n't intend it an a policy though . Postdoc B : Uh - huh . Professor E : It was { disfmarker } it was just it was just unconscious { disfmarker } well , semi - conscious behavior . I sorta knew I was doing it but it was { disfmarker } PhD F : Well , I still do n't know who `` he `` is . Professor E : I { disfmarker } I do I do n't remember who `` he `` is . PhD C : No , you have to say , you still do n't know who `` he `` is , with that prosody . Professor E : Ah . Uh , we were talking about Dan at one point { comment } and we were talking about Lokendra at another point . Postdoc B : Yeah , depends on which one you mean . Professor E : And I do n't { disfmarker } I do n't remember which { disfmarker } which part . PhD F : Oh . PhD C : It 's ambiguous , so it 's OK . Professor E : Uh , I think { disfmarker } Grad G : Well , the inference structures was Lokendra . PhD F : But no . The inference stuff was { disfmarker } was { disfmarker } was Lokendra . Professor E : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . PhD F : OK . That makes sense , yeah . PhD C : And the downsampling must have been Dan . Professor E : Um { disfmarker } Grad G : Yeah . Professor E : Good { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD C : It 's an inference . Professor E : Yeah , you could do all these inferences , yeah . Grad G : Yeah . Professor E : Yeah . Um , I { disfmarker } I would like to move it into { disfmarker } into uh what Jose uh has been doing Postdoc B : Yeah . Professor E : because he 's actually been doing something . PhD D : Uh - huh . OK . Professor E : So . { vocalsound } Right . PhD F : As opposed to the rest of us . PhD D : Well - { comment } { vocalsound } OK . I { disfmarker } I remind that me { disfmarker } my first objective eh , in the project is to { disfmarker } to study difference parameters to { disfmarker } to find a { disfmarker } a good solution to detect eh , the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded . But eh , { vocalsound } tsk , { comment } { vocalsound } ehhh { comment } In that way { comment } I { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I begin to { disfmarker } to study and to analyze the ehn { disfmarker } the recorded speech eh the different session to { disfmarker } to find and to locate and to mark eh the { disfmarker } the different overlapping zone . And eh so eh I was eh { disfmarker } I am transcribing the { disfmarker } the first session and I { disfmarker } I have found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events , eh besides the overlapping zones , eh I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh , eh , talk eh , eh , clap , eh { disfmarker } { comment } I do n't know what is the different names eh you use to { disfmarker } to name the { disfmarker } the { pause } n speech PhD A : Nonspeech sounds ? PhD D : Yeah . Grad G : Oh , I do n't think we 've been doing it at that level of detail . So . PhD D : Yeah . Eh , { vocalsound } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I do I do n't need to { disfmarker } to { disfmarker } to mmm { vocalsound } { disfmarker } to m to label the { disfmarker } the different acoustic , but I prefer because eh I would like to { disfmarker } to study if eh , I { disfmarker } I will find eh , eh , a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to { disfmarker } to { disfmarker } to test these parameters eh with the { disfmarker } another eh , eh acoustic events , to nnn { disfmarker } { vocalsound } to eh { disfmarker } to find what is the ehm { disfmarker } the false { disfmarker } eh , the false eh hypothesis eh , nnn , which eh are produced when we use the { disfmarker } the ehm { disfmarker } this eh parameter { disfmarker } eh I mean pitch eh , eh , difference eh , feature { disfmarker } Grad G : Mm - hmm . PhD A : You know { disfmarker } I think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there 's two there . Grad G : So it was { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah . PhD A : I mean , if it 's a tapping sound , you would n't necessarily { disfmarker } or , you know , something like that , it 'd be { disfmarker } it might be hard to know that it was two separate events . PhD D : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Grad G : Well { disfmarker } You were n't talking about just overlaps PhD D : Ye Grad G : were you ? You were just talking about acoustic events . PhD D : I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general , Grad G : Someone starts , someone stops { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD A : Oh . PhD D : but eh my { disfmarker } my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone . Grad G : Mm - hmm . PhD D : Eh ? { comment } n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events . Professor E : How many overlaps were there uh in it ? No no , how many of them were the overlaps of speech , though ? PhD D : How many ? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session Grad G : Oh , God ! PhD D : in five { disfmarker } eh in forty - five minutes . PhD A : Three hundred overlapping speech { disfmarker } PhD D : Alm - Three hundred overlapping zone . Grad G : Ugh . PhD C : Overlapping speech . PhD D : With the overlapping zone , overlapping speech { disfmarker } speech what eh different duration . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor E : Sure . Postdoc B : Does this { disfmarker } ? So if you had an overlap involving three people , how many times was that counted ? PhD D : Yeah , three people , two people . Eh , um I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background , be Professor E : No no , but I think what she 's asking is { pause } if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking , instead of two , did you call that one event ? PhD D : Oh . Oh . Yeah . I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone . This { disfmarker } th I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I con I consider { disfmarker } I consider eh an acoustic event , the overlapping zone , the period where three speaker or eh { disfmarker } are talking together . Grad G : Well { disfmarker } So let 's { disfmarker } Postdoc B : For Grad G : So let 's say me and Jane are talking at the same time , and then Liz starts talking also over all of us . How many events would that be ? PhD D : So - I do n't understand . Grad G : So , two people are talking , { comment } and then a third person starts talking . PhD D : Yeah ? Grad G : Is there an event right here ? PhD D : Eh no . No no . For me is the overlapping zone , because { disfmarker } because you { disfmarker } you have s you have more one { disfmarker } eh , more one voice eh , eh produced in a { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } in a moment . Professor E : I see . Grad G : So i if two or more people are talking . Professor E : OK . Yeah . So I think { disfmarker } Yeah . We just wanted to understand how you 're defining it . PhD D : Yeah . If Professor E : So then , in the region between { disfmarker } since there { disfmarker } there is some continuous region , in between regions where there is only one person speaking . PhD D : Uh - huh . Professor E : And one contiguous region like that you 're calling an event . PhD D : Uh - huh . Professor E : Is it { disfmarker } Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event , PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : or are you calling the entire length of it the event ? PhD D : I consider the { disfmarker } the , nnn { disfmarker } the nnn , nnn { disfmarker } eh , the entirety eh , eh , all { disfmarker } all the time there were { disfmarker } the voice has overlapped . Professor E : OK . PhD D : This is the idea . But eh I { disfmarker } I do n't distinguish between the { disfmarker } the numbers of eh speaker . Uh , I 'm not considering { vocalsound } eh the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } ehm { vocalsound } eh , the fact of eh , eh , for example , what did you say ? Eh at first eh , eh two talkers are uh , eh speaking , and eh , eh a third person eh join to { disfmarker } to that . For me , it 's eh { disfmarker } it 's eh , all overlap zone , with eh several numbers of speakers is eh , eh the same acoustic event . Wi - but { disfmarker } uh , without any mark between the zone { disfmarker } of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together , and the zone with the three speakers . Postdoc B : That would j just be one . PhD D : It { disfmarker } One . One . Postdoc B : OK . PhD D : Eh , with eh , a beginning mark and the ending mark . Because eh { vocalsound } for me , is the { disfmarker } is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral . Professor E : Got it . PhD D : I do n't mind { disfmarker } By the moment , by the moment . Grad G : Well , but { disfmarker } But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two . PhD D : I { disfmarker } I do n't { disfmarker } Yeah , but eh { disfmarker } but eh I have to study . { comment } What will happen in a general way , Professor E : Could . Grad G : So . You had to start somewhere . Professor E : Yeah . We just w PhD C : So there 's a lot of overlap . PhD D : I { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I do n't know what eh will { disfmarker } will happen with the { disfmarker } Grad G : Yep . PhD C : So . Grad G : That 's a lot of overlap , PhD D : Yeah ? Professor E : So again , that 's { disfmarker } that 's three { disfmarker } three hundred in forty - five minutes that are { disfmarker } that are speakers , just speakers . Grad G : yeah , for forty - five minutes . PhD D : Yeah . Yeah . Professor E : Uh - huh . OK . Yeah . Postdoc B : But a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a th Professor E : So that 's about eight per minute . Postdoc B : But a thousand events in twelve minutes , that 's { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah , { pause } but { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD C : But that can include taps . PhD D : But { disfmarker } Professor E : Uh . Yeah . Postdoc B : Well , but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot . PhD D : General . PhD C : Actually { disfmarker } PhD D : I { disfmarker } I con I consider { disfmarker } I consider acoustic events eh , the silent too . Postdoc B : Silent . Grad G : Silence starting or silence ending { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah , silent , ground to { disfmarker } bec to detect { disfmarker } eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech . PhD C : Oh , OK . Professor E : Mm - hmm . PhD A : Oh . PhD D : In ge in { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } in a general point of view . PhD C : Oh . Professor E : OK , so how many of those thousand were silence ? PhD C : Alright . PhD D : in the per PhD F : Not speech { disfmarker } not speech or too much speech . PhD D : Too much speech . Professor E : Right . So how many of those thousand were silence , silent sections ? PhD D : Yeah . Uh silent , I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I do n't { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I have n't the { disfmarker } eh I { disfmarker } I would like to { disfmarker } to do a stylistic study Professor E : Yeah . PhD D : and give you eh with the report eh from eh the { disfmarker } the study from the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the session { disfmarker } one session . Professor E : Yeah . Yeah . PhD D : And I { disfmarker } I found that eh another thing . When eh { vocalsound } eh I w I { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I was eh look at eh nnn , the difference speech file , um , for example , eh if eh we use the ehm { disfmarker } the mixed file , to { disfmarker } to transcribe , the { disfmarker } the events and the words , I { disfmarker } I saw that eh the eh speech signal , collected by the eh this kind of mike { disfmarker } eh of this kind of mike , eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh , we eh { disfmarker } collected by headphone . Grad G : Yep . PhD D : And { disfmarker } It 's right . Professor E : Yeah . Grad G : Right . PhD D : But the problem is { vocalsound } the following . The { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I knew that eh the signal eh , eh would be different , but eh the { disfmarker } the problem is eh , eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by { disfmarker } by that mike uh qui compared with the mixed file . And so if { disfmarker } when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn { disfmarker } the mixed file , it 's possible { disfmarker } eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system , it 's possible you eh { disfmarker } in the eh i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike , to eh { disfmarker } to nnn { disfmarker } to do the experiments { pause } with the { disfmarker } the system , Professor E : Mm - hmm . Grad G : Right . PhD D : its possible to evaluate eh , eh { disfmarker } or to consider eh acoustic events that { disfmarker } which you marked eh in the mixed file , but eh they do n't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the { disfmarker } by the mike . Grad G : Right . The { disfmarker } the reason that I generated the mixed file was for IBM to do word level transcription , not speech event transcription . PhD D : Yeah . Yeah . Oh , it 's a good idea . It 's a good idea I think . Grad G : So I agree that if someone wants to do speech event transcription , that the mixed signals here { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah . Grad G : I mean , if I 'm tapping on the table , you it 's not gon na show up on any of the mikes , but it 's gon na show up rather loudly in the PZM . PhD D : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So and I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I say eh that eh , eh , or this eh only because eh I c I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } { vocalsound } in my opinion , it 's necessary to eh { disfmarker } to eh { disfmarker } to put the transcription on the speech file , collected by the objective signal . Grad G : So . PhD D : I mean the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the signal collected by the { disfmarker } eh , the real mike in the future , in the prototype to { disfmarker } to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech Professor E : Mm - hmm . The { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the far - field , yeah . PhD D : you have to { disfmarker } to analyze { disfmarker } you have to { disfmarker } to process . Because I { disfmarker } I found a difference . Professor E : Yeah , well , just { disfmarker } I mean , just in that { disfmarker } that one s ten second , or whatever it was , example that Adam had that { disfmarker } that we { disfmarker } we passed on to others a few months ago , there was that business where I g I guess it was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time and { disfmarker } and uh , in the close - talking mikes you could n't hear the overlap , and in the distant mike you could . So yeah , it 's clear that if you wan na study { disfmarker } if you wan na find all the places where there were overlap , it 's probably better to use a distant mike . PhD F : That 's good . Professor E : On the other hand , there 's other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close - talking mikes , PhD D : Yeah . PhD C : But why ca n't you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , time aligned ? Professor E : so it 's { disfmarker } Grad G : If you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , you would hear Jane interrupting me , but you would n't hear the paper rustling . And so if you 're interested in { disfmarker } PhD C : I { disfmarker } I mean if you 're interested in speakers overlapping other speakers and not the other kinds of nonspeech , that 's not a problem , Professor E : Some { comment } of it 's masking { disfmarker } masked . PhD D : Yeah . PhD A : Were you interrupting him or was he interrupting you ? Professor E : Right . PhD C : right ? Grad G : Right . PhD D : Yeah . Grad G : Although the other issue is that the { pause } mixed close - talking mikes { disfmarker } I mean , I 'm doing weird normalizations and things like that . PhD C : But it 's known . PhD D : Yeah . PhD C : I mean , the normalization you do is over the whole conversation Grad G : Yep . PhD C : is n't it , over the whole meeting . Grad G : Right . Yep . PhD C : So if you wanted to study people overlapping people , that 's not a problem . PhD D : I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I think eh I saw the nnn { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } eh but eh I eh { disfmarker } I have eh any results . I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I saw the { disfmarker } the speech file collected by eh the fet mike , and eh eh signal eh to eh { disfmarker } to noise eh relation is eh low . It 's low . Professor E : Mm - hmm . PhD D : It 's very low . You would comp if we compare it with eh the headphone . Grad G : Yep . PhD D : And I { disfmarker } I found that nnn { disfmarker } that eh , { vocalsound } ehm , pr probably , Grad G : Did { disfmarker } Did you PhD D : I 'm not sure eh by the moment , but it 's { disfmarker } it 's probably that eh a lot of eh , { vocalsound } eh for example , in the overlapping zone , on eh { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } in several eh parts of the files where you { disfmarker } you can find eh , eh { vocalsound } eh , smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the { disfmarker } in the meeting , Professor E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD D : it 's probably in { disfmarker } in that eh { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } in those files you { disfmarker } you can not find { disfmarker } you can not process because eh it 's confused with { disfmarker } with noise . Professor E : Mm - hmm . PhD D : And there are { vocalsound } a lot of I think . But I have to study with more detail . But eh my idea is to { disfmarker } to process only { pause } nnn , this eh { disfmarker } nnn , this kind of s of eh speech . Because I think it 's more realistic . I 'm not sure it 's a good idea , but eh { disfmarker } Professor E : No { disfmarker } i Grad G : Well , it 's more realistic but it 'll { disfmarker } it 'll be a lot harder . PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : Well , it 'd be hard , but on the other hand as you point out , if your { disfmarker } if i if { disfmarker } if your concern is to get uh the overlapping people { disfmarker } people 's speech , you will { disfmarker } you will get that somewhat better . PhD D : Mm - hmm . Yeah . Professor E : Um , Are you making any use { disfmarker } uh you were { disfmarker } you were working with th the data that had already been transcribed . PhD D : With { disfmarker } By Jane . Professor E : Does it uh { disfmarker } Yes . PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : Now um did you make any use of that ? See I was wondering cuz we st we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed . PhD D : Yeah . Yeah . Professor E : Do you { disfmarker } PhD D : The { disfmarker } the transcription by Jane , t eh i eh , I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I want to use to { disfmarker } to nnn , { vocalsound } eh to put { disfmarker } i i it 's a reference for me . But eh the transcription { disfmarker } eh for example , I { disfmarker } I do n't { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I 'm not interested in the { disfmarker } in the { disfmarker } in the words , transcription words , eh transcribed eh eh in { disfmarker } eh follow in the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } in the { disfmarker } in the speech file , but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker , in the { disfmarker } in the meeting , um eh she { disfmarker } she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh { disfmarker } there is an overlapping zone . But eh there is n't any { disfmarker } any mark , time { disfmarker } temporal mark , to { disfmarker } to c eh { disfmarker } to mmm { vocalsound } { disfmarker } e - heh , to label { comment } the beginning and the end of the { disfmarker } of the Professor E : Mm - hmm . OK . Right , so she is { disfmarker } PhD D : ta I 'm { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I think eh we need this information to Professor E : Right . So the twelve { disfmarker } you { disfmarker } you { disfmarker } it took you twelve hours { disfmarker } of course this included maybe some { disfmarker } some time where you were learning about what { disfmarker } what you wanted to do , but { disfmarker } but uh , it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty - five minutes , your Grad G : Twelve minutes . PhD D : Twelve minutes . Professor E : s Twelve minutes ! PhD D : Twelve minutes . Twelve . Professor E : I thought you did forty - five minutes of { disfmarker } PhD D : No , forty - five minutes is the { disfmarker } is the session , all the session . Postdoc B : Oh . Professor E : Oh , you have n't done the whole session . PhD D : Yeah , all is the { vocalsound } the session . Professor E : This is just twelve minutes . PhD D : Tw - twelve hours of work to { disfmarker } { vocalsound } to segment eh and label eh twelve minutes from a session of part { disfmarker } of f Professor E : Oh . So { comment } let me back up again . So the { disfmarker } when you said there were three hundred speaker overlaps , PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : that 's in twelve minutes ? PhD D : No no no . I { disfmarker } I consider all the { disfmarker } all the session because eh I { disfmarker } I count the nnn { disfmarker } the nnn { disfmarker } the overlappings marked by { disfmarker } by Jane , Professor E : Oh , OK . Postdoc B : Oh , I see . PhD D : in { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } in the { pause } fin in { disfmarker } in the { pause } forty - five minutes . Professor E : OK . So it 's three hundred in forty - five minutes , but you have { disfmarker } you have time uh , uh marked { disfmarker } twelve minute { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it . PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : Got it . PhD F : So , can I ask { disfmarker } { vocalsound } can I ask whether you found { disfmarker } uh , you know , how accurate uh Jane 's uh uh labels were as far as { disfmarker } Grad G : Well , not just the overlaps , everything . PhD F : you know , did she miss some overlaps ? or did she n ? PhD D : But , by { disfmarker } by the moment , I { disfmarker } I do n't compare , my { disfmarker } my temporal mark with eh Jane , but eh I { disfmarker } I want to do it . Because eh eh i per perhaps I have eh errors in the { disfmarker } in the marks , I { disfmarker } and if I { disfmarker } I compare with eh Jane , it 's probably I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I can correct and { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file . Professor E : Yeah . Grad G : Well , also Jane { disfmarker } Jane was doing word level . PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : Yeah . Grad G : So we were n't concerned with { comment } exactly when an overlap started and stopped . PhD F : Right . Right . PhD C : Well , not only a word level , but actually PhD D : Well { disfmarker } PhD F : I 'm expect I 'm not expecting { disfmarker } PhD D : No , it 's { disfmarker } PhD C : I mean , you did n't need to show the exact point of interruption , you just were showing at the level of the phrase or the level of the speech spurt , or { disfmarker } Grad G : Right . Professor E : Mm - hmm . Grad G : Yep . Postdoc B : Well { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah . Yeah . Postdoc B : Well , yeah , b yeah , I would say time bin . So my { disfmarker } my goal is to get words with reference to a time bin , { pause } beginning and end point . PhD C : Yeah . PhD D : Yeah . PhD C : Right . PhD D : Yeah . Postdoc B : And { disfmarker } and sometimes , you know , it was like you could have an overlap where someone said something in the middle , PhD D : Yeah . Postdoc B : but , yeah , w it just was n't important for our purposes to have it that { disfmarker } i disrupt that unit in order to have , you know , a the words in the order in which they were spoken , it would have { disfmarker } it would have been hard with the interface that we have . PhD D : Yeah . Postdoc B : Now , my { disfmarker } a Adam 's working on a of course , on a revised overlapping interface , PhD D : Uh - huh . Grad G : Right . PhD D : I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I think { disfmarker } It 's { disfmarker } it 's a good eh work , Postdoc B : but { disfmarker } PhD D : but eh I think we need eh eh more information . PhD F : No , of course . Postdoc B : Yeah . PhD F : I expect you to find more overlaps than { disfmarker } than Jane Grad G : Always need more for { disfmarker } Postdoc B : Yeah . PhD D : No , no . I { disfmarker } I have to go to { disfmarker } PhD F : because you 're looking at it at a much more detailed level . PhD D : I want eh { disfmarker } I wanted to eh compare the { disfmarker } the transcription . Professor E : I have { disfmarker } Grad G : But if it takes sixty to one { disfmarker } Professor E : Well , I but I have a suggestion about that . Um , obviously this is very , very time - consuming , and you 're finding lots of things which I 'm sure are gon na be very interesting , but in the interests of making progress , uh might I s how { disfmarker } how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps ? PhD D : Only . Professor E : Yes . PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : Do not mark any other events , PhD D : Uh - huh . Professor E : but only mark speaker { disfmarker } Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit ? PhD D : OK . OK . I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I w I { disfmarker } I wanted to { disfmarker } Professor E : Do y do you think that would speed it up ? Uh , speed up your { disfmarker } your { disfmarker } your marking ? PhD D : nnn , I do n't understand very . Professor E : It took you a long time { pause } to mark twelve minutes . PhD D : Yeah . Oh , yeah , yeah . Professor E : Now , my suggestion was for the other thirty - three { disfmarker } PhD D : On - only to mark { disfmarker } only to mark overlapping zone , but { disfmarker } Professor E : Yeah , and my question is , if you did that , if you followed my suggestion , would it take much less time ? PhD D : Oh , yeah . Sure . Professor E : Yeah OK . PhD D : Yeah sure . Professor E : Then I think it 's a good idea . PhD D : Sure sure . Professor E : Then I think it 's a good idea , because it PhD D : Sure , because I { disfmarker } I need a lot of time to { disfmarker } to put the label or to do that . Yeah . Professor E : Yeah , I mean , we we know that there 's noise . Grad G : And PhD D : Uh - huh . Professor E : There 's { disfmarker } there 's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth , and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : and { disfmarker } and something in between with paper rustling . We know that all that 's there and it 's a g worthwhile thing to study , but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things . PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : Whereas th i I would think that uh you { disfmarker } we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking . PhD D : Uh - huh . OK . OK . Professor E : So . Then you can get the { disfmarker } Cuz you need { disfmarker } If it 's three hundred uh { disfmarker } i i it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : And { disfmarker } and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of { disfmarker } of what 's going on , much less any kind of reasonable statistics . Grad G : Right . PhD C : Now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the { disfmarker } Grad G : Well , that 's { disfmarker } That 's what I was gon na bring up . PhD C : I mean , you should n't need to do this p completely by hand , Professor E : Um , OK , yeah . So let 's back up because you were n't here for an earlier conversation . PhD C : right ? I 'm sorry . Professor E : So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy , such as the energy in the LPC residuals , such as { disfmarker } I mean there 's a bunch of things { disfmarker } I mean , increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one . PhD C : Mm - hmm . In the far - field mike . Professor E : Yeah . PhD C : Oh , OK . Professor E : Um , and uh , it 's not obvious , I mean , you could { disfmarker } you could do the dumbest thing and get { disfmarker } get it ninety percent of the time . But when you start going past that and trying to do better , it 's not obvious what combination of features is gon na give you the { disfmarker } you know , the right detector . So the idea is to have some ground truth first . And so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say `` OK this , i you know , it 's { disfmarker } it 's really here `` . PhD A : But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts ? PhD C : What I mean is { pause } get it from the close - talking mikes . Professor E : Uh , yeah . PhD C : A or ge get a first pass from those , Professor E : We t we t w we t we talked about that . PhD C : and then go through sort of { disfmarker } It 'd be a lot faster probably to { disfmarker } PhD F : And you can { disfmarker } Grad G : Yeah , that 's his , uh { disfmarker } Professor E : We { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } we talked about that . s But so it 's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is , PhD C : Yeah , I just { disfmarker } Professor E : the idea was , i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway , and { disfmarker } and then whatever he could mark would be helpful , PhD C : Right . Professor E : and we could { disfmarker } Uh it 's a question of what you bootstrap from . You know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better , or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then { disfmarker } then do your simple measurements , uh from the close - talking mike . I mean , even with the close - talking mike you 're not gon na get it right all the time . PhD C : Well , that 's what I wonder , because um { disfmarker } or how bad it is , Professor E : Well PhD C : be um , because that would be interesting Grad G : I 'm working on a program to do that , and { disfmarker } PhD C : especially because the bottleneck is the transcription . Right ? I mean , we 've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for . We have the audio data , we have the close - talking mike , Professor E : Yeah . PhD C : so I mean it seems like one kind of project that 's not perfect , but { disfmarker } um , that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is , you know , if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech , Professor E : Right , we discussed that . PhD C : you know , how can we detect that from a far - field ? Grad G : And { disfmarker } Postdoc B : Oh . Grad G : I 've { disfmarker } I 've written a program to do that , PhD C : OK , I 'm sorry I missed the { disfmarker } Grad G : and it , uh { disfmarker } Professor E : It 's OK . Grad G : and { disfmarker } so { disfmarker } but it 's { disfmarker } it 's doing something very , very simple . It just takes a threshold , based on { disfmarker } on the volume , PhD C : Uh - huh . PhD F : Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand . PhD C : Right , by hand . Yeah . PhD F : Yeah . Grad G : um , and then it does a median filter , and then it looks for runs . And , it seems to work , I 've { disfmarker } I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters , to get it to actually generate something , and I have n't { disfmarker } I do n't { disfmarker } what I 'm working on { disfmarker } was working on { disfmarker } was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have , { pause } into Transcriber . And so { disfmarker } I told { disfmarker } I said it would take about a day . I 've worked on it for about half a day , Grad H : I have to go . Grad G : so give me another half day and I we 'll have something we can play with . PhD C : OK . Professor E : See , this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working , because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this , and I 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided , PhD C : Right . I 'm sorry . I just { disfmarker } Professor E : but I could n't remember all of it . PhD C : It Professor E : So , I think it was partly that , you know , give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like , partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against , you know , when { disfmarker } when he { disfmarker } he gets his thing going , Grad G : But { disfmarker } Professor E : uh , and { disfmarker } PhD C : Well , it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it . I was just thinking as a way to speed up you know , the amount of { disfmarker } Postdoc B : Mm - hmm . Professor E : That was { disfmarker } that was exactly the notion that { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } that we discussed . PhD C : OK . Grad G : Thanks . Postdoc B : Another thing we discussed was um that { disfmarker } PhD C : It looks good . Professor E : So . PhD C : I 'll be in touch . Thanks . Professor E : S See ya . Yeah . Postdoc B : Was that um there m { pause } there was this already a script I believe uh that Dan had written , { comment } that uh handle bleedthrough , I mean cuz you have this { disfmarker } this close { disfmarker } you have contamination from other people who speak loudly . Grad G : Yeah , and I have n't tried using that . It would probably help the program that I 'm doing to first feed it through that . It 's a cross - correlation filter . So I { disfmarker } I have n't tried that , but that { disfmarker } If { disfmarker } It { disfmarker } it might be something { disfmarker } it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little . Postdoc B : So , some thought of maybe having { disfmarker } Yeah , having that be a preprocessor and then run it through yours . Grad G : Exactly . Yep . Professor E : But { disfmarker } but that 's a refinement Postdoc B : That 's what we were discussing . Professor E : and I think we wan na see { disfmarker } try the simple thing first , cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good y y yo you sort of wan na see what the simple thing does first . Grad G : Yep . Professor E : But uh , having { disfmarker } having somebody have some experience , again , with { disfmarker } with uh { disfmarker } with marking it from a human standpoint , we 're { disfmarker } I mean , I do n't expect Jose to { disfmarker } to do it for uh f fifty hours of { disfmarker } { comment } of speech , but I mean we { disfmarker } { comment } if uh { disfmarker } if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it , say , for forty - five minutes , then at least we 'd have three hundred examples of it . PhD D : Yeah . Sure . Sure . Professor E : And when { disfmarker } when uh Adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different . PhD C : Oh yeah , definitely . PhD A : You know , I did { disfmarker } I did uh something almost identical to this at one of my previous jobs , and it works pretty well . I mean , i almost exactly what you described , an energy detector with a median filter , you look for runs . And uh , you know , you can { disfmarker } Grad G : It seemed like the right thing to do . PhD A : Yeah . I mean , you { disfmarker } you can get y I mean , you get them pretty close . Grad G : That was with zero literature search . PhD A : And so I think doing that to generate these possibilities and then going through and saying yes or no on them would be a quick way to { disfmarker } to do it . Grad G : That 's good validation . PhD A : Yeah . Postdoc B : Is this proprietary ? PhD A : Uh . { comment } No . No . Grad G : Yeah , do you have a patent on it ? PhD A : It was when I was working for the government . Professor E : Oh , then everybody owns it . It 's the people . Postdoc B : Well , I mean , is this something that we could just co - opt , or is it { disfmarker } ? PhD A : Nah . Postdoc B : No . OK . Professor E : Well , i i i he 's pretty close , anyway . I think { disfmarker } I think it 's { disfmarker } PhD A : Yeah , he 's { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } it does n't take a long time . Postdoc B : Right . I just thought if it was tried and true , then { disfmarker } { comment } and he 's gone through additional levels of { disfmarker } of development . Grad G : Just output . Although if you { disfmarker } if you have some parameters like what 's a good window size for the median filter { disfmarker } PhD A : Oh ! { comment } I have to remember . I 'll think about it , and try to remember . PhD F : And it might be different for government people . Grad G : That 's alright . Professor E : Yeah , good enough for government work , as they say . PhD C : They { disfmarker } they { disfmarker } PhD A : Di - dif different { disfmarker } different bandwidth . PhD F : They Grad G : I was doing pretty short , you know , tenth of a second , { comment } sorts of numbers . PhD F : OK . Professor E : Uh , I do n't know , it { disfmarker } if { disfmarker } if we want to uh { disfmarker } So , uh , maybe we should move on to other { disfmarker } other things in limited time . Postdoc B : Can I ask one question about his statistics ? So { disfmarker } so in the tw twelve minutes , um , if we took three hundred and divided it by four , which is about the length of twelve minutes , i Um , I 'd expect like there should be seventy - five overlaps . Professor E : Yeah . Postdoc B : Did you find uh more than seventy - five overlaps in that period , or { disfmarker } ? PhD D : More than ? Postdoc B : More than { disfmarker } How many overlaps in your twelve minutes ? PhD D : How many ? Eh , not @ @ I Onl - only I { disfmarker } I transcribe eh only twelve minutes from the Professor E : Yeah . PhD D : but eh I { disfmarker } I do n't co eh { disfmarker } I do n't count eh the { disfmarker } the overlap . Postdoc B : The overlaps . OK . PhD D : I consider I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } The { disfmarker } the nnn { disfmarker } The { disfmarker } the three hundred is eh considered only you { disfmarker } your transcription . I have to { disfmarker } { vocalsound } to finish transcribing . So . Grad G : I b I bet they 're more , because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than { disfmarker } than sort of the middle . PhD D : Yeah . Grad G : Middle or end . Postdoc B : I 'm not sure . PhD D : Yeah . Grad G : Because i we 're { disfmarker } we 're dealing with the { disfmarker } Uh , in the early meetings , we 're recording while we 're saying who 's talking on what microphone , { comment } and things like that , PhD D : Yeah . Grad G : and that seems to be a lot of overlap . Postdoc B : I think it 's an empirical question . PhD D : Yeah . Postdoc B : I think we could find that out . PhD D : Yeah . Grad G : Yep . Postdoc B : I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm not sure that the beginning had more . Professor E : So { disfmarker } so I was gon na ask , I guess about any { disfmarker } any other things that { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } that either of you wanted to talk about , especially since Andreas is leaving in five minutes , that { disfmarker } that you wan na go with . PhD C : Can I just ask about the data , like very straightforward question is where we are on the amount of data and the amount of transcribed data , just cuz I 'm { disfmarker } I wanted to get a feel for that to sort of be able to know what { disfmarker } what can be done first and like how many meetings are we recording Professor E : Right so there 's this { disfmarker } this { disfmarker } There 's this forty - five minute piece that Jane transcribed . PhD C : and { disfmarker } Professor E : That piece was then uh sent to IBM so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point . Then there 's s a larger piece that 's been recorded and uh put on CD - ROM and sent uh to IBM . Right ? And then we do n't know . PhD C : How many meetings is that ? Like { disfmarker } how many { disfmarker } Grad G : What 's that ? Professor E : That was about ten hours , and there was about { disfmarker } PhD C : t ten { disfmarker } It 's like ten meetings or something ? Uh - huh . Grad G : Yeah , something like that . And then { disfmarker } then we PhD A : Ten meetings that have been sent to IBM ? PhD C : And { disfmarker } Professor E : Yeah . Grad G : Well , I have n't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the { pause } missing files . Professor E : Oh . Oh , that 's right , that had { disfmarker } those have not been sent . PhD A : H how many total have we recorded now , altogether ? Professor E : We 're saying about { pause } twelve hours . Grad G : About twelve { pause } by now . Twelve or thirteen . PhD C : Uh - huh . And we 're recording only this meeting , like continuously we 're only recording this one now ? or { disfmarker } ? Professor E : No . No , so the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } that 's the { disfmarker } that 's the biggest one { disfmarker } uh , chunk so far , Grad G : Nope . PhD A : It was the morning one . PhD C : OK . Professor E : but there 's at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guys . Grad G : Jerry . PhD C : Do they meet every week , Professor E : And then there { disfmarker } PhD C : or every { disfmarker } Professor E : Uh , they do . w w And we talked to them about recording some more and we 're going to , uh , we 've started having a morning meeting , today uh i starting a w a week or two ago , on the uh front - end issues , and we 're recording those , uh there 's a network services and applications group here who 's agreed to have their meetings recorded , PhD C : Great . Professor E : and we 're gon na start recording them . They 're { disfmarker } They meet on Tuesdays . We 're gon na start recording them next week . So actually , we 're gon na h start having a { disfmarker } a pretty significant chunk and so , you know , { vocalsound } Adam 's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy , and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff { disfmarker } things like that , now that uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } the things are starting to happen . So right now , yeah , I th I 'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings , but there are scattered other meetings in it and that { disfmarker } that amount is gon na grow uh so that the meeting meetings will probably ultimately { disfmarker } i if we 're { disfmarker } if we collect fifty or sixty hours , the meeting meetings it will probably be , you know , twenty or thirty percent of it , not { disfmarker } not { disfmarker } not eighty or ninety . But . PhD C : So there 's probably { disfmarker } there 's three to four a week , Grad G : That 's what we 're aiming for . PhD C : that we 're aiming for . Professor E : Yeah . PhD C : And they 're each about an hour or something . Professor E : Yeah , yeah . Grad G : Although { disfmarker } Yeah . We 'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not . PhD C : So { disfmarker } OK . Professor E : Yeah and th the { disfmarker } the other thing is I 'm not pos I 'm sort of thinking as we 've been through this a few times , that I really do n't know { disfmarker } maybe you wan na do it once for the novelty , but I do n't know if in general we wan na have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits . Grad G : Right . Professor E : Because it 's just an added bunch of weird stuff . PhD C : Yeah . Professor E : And , you know , we { disfmarker } we h we 're highly motivated . Uh in fact , the morning group is really motivated cuz they 're working on connected digits , so it 's { disfmarker } Grad G : Actually that 's something I wanted to ask , is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits . Professor E : Yeah . Grad G : We do n't have to hand - transcribe the digits because we 're reading them and I have those . PhD C : Right . Professor E : Yeah . Grad G : And so I have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance . But I have n't been ru I have n't been doing that . Um , if I did that , is someone gon na be working on it ? Professor E : Uh , yeah , I { disfmarker } I think definitely s so Absolutely . Grad G : I mean , is it something of interest ? Professor E : Yeah , whoever we have working on the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gon na start with that . Grad G : OK . I mean , I I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm interested in it , I just do n't have time to do it now . PhD F : I was { disfmarker } these meetings { disfmarker } I 'm sure someone thought of this , but these { disfmarker } this uh reading of the numbers would be extremely helpful to do um adaptation . Grad G : So PhD F : Um . Grad G : Yep . Yep . PhD C : Actually I have o Grad G : I { disfmarker } I would really like someone to do adaptation . PhD F : Mm - hmm . Grad G : So if we got someone interested in that , I think it would be great for Meeting Recorder . Professor E : Well { disfmarker } I mean , one of the things I wanted to do , uh , that I I talked to { disfmarker } to Don about , is one of the possible things he could do or m also , we could have someone else do it , is to do block echo cancellation , Grad G : Since it 's the same people over and over . PhD F : Mm - hmm . Professor E : to try to get rid of some of the effects of the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the far - field effects . Um , I mean we have { disfmarker } the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation PhD F : Mm - hmm . Professor E : because people move around , and uh , if { disfmarker } if it 's { disfmarker } if it 's uh not a simple echo , like a cross - talk kind of echo , but it 's actually room acoustics , it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } you ca n't really do inversion , PhD F : Mm - hmm . Professor E : and even echo cancellation is going to uh be something { disfmarker } It may { disfmarker } you { disfmarker } Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly and so the tack that we 've taken is more `` lets come up with feature approaches and multi - stream approaches and so forth , that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal `` . PhD F : Mm - hmm . Professor E : Uh , that 's the party line . But it occurred to me a few months ago that uh party lines are always , you know , sort of dangerous . It 's good { disfmarker } { vocalsound } good to sort of test them , actually . And so we have n't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do . So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation . Um , there was a { disfmarker } have been some nice talks recently by { disfmarker } by Lucent on { disfmarker } on their b PhD F : Hmm . Professor E : the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me , uh you know , trying and change it sample by sample , but you have some reasonable sized blocks . { comment } And um , you know , th PhD A : W what is the um { disfmarker } the artifact you try to { disfmarker } you 're trying to get rid of when you do that ? PhD F : Ciao . Professor E : Uh so it 's { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } you have a { disfmarker } a direct uh { disfmarker } Uh , what 's the difference in { disfmarker } If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would um { disfmarker } PhD F : I 'm signing off . Professor E : Yeah . that would subtract off { comment } the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant . You know , so { disfmarker } so uh um I guess in most echo cancellation { disfmarker } Yeah , so you { disfmarker } Given that um { disfmarker } Yeah , so you 're trying to { disfmarker } So you 'd { disfmarker } There 's a { disfmarker } a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there , and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections . And if you figure out well what 's the { disfmarker } there 's a { disfmarker } a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself { disfmarker } adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract { disfmarker } essentially to subtract off uh different uh { disfmarker } different reflections . Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had { disfmarker } you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something and then there 's a { disfmarker } there 's an echo . It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo . PhD A : So that would mean like if you were listening to the data that was recorded on one of those . Uh , just the raw data , you would { disfmarker } you might hear kind of an echo ? And { disfmarker } and then this { disfmarker } noise cancellation would get Professor E : Well , I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm saying { disfmarker } That 's a simplified version of what 's really happening . { comment } What 's really happening is { disfmarker } Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech , but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times . OK ? So now , if you um try to r you { disfmarker } To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons , but I { disfmarker } but { disfmarker } not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the { disfmarker } the room response , but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the { disfmarker } the effect of some of the echos . Um , a number of people have done this so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it . So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach . You say I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I want to use this uh { disfmarker } this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos . So you construct a filter , and you have this { disfmarker } this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh { disfmarker } gets subtracted off from the original speech . Then you try to { disfmarker } you try to minimize the energy in some sense . And so um { disfmarker } uh with some constraints . PhD A : Kind of a clean up thing , that { disfmarker } Professor E : It 's a clean up thing . Right . PhD A : OK . Professor E : So , echo cancelling is { disfmarker } is , you know , commonly done in telephony , and { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you { disfmarker } if , you know , you 're gon na be talking some distance from a mike . PhD A : When uh , I would have meetings with the folks in Cambridge when I was at BBN over the phone , they had a um { disfmarker } some kind of a special speaker phone and when they would first connect me , it would come on and we 'd hear all this noise . And then it was uh { disfmarker } And then it would come on and it was very clear , Professor E : Yeah . PhD A : you know . Professor E : Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights , and then it 's getting the sum . So um , uh anyway that 's { disfmarker } that 's kind of a reasonable thing that I 'd like to have somebody try { disfmarker } somebody look { disfmarker } And { disfmarker } and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with . I think that 'd be enough data { disfmarker } plenty of data to do that with , and i for that sort of task you would n't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything . Uh . { vocalsound } Um Postdoc B : Is Brian Kingsbury 's work related to that , or is it a different type of reverberation ? Professor E : Brian 's { comment } Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma . Right ? Which is what I was calling the `` party line `` , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want . We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position , and there might be , you know { disfmarker } There 's also um oh yeah , noise . So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise . It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays , Then we 'll figure out the right { disfmarker } the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those { disfmarker } those echos . But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted so that it 's decision about what the right { disfmarker } you know , right { disfmarker } right uh { disfmarker } delays are { disfmarker } is , uh { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } right delayed signal is { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } uh is incorrect . And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a { disfmarker } in a situation that 's very reverberant { disfmarker } { comment } with long reverberation times { comment } and really long delays , it 's { disfmarker } it 's sort of typically impractical . So for those kind of reasons , and also a { disfmarker } a c a complete inversion , if you actually { disfmarker } I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics . Um , that 's difficult because um often times the { disfmarker } the um { disfmarker } { vocalsound } the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable , and so , if you { disfmarker } you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and { disfmarker } and uh goes to infinity . So it 's { disfmarker } so there 's { disfmarker } there 's { disfmarker } there 's that sort of technical reason , and the fact that things move , and there 's air currents { disfmarker } I mean there 's all sorts of { disfmarker } all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical . So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } we sort of um , concluded we did n't want to in do inversion , and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which is n't really inversion , and um we decided to do this approach of taking { disfmarker } uh , just picking uh features , which were { disfmarker } uh will give you more { disfmarker } something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation , and that 's what Brian was trying to do . So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was { disfmarker } I was gon na bring up . Uh . Let 's see . I guess you { disfmarker } you actually already said this thing about the uh { disfmarker } about the consent forms , which was that we now do n't have to { disfmarker } So this was the human subjects folks who said this , { comment } or that { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } ? Postdoc B : The a apparently { disfmarker } I mean , we 're gon na do a revised form , of course . Um but once a person has signed it once , then that 's valid for a certain number of meetings . She wanted me to actually estimate how many meetings and put that on the consent form . I told her that would be a little bit difficult to say . So I think from a s practical standpoint , maybe we could have them do it once every ten meetings , or something . It wo n't be that many people who do it { pause } that often , but um just , you know , so long as they do n't forget that they 've done it , I guess . Professor E : OK . Um , back on the data thing , so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that { disfmarker } that we have . We have { disfmarker } we have an hour uh that { disfmarker } that is transcribed , we have { disfmarker } we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed , and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I do n't know , forty or fifty or something , if we { disfmarker } if this really uh { disfmarker } Well , do we have that much ? PhD C : Not really . It 's three to four per week . Professor E : Let 's see , we have { disfmarker } PhD C : So that 's what { disfmarker } You know , that { disfmarker } Professor E : uh eight weeks , uh is { disfmarker } PhD C : So that 's not a lot of hours . Professor E : Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's { disfmarker } Yeah , so like thirty { disfmarker } thirty hours ? PhD A : Three { disfmarker } Three hours . PhD C : Yeah . I mean , is there { disfmarker } I know this sounds { pause } tough but we 've got the room set up . Um I was starting to think of some projects where you would use well , similar to what we talked about with uh energy detection on the close - talking mikes . There are a number of interesting questions that you can ask about how interactions happen in a meeting , that do n't require any transcription . So what are the patterns , the energy patterns over the meeting ? And I 'm really interested in this { vocalsound } but we do n't have a whole lot of data . So I was thinking , you know , we 've got the room set up and you can always think of , also for political reasons , if ICSI collected you know , two hundred hours , that looks different than forty hours , even if we do n't transcribe it ourselves , Professor E : But I do n't think we 're gon na stop at the end of this semester . PhD C : so { disfmarker } Professor E : Right ? So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gon na have more like a hundred hours . PhD C : I mean , is there { disfmarker } Are there any other meetings here that we can record , especially meetings that have some kind of conflict in them { comment } or some kind of deci I mean , that are less well { disfmarker } I do n't { disfmarker } uh , that have some more emotional aspects to them , or strong { disfmarker } Grad G : We had some good ones earlier . PhD C : There 's laughter , um I 'm talking more about strong differences of opinion meetings , maybe with manager types , or { disfmarker } Grad G : I think it 's hard to record those . PhD C : To be allowed to record them ? Postdoc B : It 's also likely that people will cancel out afterwards . PhD C : OK . Professor E : Yeah , people will get { disfmarker } Postdoc B : But I { disfmarker } but I wanted to raise the KPFA idea . PhD C : OK . Well , if there is , anyway . Professor E : Yeah , I was gon na mention that . Grad G : Oh , that 's a good idea . That 's { disfmarker } That would be a good match . Professor E : Yeah . So { disfmarker } Yeah . So I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } uh , I { disfmarker } I 'd mentioned to Adam , and { disfmarker } that was another thing I was gon na talk { disfmarker } uh , mention to them before { disfmarker } { comment } that uh there 's uh { disfmarker } It { disfmarker } it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media . Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data , { comment } that { disfmarker } that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up and we do n't have any say about it and it 's typically one microphone , in a , uh , uh { disfmarker } or { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and so it does n't really give us the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the uh characteristics we want . Um and so I do think we 're gon na continue recording here and record what we can . But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say `` hey you have this panel show , { pause } or this { disfmarker } you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? `` And uh they may be willing to record it uh with { disfmarker } PhD C : With lapel mikes or something ? Professor E : Well , they probably already use lapel , but they might be able to have it { disfmarker } it would n't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant . PhD C : Right . Professor E : It would n't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing , and what we were gon na get from UW , you know , assuming they { disfmarker } they { disfmarker } they start recording , is n't { disfmarker } als also is not going to be this exact setup . PhD C : Right . No , I think that 'd be great , if we can get more data . Professor E : So , { comment } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I was thinking of looking into that . the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live , { comment } uh that we could invite them to have like some of their { disfmarker } { comment } record some of their shows here . Postdoc B : Wow ! PhD C : Well { disfmarker } Or { disfmarker } The thing is , they 're not as averse to wearing one of these head - mount I mean , they 're on the radio , Grad G : Right , as we are . PhD C : right ? So . { comment } Um , I think that 'd be fantastic Professor E : Right . PhD C : cuz those kinds of panels and { disfmarker } Those have interesting Professor E : Yeah . PhD C : Th - that 's an { disfmarker } a side of style { disfmarker } a style that we 're not collecting here , so it 'd be great . Professor E : And { disfmarker } and the { disfmarker } I mean , the other side to it was the { disfmarker } what { disfmarker } which is where we were coming from { disfmarker } I 'll { disfmarker } I 'll talk to you more about it later { comment } is that { disfmarker } is that there 's { disfmarker } there 's uh the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably , uh related to , you know , legal issues and { disfmarker } and permissions and all that . I mean , they already do what they do { disfmarker } do whatever they do . So it 's { disfmarker } uh , it 's { disfmarker } So it 's { disfmarker } so it 's another source . So I think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and um { disfmarker } and maybe we have this other source . But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . I mean , that was sort of our goal . The thing was , I was hoping that we could { disfmarker } @ @ in the { disfmarker } under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours . And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester . And if we continue to collect some next semester , I think we should , uh { disfmarker } PhD C : Right . Yeah I was mostly trying to think , `` OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with . And you { disfmarker } you wan na s you wan na sort of fr freeze your { disfmarker } your data for awhile so um right now { disfmarker } and we do n't have the transcripts back yet from IBM right ? Do { disfmarker } Oh , do we now ? Professor E : Well , we do n't even have it for this f you know , forty - five minutes , that was { disfmarker } PhD C : So um , not complaining , I was just trying to think , you know , what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now Professor E : Yeah . PhD C : and they 're pretty different , because Professor E : Yeah . So I was thinking right now it 's sort of this exploratory stuff where you { disfmarker } you look at the data , you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like , Grad G : Right . PhD C : um { disfmarker } Right . Right , right . Professor E : and { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and uh { disfmarker } and meanwhile we collect , and it 's more like yeah , three months from now , or six months from now you can { disfmarker } you can do a lot of other things . PhD C : Cuz I 'm not actually sure , just logistically that I can spend { disfmarker } you know , I do n't wan na charge the time that I have on the project too early , before there 's enough data to make good use of the time . And that 's { disfmarker } and especially with the student Grad G : Right . PhD C : uh for instance this guy who seems { disfmarker } Professor E : Yeah . PhD C : Uh anyway , I should n't say too much , but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring , how much data will I have to work with , with that person . And so it 's { disfmarker } Professor E : i Yeah , so I would think , exploratory things now . Uh , three months from now { disfmarker } Um , I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we have n't gotten those back yet as far as the timing , but I think as far as the collection , it does n't seem to me l like , uh , unreasonable to say that uh in January , you know , ro roughly uh { disfmarker } which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours . PhD C : And we just do n't know about the transcription part of that , Professor E : So that 's { disfmarker } Postdoc B : Yeah , we need to { disfmarker } I think that there 's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards , PhD C : so . I mean , it { disfmarker } Postdoc B : and uh es especially since these people wo n't be uh used to dealing with multi - channel uh transcriptions . PhD C : Right . Professor E : Yeah . Postdoc B : So I think that we 'll need to adjust some { disfmarker } And also if we wan na add things like um , well , more refined coding of overlaps , then definitely I think we should count on having an extra pass through . I wanted to ask another a a aspect of the data collection . There 'd be no reason why a person could n't get together several uh , you know , friends , and come and argue about a topic if they wanted to , right ? Professor E : If they really have something they wan na talk about as opposed to something @ @ { disfmarker } I mean , what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions , but I think if it 's a real { disfmarker } Why not ? Yeah . PhD C : I mean , I 'm thinking , politically { disfmarker } Grad G : Stage some political debates . Postdoc B : You could do this , PhD C : Well yeah , Postdoc B : you know . You could . PhD C : or just if you 're { disfmarker } if you ha If there are meetings here that happen that we can record even if we do n't { pause } um have them do the digits , { comment } or maybe have them do a shorter { pause } digit thing { comment } like if it was , you know , uh , one string of digits , or something , they 'd probably be willing to do . Grad G : We do n't have to do the digits at all if we do n't want to . PhD C : Then , having the data is very valuable , cuz I think it 's um politically better for us to say we have this many hours of audio data , especially with the ITR , if we put in a proposal on it . It 'll just look like ICSI 's collected a lot more audio data . Um , whether it 's transcribed or not um , is another issue , but there 's { disfmarker } there are research questions you can answer without the transcriptions , or at least that you can start to answer . Postdoc B : It seems like you could hold some meetings . Grad G : Yep . Postdoc B : You know , you and maybe Adam ? PhD C : So . Postdoc B : You { disfmarker } you could { disfmarker } you could maybe hold some additional meetings , if you wanted . PhD A : Would it help at all { disfmarker } I mean , we 're already talking about sort of two levels of detail in meetings . One is uh um without doing the digits { disfmarker } Or , I guess the full - blown one is where you do the digits , and everything , and then talk about doing it without digits , what if we had another level , just to collect data , which is without the headsets and we just did the table - mounted stuff . PhD C : Need the close - talking mikes . PhD A : You do , OK . PhD C : I mean , absolutely , Professor E : Yeah . Yeah . PhD C : yeah . I 'm really scared { disfmarker } Grad G : It seems like it 's a big part of this corpus is to have the close - talking mikes . PhD A : I see , OK . PhD C : Um or at least , like , me personally ? I would { disfmarker } { comment } I { disfmarker } could n't use that data . Professor E : Yeah . Postdoc B : I agree . And Mari also , PhD C : Um . Postdoc B : we had { disfmarker } This came up when she she was here . That 's important . PhD C : So it 's a great idea , Professor E : Yeah , I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } b By the { disfmarker } by the way , I do n't think the transcriptions are actually , in the long run , such a big bottleneck . PhD C : and if it were true than I would just do that , but it 's not that bad { disfmarker } like the room is not the bottleneck , and we have enough time in the room , it 's getting the people to come in and put on the { disfmarker } and get the setup going . Professor E : I think the issue is just that we 're { disfmarker } we 're blazing that path . Right ? And { disfmarker } and um { disfmarker } d Do you have any idea when { disfmarker } when uh the { disfmarker } you 'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them ? Grad G : Well , I 've been burning two C Ds a day , which is about all I can do with the time I have . Professor E : Yeah . Yeah . Grad G : So it 'll be early next week . Professor E : Yeah , OK . So early next week we send it to them , and then { disfmarker } then we check with them to see if they 've got it and we { disfmarker } we start , you know asking about the timing for it . Grad G : Yep . Professor E : So I think once they get it sorted out about how they 're gon na do it , which I think they 're pretty well along on , cuz they were able to read the files and so on . Grad G : Yep . Professor E : Right ? Grad G : Yeah , but { disfmarker } Professor E : Well { disfmarker } Grad G : Yeah , who knows where they are . PhD A : Have they ever responded to you ? Grad G : Nope . Professor E : Yeah , but { disfmarker } You know , so they { disfmarker } they { disfmarker } they have { disfmarker } you know , they 're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do , PhD C : What if { disfmarker } Grad G : Yeah , you { disfmarker } we ca n't complain . Professor E : right ? But they { disfmarker } But at any rate , they 'll { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I think once they get that sorted out , they 're { disfmarker } they 're making cassettes there , then they 're handing it to someone who they { disfmarker } who 's { disfmarker } who is doing it , and uh I think it 's not going to be { disfmarker } I do n't think it 's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour , I think . It 's not going to be thirty Grad G : Yep . I think that 's probably true . PhD C : Really ? So it 's the amount of { disfmarker } Professor E : It 's { disfmarker } it 's just getting it going . Grad G : It 's pipeline , pipeline issues . PhD C : Right . What about these lunch meetings { disfmarker } Grad G : Once the pipeline fills . PhD C : I mean , I do n't know , if there 's any way without too much more overhead , even if we do n't ship it right away to IBM even if we just collect it here for awhile , { comment } to record you know , two or three more meeting a week , just to have the data , even if they 're um not doing the digits , but they do wear the headphones ? Professor E : But the lunch meetings are pretty much one person getting up and { disfmarker } PhD C : No , I meant , um , sorry , the meetings where people eat their lunch downstairs , maybe they do n't wan na be recorded , but { disfmarker } Grad G : Oh , and we 're just chatting ? PhD C : Just the ch the chatting . Grad G : Yeah , we have a lot of those . PhD C : I actually { disfmarker } I actually think that 's { pause } useful { pause } data , um { pause } the chatting , Grad G : Yeah , the problem with that is I would { disfmarker } I think I would feel a little constrained to { disfmarker } You know ? Uh , some of the meetings { disfmarker } PhD C : but { disfmarker } OK . You do n't wan na do it , cuz { disfmarker } OK . Grad G : You know , our `` soccer ball `` meeting ? PhD C : Alright . Grad G : I guess none of you were there for our soccer ball meeting . PhD C : Alright , { comment } so I 'll just throw it out there , if anyone knows of one more m or two more wee meetings per week that happen at ICSI , um that we could record , I think it would be worth it . Grad G : That was hilarious . Professor E : Yeah . Well , we should also check with Mari again , because they { disfmarker } because they were really intending , you know , maybe just did n't happen , but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level . So then that would double { pause } what we had . Uh . And there 's a lot of different meetings at UW uh { disfmarker } I mean really m a lot more { comment } than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus , Grad G : Right . Professor E : so . PhD A : Is the uh , notion of recording any of Chuck 's meetings dead in the water , or is that still a possibility ? Professor E : Uh , { vocalsound } they seem to have some problems with it . We can { disfmarker } we can talk about that later . Um , but , again , Jerry is { disfmarker } Jerry 's open { disfmarker } So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting , uh Jerry was open to it but I { disfmarker } I s One of the things that I think is a little { disfmarker } a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably ca n't do it every week . You know ? I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I think that { disfmarker } that people are gon na feel uh { disfmarker } are gon na feel a little bit constrained . Now , it might get a little better if we do n't have them do the digits all the time . And the { disfmarker } then { disfmarker } so then they can just really sort of try to { disfmarker } put the mikes on and then just charge in and { disfmarker } Grad G : Yep . PhD C : What if we give people { disfmarker } you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ? Postdoc B : Well , you know , I { disfmarker } I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise . PhD C : OK . Postdoc B : But I had another question , which is um , you know , in principle , w um , I know that you do n't want artificial topics , PhD C : Alright , alright , alright . Postdoc B : but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that would n't be too artificial . I mean , we could { disfmarker } political discussions , or { disfmarker } or something or other , PhD C : No , definitely . Postdoc B : and i you know , people who are { disfmarker } Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d it 's like , you know , the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } uh goldibears { disfmarker } goldi goldilocks , it 's like you do n't want meetings that are too large , but you do n't want meetings that are too small . And um { disfmarker } a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word . PhD A : Well , even { disfmarker } I mean , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about Postdoc B : We could pay subjects . PhD A : or what about people in the { disfmarker } in the building ? PhD C : Yeah , I was thinking , there 's all these other peo PhD A : I mean , there 's the State of California downstairs , and { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . I mean { disfmarker } Grad G : I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public . Postdoc B : Yeah . PhD A : Oh . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Grad G : So I { disfmarker } I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition PhD C : Alright , well . Grad G : and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said `` well maybe we could have meetings down here `` , but then I got email from them that said `` no , we decided we 're not really interested and we do n't wan na come down and hold meetings . `` So , I think it 's gon na be a problem to get people regularly . PhD A : What about Joachim , maybe he can { disfmarker } Professor E : But { disfmarker } but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that . And I { disfmarker } I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the { disfmarker } with the radio . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor E : Uh i I have better contacts in radio than in television , but { disfmarker } PhD A : You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones . PhD C : Well , and they 're already { disfmarker } they 're { disfmarker } these things are already recorded , Grad G : Yep . Professor E : Yeah . PhD C : we do n't have to ask them to { disfmarker } even { disfmarker } and I 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual { disfmarker } Professor E : n Well { disfmarker } No , I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded . I 'm talking about new ones PhD C : Why { disfmarker } why not ? Professor E : because { disfmarker } because { disfmarker } because we would be asking them to do something different . PhD C : Well , we can find out . I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in { disfmarker } in LDC getting { pause } data , uh , and { disfmarker } Professor E : Right , that 's the found data idea . PhD C : Yeah . Professor E : But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor E : And u I think routinely they would not do this . So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wan na make sure that there is at least that somewhere PhD C : Right . Great . OK . Professor E : and uh { disfmarker } But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } I might be able to talk them into it . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Grad G : Um . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space , so we should think about trying to wrap up here . PhD C : That 's a good way to end a meeting . Professor E : OK . Well I do n't { disfmarker } why do n't we { disfmarker } why d u why do n't we uh uh turn them { disfmarker } turn Grad G : OK , leave { disfmarker } leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time . Postdoc B : Oh . That 's good to know . Professor E : Turning off the microphone made it crash . Well { disfmarker } Postdoc B : That 's good to know . Professor E : OK . 
Query : What was agreed upon on sample transcripts ? PhD D : Sure , because I { disfmarker } I need a lot of time to { disfmarker } to put the label or to do that . Yeah . Professor E : Yeah , I mean , we we know that there 's noise . Grad G : And PhD D : Uh - huh . Professor E : There 's { disfmarker } there 's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth , and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : and { disfmarker } and something in between with paper rustling . We know that all that 's there and it 's a g worthwhile thing to study , but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things . PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : Whereas th i I would think that uh you { disfmarker } we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking . PhD D : Uh - huh . OK . OK . Professor E : So . Then you can get the { disfmarker } Cuz you need { disfmarker } If it 's three hundred uh { disfmarker } i i it sounds like you probably only have fifty or sixty or seventy events right now that are really { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : And { disfmarker } and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of { disfmarker } of what 's going on , much less any kind of reasonable statistics . Grad G : Right . PhD C : Now , why do you need to mark speaker overlap by hand if you can infer it from the relative energy in the { disfmarker } Grad G : Well , that 's { disfmarker } That 's what I was gon na bring up . PhD C : I mean , you should n't need to do this p completely by hand , Professor E : Um , OK , yeah . So let 's back up because you were n't here for an earlier conversation . PhD C : right ? I 'm sorry . Professor E : So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures such as the increase in energy , such as the energy in the LPC residuals , such as { disfmarker } I mean there 's a bunch of things { disfmarker } I mean , increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one . PhD C : Mm - hmm . In the far - field mike . Professor E : Yeah . PhD C : Oh , OK . Professor E : Um , and uh , it 's not obvious , I mean , you could { disfmarker } you could do the dumbest thing and get { disfmarker } get it ninety percent of the time . But when you start going past that and trying to do better , it 's not obvious what combination of features is gon na give you the { disfmarker } you know , the right detector . So the idea is to have some ground truth first . And so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say `` OK this , i you know , it 's { disfmarker } it 's really here `` . PhD A : But I think Liz is saying why not get it out of the transcripts ? PhD C : What I mean is { pause } get it from the close - talking mikes . Professor E : Uh , yeah . PhD C : A or ge get a first pass from those , Professor E : We t we t w we t we talked about that . PhD C : and then go through sort of { disfmarker } It 'd be a lot faster probably to { disfmarker } PhD F : And you can { disfmarker } Grad G : Yeah , that 's his , uh { disfmarker } Professor E : We { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } we talked about that . s But so it 's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is , PhD C : Yeah , I just { disfmarker } Professor E : the idea was , i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway , and { disfmarker } and then whatever he could mark would be helpful , PhD C : Right . Professor E : and we could { disfmarker } Uh it 's a question of what you bootstrap from . You know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better , or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then { disfmarker } then do your simple measurements , uh from the close - talking mike . I mean , even with the close - talking mike you 're not gon na get it right all the time . PhD C : Well , that 's what I wonder , because um { disfmarker } or how bad it is , Professor E : Well PhD C : be um , because that would be interesting Grad G : I 'm working on a program to do that , and { disfmarker } PhD C : especially because the bottleneck is the transcription . Right ? I mean , we 've got a lot more data than we have transcriptions for . We have the audio data , we have the close - talking mike , Professor E : Yeah . PhD C : so I mean it seems like one kind of project that 's not perfect , but { disfmarker } um , that you can get the training data for pretty quickly is , you know , if you infer form the close - talking mikes where the on - off points are of speech , Professor E : Right , we discussed that . PhD C : you know , how can we detect that from a far - field ? Grad G : And { disfmarker } Postdoc B : Oh . Grad G : I 've { disfmarker } I 've written a program to do that , PhD C : OK , I 'm sorry I missed the { disfmarker } Grad G : and it , uh { disfmarker } Professor E : It 's OK . Grad G : and { disfmarker } so { disfmarker } but it 's { disfmarker } it 's doing something very , very simple . It just takes a threshold , based on { disfmarker } on the volume , PhD C : Uh - huh . PhD F : Or you can set the threshold low and then weed out the false alarms by hand . PhD C : Right , by hand . Yeah . PhD F : Yeah . Grad G : um , and then it does a median filter , and then it looks for runs . And , it seems to work , I 've { disfmarker } I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters , to get it to actually generate something , and I have n't { disfmarker } I do n't { disfmarker } what I 'm working on { disfmarker } was working on { disfmarker } was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have , { pause } into Transcriber . And so { disfmarker } I told { disfmarker } I said it would take about a day . I 've worked on it for about half a day , Grad H : I have to go . Grad G : so give me another half day and I we 'll have something we can play with . PhD C : OK . Professor E : See , this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working , because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this , and I 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided , PhD C : Right . I 'm sorry . I just { disfmarker } Professor E : but I could n't remember all of it . PhD C : It Professor E : So , I think it was partly that , you know , give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like , partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against , you know , when { disfmarker } when he { disfmarker } he gets his thing going , Grad G : But { disfmarker } Professor E : uh , and { disfmarker } PhD C : Well , it 's definitely good to have somebody look at it . I was just thinking as a way to speed up you know , the amount of { disfmarker } Postdoc B : Mm - hmm . Professor E : That was { disfmarker } that was exactly the notion that { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } that we discussed . PhD C : OK . 
Query : What was said on speech overlap ? PhD D : Uh - huh . OK . Professor E : So . { vocalsound } Right . PhD F : As opposed to the rest of us . PhD D : Well - { comment } { vocalsound } OK . I { disfmarker } I remind that me { disfmarker } my first objective eh , in the project is to { disfmarker } to study difference parameters to { disfmarker } to find a { disfmarker } a good solution to detect eh , the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded . But eh , { vocalsound } tsk , { comment } { vocalsound } ehhh { comment } In that way { comment } I { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I begin to { disfmarker } to study and to analyze the ehn { disfmarker } the recorded speech eh the different session to { disfmarker } to find and to locate and to mark eh the { disfmarker } the different overlapping zone . And eh so eh I was eh { disfmarker } I am transcribing the { disfmarker } the first session and I { disfmarker } I have found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events , eh besides the overlapping zones , eh I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh , eh , talk eh , eh , clap , eh { disfmarker } { comment } I do n't know what is the different names eh you use to { disfmarker } to name the { disfmarker } the { pause } n speech PhD A : Nonspeech sounds ? PhD D : Yeah . Grad G : Oh , I do n't think we 've been doing it at that level of detail . So . PhD D : Yeah . Eh , { vocalsound } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I do I do n't need to { disfmarker } to { disfmarker } to mmm { vocalsound } { disfmarker } to m to label the { disfmarker } the different acoustic , but I prefer because eh I would like to { disfmarker } to study if eh , I { disfmarker } I will find eh , eh , a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping I would like to { disfmarker } to { disfmarker } to test these parameters eh with the { disfmarker } another eh , eh acoustic events , to nnn { disfmarker } { vocalsound } to eh { disfmarker } to find what is the ehm { disfmarker } the false { disfmarker } eh , the false eh hypothesis eh , nnn , which eh are produced when we use the { disfmarker } the ehm { disfmarker } this eh parameter { disfmarker } eh I mean pitch eh , eh , difference eh , feature { disfmarker } Grad G : Mm - hmm . PhD A : You know { disfmarker } I think some of these um that are the nonspeech overlapping events may be difficult even for humans to tell that there 's two there . Grad G : So it was { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah . PhD A : I mean , if it 's a tapping sound , you would n't necessarily { disfmarker } or , you know , something like that , it 'd be { disfmarker } it might be hard to know that it was two separate events . PhD D : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Grad G : Well { disfmarker } You were n't talking about just overlaps PhD D : Ye Grad G : were you ? You were just talking about acoustic events . PhD D : I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general , Grad G : Someone starts , someone stops { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD A : Oh . PhD D : but eh my { disfmarker } my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone . Grad G : Mm - hmm . PhD D : Eh ? { comment } n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events . Professor E : How many overlaps were there uh in it ? No no , how many of them were the overlaps of speech , though ? PhD D : How many ? Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session Grad G : Oh , God ! PhD D : in five { disfmarker } eh in forty - five minutes . PhD A : Three hundred overlapping speech { disfmarker } PhD D : Alm - Three hundred overlapping zone . Grad G : Ugh . PhD C : Overlapping speech . PhD D : With the overlapping zone , overlapping speech { disfmarker } speech what eh different duration . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor E : Sure . Postdoc B : Does this { disfmarker } ? So if you had an overlap involving three people , how many times was that counted ? PhD D : Yeah , three people , two people . Eh , um I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background , be Professor E : No no , but I think what she 's asking is { pause } if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking , instead of two , did you call that one event ? PhD D : Oh . Oh . Yeah . I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone . This { disfmarker } th I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I con I consider { disfmarker } I consider eh an acoustic event , the overlapping zone , the period where three speaker or eh { disfmarker } are talking together . Grad G : Well { disfmarker } So let 's { disfmarker } Postdoc B : For Grad G : So let 's say me and Jane are talking at the same time , and then Liz starts talking also over all of us . How many events would that be ? PhD D : So - I do n't understand . Grad G : So , two people are talking , { comment } and then a third person starts talking . PhD D : Yeah ? Grad G : Is there an event right here ? PhD D : Eh no . No no . For me is the overlapping zone , because { disfmarker } because you { disfmarker } you have s you have more one { disfmarker } eh , more one voice eh , eh produced in a { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } in a moment . Professor E : I see . Grad G : So i if two or more people are talking . Professor E : OK . Yeah . So I think { disfmarker } Yeah . We just wanted to understand how you 're defining it . PhD D : Yeah . If Professor E : So then , in the region between { disfmarker } since there { disfmarker } there is some continuous region , in between regions where there is only one person speaking . PhD D : Uh - huh . Professor E : And one contiguous region like that you 're calling an event . PhD D : Uh - huh . Professor E : Is it { disfmarker } Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event , PhD D : Yeah . Professor E : or are you calling the entire length of it the event ? PhD D : I consider the { disfmarker } the , nnn { disfmarker } the nnn , nnn { disfmarker } eh , the entirety eh , eh , all { disfmarker } all the time there were { disfmarker } the voice has overlapped . Professor E : OK . PhD D : This is the idea . But eh I { disfmarker } I do n't distinguish between the { disfmarker } the numbers of eh speaker . Uh , I 'm not considering { vocalsound } eh the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } ehm { vocalsound } eh , the fact of eh , eh , for example , what did you say ? Eh at first eh , eh two talkers are uh , eh speaking , and eh , eh a third person eh join to { disfmarker } to that . For me , it 's eh { disfmarker } it 's eh , all overlap zone , with eh several numbers of speakers is eh , eh the same acoustic event . Wi - but { disfmarker } uh , without any mark between the zone { disfmarker } of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together , and the zone with the three speakers . Postdoc B : That would j just be one . PhD D : It { disfmarker } One . One . Postdoc B : OK . PhD D : Eh , with eh , a beginning mark and the ending mark . Because eh { vocalsound } for me , is the { disfmarker } is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral . Professor E : Got it . PhD D : I do n't mind { disfmarker } By the moment , by the moment . Grad G : Well , but { disfmarker } But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two . PhD D : I { disfmarker } I do n't { disfmarker } Yeah , but eh { disfmarker } but eh I have to study . { comment } What will happen in a general way , Professor E : Could . Grad G : So . You had to start somewhere . Professor E : Yeah . We just w PhD C : So there 's a lot of overlap . PhD D : I { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I do n't know what eh will { disfmarker } will happen with the { disfmarker } Grad G : Yep . PhD C : So . Grad G : That 's a lot of overlap , PhD D : Yeah ? Professor E : So again , that 's { disfmarker } that 's three { disfmarker } three hundred in forty - five minutes that are { disfmarker } that are speakers , just speakers . Grad G : yeah , for forty - five minutes . PhD D : Yeah . Yeah . Professor E : Uh - huh . OK . Yeah . Postdoc B : But a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a th Professor E : So that 's about eight per minute . Postdoc B : But a thousand events in twelve minutes , that 's { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah , { pause } but { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD C : But that can include taps . PhD D : But { disfmarker } Professor E : Uh . Yeah . Postdoc B : Well , but a thousand taps in eight minutes is a l in twelve minutes is a lot . PhD D : General . PhD C : Actually { disfmarker } PhD D : I { disfmarker } I con I consider { disfmarker } I consider acoustic events eh , the silent too . Postdoc B : Silent . Grad G : Silence starting or silence ending { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah , silent , ground to { disfmarker } bec to detect { disfmarker } eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech . PhD C : Oh , OK . Professor E : Mm - hmm . PhD A : Oh . PhD D : In ge in { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } in a general point of view . PhD C : Oh . Professor E : OK , so how many of those thousand were silence ? PhD C : Alright . PhD D : in the per PhD F : Not speech { disfmarker } not speech or too much speech . PhD D : Too much speech . Professor E : Right . So how many of those thousand were silence , silent sections ? PhD D : Yeah . Uh silent , I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I do n't { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I have n't the { disfmarker } eh I { disfmarker } I would like to { disfmarker } to do a stylistic study Professor E : Yeah . 
Query : What ’ s the current status of recordings and transcriptions ? Professor E : And { disfmarker } and the { disfmarker } I mean , the other side to it was the { disfmarker } what { disfmarker } which is where we were coming from { disfmarker } I 'll { disfmarker } I 'll talk to you more about it later { comment } is that { disfmarker } is that there 's { disfmarker } there 's uh the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably , uh related to , you know , legal issues and { disfmarker } and permissions and all that . I mean , they already do what they do { disfmarker } do whatever they do . So it 's { disfmarker } uh , it 's { disfmarker } So it 's { disfmarker } so it 's another source . So I think it 's something we should look into , you know , we 'll collect what we collect here hopefully they will collect more at UW also and um { disfmarker } and maybe we have this other source . But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours . I mean , that was sort of our goal . The thing was , I was hoping that we could { disfmarker } @ @ in the { disfmarker } under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours . And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester . And if we continue to collect some next semester , I think we should , uh { disfmarker } PhD C : Right . Yeah I was mostly trying to think , `` OK , if you start a project , within say a month , you know , how much data do you have to work with . And you { disfmarker } you wan na s you wan na sort of fr freeze your { disfmarker } your data for awhile so um right now { disfmarker } and we do n't have the transcripts back yet from IBM right ? Do { disfmarker } Oh , do we now ? Professor E : Well , we do n't even have it for this f you know , forty - five minutes , that was { disfmarker } PhD C : So um , not complaining , I was just trying to think , you know , what kinds of projects can you do now versus uh six months from now Professor E : Yeah . PhD C : and they 're pretty different , because Professor E : Yeah . So I was thinking right now it 's sort of this exploratory stuff where you { disfmarker } you look at the data , you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like , Grad G : Right . PhD C : um { disfmarker } Right . Right , right . Professor E : and { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and uh { disfmarker } and meanwhile we collect , and it 's more like yeah , three months from now , or six months from now you can { disfmarker } you can do a lot of other things . PhD C : Cuz I 'm not actually sure , just logistically that I can spend { disfmarker } you know , I do n't wan na charge the time that I have on the project too early , before there 's enough data to make good use of the time . And that 's { disfmarker } and especially with the student Grad G : Right . PhD C : uh for instance this guy who seems { disfmarker } Professor E : Yeah . PhD C : Uh anyway , I should n't say too much , but um if someone came that was great and wanted to do some real work and they have to end by the end of this school year in the spring , how much data will I have to work with , with that person . And so it 's { disfmarker } Professor E : i Yeah , so I would think , exploratory things now . Uh , three months from now { disfmarker } Um , I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we have n't gotten those back yet as far as the timing , but I think as far as the collection , it does n't seem to me l like , uh , unreasonable to say that uh in January , you know , ro roughly uh { disfmarker } which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours . PhD C : And we just do n't know about the transcription part of that , Professor E : So that 's { disfmarker } Postdoc B : Yeah , we need to { disfmarker } I think that there 's a possibility that the transcript will need to be adjusted afterwards , PhD C : so . I mean , it { disfmarker } Postdoc B : and uh es especially since these people wo n't be uh used to dealing with multi - channel uh transcriptions . PhD C : Right . Professor E : Yeah . 
Query : What was the future of data collection ? Grad G : That was hilarious . Professor E : Yeah . Well , we should also check with Mari again , because they { disfmarker } because they were really intending , you know , maybe just did n't happen , but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level . So then that would double { pause } what we had . Uh . And there 's a lot of different meetings at UW uh { disfmarker } I mean really m a lot more { comment } than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus , Grad G : Right . Professor E : so . PhD A : Is the uh , notion of recording any of Chuck 's meetings dead in the water , or is that still a possibility ? Professor E : Uh , { vocalsound } they seem to have some problems with it . We can { disfmarker } we can talk about that later . Um , but , again , Jerry is { disfmarker } Jerry 's open { disfmarker } So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting , uh Jerry was open to it but I { disfmarker } I s One of the things that I think is a little { disfmarker } a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably ca n't do it every week . You know ? I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I think that { disfmarker } that people are gon na feel uh { disfmarker } are gon na feel a little bit constrained . Now , it might get a little better if we do n't have them do the digits all the time . And the { disfmarker } then { disfmarker } so then they can just really sort of try to { disfmarker } put the mikes on and then just charge in and { disfmarker } Grad G : Yep . PhD C : What if we give people { disfmarker } you know , we cater a lunch in exchange for them having their meeting here or something ? Postdoc B : Well , you know , I { disfmarker } I do think eating while you 're doing a meeting is going to be increasing the noise . PhD C : OK . Postdoc B : But I had another question , which is um , you know , in principle , w um , I know that you do n't want artificial topics , PhD C : Alright , alright , alright . Postdoc B : but um it does seem to me that we might be able to get subjects from campus to come down and do something that would n't be too artificial . I mean , we could { disfmarker } political discussions , or { disfmarker } or something or other , PhD C : No , definitely . Postdoc B : and i you know , people who are { disfmarker } Because , you know , there 's also this constraint . We d it 's like , you know , the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } uh goldibears { disfmarker } goldi goldilocks , it 's like you do n't want meetings that are too large , but you do n't want meetings that are too small . And um { disfmarker } a and it just seems like maybe we could exploit the subj human subject p p pool , in the positive sense of the word . PhD A : Well , even { disfmarker } I mean , coming down from campus is sort of a big thing , but what about Postdoc B : We could pay subjects . PhD A : or what about people in the { disfmarker } in the building ? PhD C : Yeah , I was thinking , there 's all these other peo PhD A : I mean , there 's the State of California downstairs , and { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . I mean { disfmarker } Grad G : I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public . Postdoc B : Yeah . PhD A : Oh . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Grad G : So I { disfmarker } I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition PhD C : Alright , well . Grad G : and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said `` well maybe we could have meetings down here `` , but then I got email from them that said `` no , we decided we 're not really interested and we do n't wan na come down and hold meetings . `` So , I think it 's gon na be a problem to get people regularly . PhD A : What about Joachim , maybe he can { disfmarker } Professor E : But { disfmarker } but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that . And I { disfmarker } I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the { disfmarker } with the radio . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor E : Uh i I have better contacts in radio than in television , but { disfmarker } PhD A : You could get a lot of lively discussions from those radio ones . PhD C : Well , and they 're already { disfmarker } they 're { disfmarker } these things are already recorded , Grad G : Yep . Professor E : Yeah . PhD C : we do n't have to ask them to { disfmarker } even { disfmarker } and I 'm not sure wh how they record it , but they must record from individual { disfmarker } Professor E : n Well { disfmarker } No , I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded . I 'm talking about new ones PhD C : Why { disfmarker } why not ? Professor E : because { disfmarker } because { disfmarker } because we would be asking them to do something different . PhD C : Well , we can find out . I know for instance Mark Liberman was interested uh in { disfmarker } in LDC getting { pause } data , uh , and { disfmarker } Professor E : Right , that 's the found data idea . PhD C : Yeah . Professor E : But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor E : And u I think routinely they would not do this . So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wan na make sure that there is at least that somewhere PhD C : Right . Great . OK . Professor E : and uh { disfmarker } But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } I might be able to talk them into it . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Grad G : Um . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space , so we should think about trying to wrap up here . PhD C : That 's a good way to end a meeting . Professor E : OK . Well I do n't { disfmarker } why do n't we { disfmarker } why d u why do n't we uh uh turn them { disfmarker } turn Grad G : OK , leave { disfmarker } leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time . Postdoc B : Oh . That 's good to know . Professor E : Turning off the microphone made it crash . Well { disfmarker } Postdoc B : That 's good to know . Professor E : OK . 
Query : What was the meeting about ? Grad B : what things to talk about . Grad F : I 'm { disfmarker } What ? Really ? Oh , that 's horrible ! Disincentive ! Grad A : OK , we 're recording . Grad F : Hello ? Grad B : Check check { pause } check check . Grad D : Uh , yeah . Grad F : Hello ? Which am I ? Professor C : Oh right . Grad B : Alright . Good . Grad F : Channel fi OK . OK . Are you doing something ? OK , then I guess I 'm doing something . So , um , So basically the result of m much thinking since the last time we met , um , but not as much writing , um , is a sheet that I have a lot of , like , thoughts and justification of comments on but I 'll just pass out as is right now . So , um , here . If you could pass this around ? And there 's two things . And so one on one side is { disfmarker } on one side is a sort of the revised sort of updated semantic specification . Grad D : Um { disfmarker } The { disfmarker } wait . Grad F : And the other side is , um , sort of a revised construction formalism . Grad E : This is just one sheet , right ? Grad D : Ah ! Just one sheet . Grad F : It 's just one sheet . Grad D : OK . Grad F : It 's just a { disfmarker } Nothing else . Grad D : Front , back . Grad F : Um , Enough to go around ? OK . And in some ways it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } it 's very similar to { disfmarker } There are very few changes in some ways from what we 've , um , uh , b done before but I do n't think everyone here has seen all of this . So , uh , I 'm not sure where to begin . Um , as usual the disclaimers are there are { disfmarker } all these things are { disfmarker } it 's only slightly more stable than it was before . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : And , um , after a little bit more discussion and especially like Keith and I { disfmarker } I have more linguistic things to settle in the next few days , um , it 'll probably change again some more . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Um , maybe I will { disfmarker } let 's start b let 's start on number two actually on the notation , um , because that 's , I 'm thinking , possibly a little more familiar to , um { disfmarker } to people . OK , so the top block is just sort of a { disfmarker } sort of abstract nota it 's sort of like , um , listings of the kinds of things that we can have . And certain things that have , um , changed , have changed back to this . There { disfmarker } there 's been a little bit of , um , going back and forth . But basically obviously all constructions have some kind of name . I forgot to include that you could have a type included in this line . Professor C : What I was gon na { disfmarker } Right . Grad F : So something like , um { disfmarker } Well , there 's an example { disfmarker } the textual example at the end has clausal construction . So , um , just to show it does n't have to be beautiful It could be , you know , simple old text as well . Um , there are a couple of { disfmarker } Uh , these three have various ways of doing certain things . So I 'll just try to go through them . So they could all have a type at the beginning . Um , and then they say the key word construction Professor C : Oh , I see . Grad F : and they have some name . Professor C : So { disfmarker } so the current syntax is if it s if there 's a type it 's before construct Grad F : Yeah , right . Professor C : OK , that 's fine . Grad F : OK , and then it has a block that is constituents . And as usual I guess all the constructions her all the examples here have only , um , tsk { comment } one type of constituent , that is a constructional constituent . I think that 's actually gon na turn out to m be certainly the most common kind . But in general instead of the word `` construct `` , th here you might have `` meaning `` or `` form `` as well . OK ? So if there 's some element that does n't { disfmarker } that is n't yet constructional in the sense that it maps form and meaning . OK , um , the main change with the constructs which { disfmarker } each of which has , um , the key word `` construct `` and then some name , and then some type specification , is that it 's { disfmarker } it 's pro it 's often { disfmarker } sometimes the case in the first case here that you know what kind of construction it is . So for example whatever I have here is gon na be a form of the word `` throw `` , or it 's gon na be a form of the word , you know , I do n't know , `` happy `` , or something like that . Or , you know , some it 'll be a specific word or maybe you 'll have the type . You 'll say `` I need a p uh spatial relation phrase here `` or `` I need a directional specifier here `` . So - uh you could have a j a actual type here . Um , or you could just say in the second case that you only know the meaning type . So a very common example of this is that , you know , in directed motion , the first person to do something should be an agent of some kind , often a human . Right ? So if I { disfmarker } you know , the um , uh , run down the street then I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I run down the street , it 's typed , uh , `` I `` , meaning category is what 's there . The { disfmarker } the new kind is this one that is sort of a pair and , um , sort of skipping fonts and whatever . The idea is that sometimes there are , um , general constructions that you know , that you 're going to need . It 's { disfmarker } it 's the equivalent of a noun phrase or a prepositional phrase , or something like that there . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : And usually it has formal um , considerations that will go along with it . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad F : And then uh , you might know something much more specific depending on what construction you 're talking about , about what meaning { disfmarker } what specific meaning you want . So the example again at the bottom , which is directed motion , you might need a nominal expression to take the place of , you know , um , `` the big th `` , you you know , `` the big { disfmarker } the tall dark man `` , you know , `` walked into the room `` . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : But because of the nature of this particular construction you know not just that it 's nominal of some kind but in particular , that it 's some kind of animate nominal , and which will apply just as well to like , you know , a per you know , a simple proper noun or to some complicated expression . Um , so I do n't know if the syntax will hold but something that gives you a way to do both constructional and meaning types . So . OK , then I do n't think the , { comment } um { disfmarker } at least { disfmarker } Yeah . { comment } None of these examples have anything different for formal constraints ? But you can refer to any of the , um , sort of available elements and scope , right ? which here are the constructs , { comment } to say something about the relation . And I think i if you not if you compare like the top block and the textual block , um , we dropped like the little F subscript . The F subscripts refer to the `` form `` piece of the construct . Professor C : Good . Grad F : And I think that , um , in general it 'll be unambiguous . Like if you were giving a formal constraint then you 're referring to the formal pole of that . So { disfmarker } so by saying { disfmarker } if I just said `` Name one `` then that means name one formal and we 're talking about formal struc { comment } Which { disfmarker } which makes sense . Uh , there are certain times when we 'll have an exception to that , in which case you could just indicate `` here I mean the meaningful for some reason `` . Right ? Or { disfmarker } Actually it 's more often that , only to handle this one special case of , you know , `` George and Jerry walk into the room in that order `` . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : So we have a few funny things where something in the meaning might refer to something in the form . But { disfmarker } but s we 're not gon na really worry about that for right now and there are way We can be more specific if we have to later on . OK , and so in terms of the { disfmarker } the relations , you know , as usual they 're before and ends . I should have put an example in of something that is n't an interval relation but in form you might also have a value binding . You know , you could say that , um , you know , `` name - one dot `` , t you know , `` number equals `` , you know , a plural or something like that . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : There are certain things that are attribute - value , similar to the bindings below but I mean they 're just { disfmarker } us usually they 're going to be value { disfmarker } value fillers , right ? OK , and then again semantic constraints here are just { disfmarker } are just bindings . There was talk of changing the name of that . And Johno and I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } you { disfmarker } you and I can like fight about that if you like ? but about changing it to `` semantic { pause } n effects `` , which I thought was a little bit too order - biased Grad B : Well { disfmarker } Th Grad F : and `` semantic bindings `` , which I thought might be too restrictive in case we do n't have only bindings . And so it was an issue whether constraints { disfmarker } um , there were some linguists who reacted against `` constraints `` , saying , `` oh , if it 's not used for matching , then it should n't be called a constraint `` . But I think we want to be uncommitted about whether it 's used for matching or not . Right ? Cuz there are { disfmarker } I think we thought of some situations where it would be useful to use whatever the c bindings are , for actual , you know , sort of like modified constraining purposes . Professor C : Well , you definitely want to de - couple the formalism from the parsing strategy . So that whether or not it 's used for matching or only for verification , I { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Yeah , yeah . It 's used should n't matter , right ? Mm - hmm . Professor C : s For sure . I mean , I do n't know what , uh , term we want to use Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : but we do n't want to { disfmarker } Grad F : Yeah , uh , there was one time when { disfmarker } when Hans explained why `` constraints `` was a misleading word for him . Professor C : Yep . Grad F : And I think the reason that he gave was similar to the reason why Johno thought it was a misleading term , which was just an interesting coincidence . Um , but , uh { disfmarker } And so I was like , `` OK , well both of you do n't like it ? Professor C : It 's g it 's gone . Grad F : Fine , we can change it `` . But I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I 'm starting to like it again . Grad B : But { disfmarker } Grad F : So that that 's why { disfmarker } { comment } That 's why I 'll stick with it . Grad A : Well , you know what ? Grad F : So { disfmarker } Grad A : If you have an `` if - then `` phrase , do you know what the `` then `` phrase is called ? Professor C : Th Grad F : What ? Con - uh , a consequent ? Grad A : Yeah . Grad F : Yeah , but it 's not an `` if - then `` . Grad A : No , but { disfmarker } Professor C : I know . Anyway , so the other { disfmarker } the other strategy you guys could consider is when you do n't know what word to put , you could put no word , Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : just meaning . OK ? And the then let { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Yeah , that 's true . Grad B : So that 's why you put semantic constraints up top and meaning bindings down { disfmarker } down here ? Grad F : Oh , oops ! No . That was just a mistake of cut and paste from when I was going with it . Grad B : OK . Professor C : OK . Grad F : So , I 'm sorry . I did n't mean { disfmarker } that one 's an in unintentional . Grad B : So this should be semantic and { disfmarker } Grad F : Sometimes I 'm intentionally inconsistent Grad B :  Grad F : cuz I 'm not sure yet . Here , I actually { disfmarker } it was just a mistake . Grad B : Th - so this definitely should be `` semantic constraints `` down at the bottom ? Grad E : Sure . Grad F : Yeah . Grad B : OK . Grad F : Well , unless I go with `` meaning `` but i I mean , I kind of like `` meaning `` better than `` semantic `` Grad B : Or { disfmarker } Professor C : Oh , whatever . Grad F : but I think there 's { pause } vestiges of other people 's biases . Professor C : Or { disfmarker } wh That - b Grad F : Like { disfmarker } Professor C : Right . Minor { disfmarker } min problem { disfmarker } Grad F : Minor point . Professor C : OK . Grad E : Extremely . Grad F : OK , um , so I think the middle block does n't really give you any more information , ex than the top block . And the bottom block similarly only just illus you know , all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and { disfmarker } and that you can drop the , um { disfmarker } uh , that you can give dual types . Oh , one thing I should mention is about `` designates `` . I think I 'm actually inconsistent across these as well . So , um , strike out the M subscript on the middle block . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad F : So basically now , um , this is actually { disfmarker } this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change , which is that `` designates `` is n't only something for the semantics to worry about now . Professor C : Good . Grad F : So we want s `` designates `` to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects but is sort of , um , really important for say composition later on . So for instance , if some other construction says , you know , `` are you of type { disfmarker } is this part of type whatever `` , um , the `` designates `` tells you which sort of part is the meaning part . OK , so if you have like `` the big red ball `` , you know , you wan na know if there 's an object or a noun . Well , ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase . Grad E : Mmm . Grad F : Um , there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it 's useful sometimes to talk about , um { disfmarker } to talk about there also being a designated object and we think that that 'll be the same one , right ? So the ball is the head of the phrase , `` the r the { disfmarker } `` , um , `` big red ball `` , and the entity denoted by the word `` ball `` is sort of the semantic head in some ways of { disfmarker } of this sort of , um , in interesting larger element . Professor C : A a and the { disfmarker } Yeah . And there 's { disfmarker } uh there 's ca some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head . And { disfmarker } and this enables you to get that , if I understand you right . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Right , right . Grad E : That 's the idea . Professor C : Yeah yeah . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : And , uh , you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head - final language , you can refer to the head as a p the , you know { disfmarker } the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision . Professor C : Right . Grad F : So that 's a useful thing so that you can get some internal structural constraints in . Professor C : OK , so that all looks good . Let me { disfmarker } Oh , w Oh . I do n't know . Were you finished ? Grad F : Um , there was a list of things that is n't included but you { disfmarker } you can { disfmarker } you can ask a question . That might @ @ it . Professor C : OK . So , i if I understand this the { disfmarker } aside from , uh , construed and all that sort of stuff , the { disfmarker } the differences are mainly that , { vocalsound } we 've gone to the possibility of having form - meaning pairs for a type Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : or actually gone back to , Grad F : Right . Professor C : if we go back far enough { disfmarker } Grad F : Well , except for their construction meaning , so it 's not clear that , uh { disfmarker } Well , right now it 's a c uh contr construction type and meaning type . So I do n't know what a form type is . Professor C : Oh , I see . Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'm sorry , you 're right . Grad F : Yeah . Professor C : A construction type . Uh , that 's fine . But it , um { disfmarker } Grad F : Right . A well , and a previous , um , you know , version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning bit by it . So you could say `` construct of type whatever designates something `` . Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : But that was mostly for reference purposes , just to refer to the meaning pole . I do n't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning const type constraint on the meaning , which is really what we want most of the time I think . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Um , I { disfmarker } I do n't know if we 'll ever have a case where we actually h if there is a form category constraint , you could imagine having a triple there that says , you know { disfmarker } that 's kind of weird . Professor C : No , no , no , I do n't think so . I think that you 'll { disfmarker } you 'll do fine . Grad E : I { disfmarker } Professor C : In fact , these are , um , as long as { disfmarker } as Mark is n't around , these are form constraints . So a nominal expression is { disfmarker } uh , the fact that it 's animate , is semantic . The fact that it 's n uh , a nominal expression I would say on most people 's notion of { disfmarker } of f you know , higher form types , this i this is one . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Right , right . Professor C : And I think that 's just fine . Grad E : Yeah , yeah . Grad F : Which is fine , yeah . Professor C : Yeah . Grad E : It 's { disfmarker } that now , um , I 'm mentioned this , I { disfmarker } I do n't know if I ever explained this but the point of , um , I mentioned in the last meeting , { comment } the point of having something called `` nominal expression `` is , um , because it seems like having the verb subcategorize for , you know , like say taking as its object just some expression which , um , designates an object or designates a thing , or whatever , um , that leads to some syntactic problems basically ? So you wan na , you know { disfmarker } you sort of have this problem like `` OK , well , I 'll put the word `` , uh , let 's say , the word `` dog `` , you know . And that has to come right after the verb Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : cuz we know verb meets its object . And then we have a construction that says , oh , you can have `` the `` preceding a noun . And so you 'd have this sort of problem that the verb has to meet the designatum . Professor C : Right . Grad E : And you could get , you know , `` the kicked dog `` or something like that , meaning `` kicked the dog `` . Professor C : Right . Grad E : Um , so you kind of have to let this phrase idea in there Professor C : That I { disfmarker } I have no problem with it at all . Grad E : but { disfmarker } It - it Professor C : I think it 's fine . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Yeah . Right , n s you may be { disfmarker } you may not be like everyone else in { disfmarker } in Berkeley , Grad E : Yeah . Yeah . Grad F : but that 's OK . Grad E : I mean , we { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } we sort of thought we were getting away with , uh { disfmarker } with , a p Grad F : Uh , we do n't mind either , so { disfmarker } Grad E : I mean , this is not reverting to the X - bar theory of { disfmarker } of phrase structure . Professor C : Right . Grad E : But , uh , Grad F : Right . Grad E : I just know that this is { disfmarker } Like , we did n't originally have in mind that , uh { disfmarker } that verbs would subcategorize for a particular sort of form . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : But they do . Grad E : Um , but they does . Grad F : Well , there 's an alternative to this Grad E : At least in English . Grad F : which is , um { disfmarker } The question was did we want directed motion , Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : which is an argument structure construction { disfmarker } Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : did we want it to worry about , um , anything more than the fact that it , you know , has semantic { disfmarker } You know , it 's sort of frame - based construction . So one option that , you know , Keith had mentioned also was like , well if you have more abstract constructions such as subject , predicate , basically things like grammatical relations , Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : those could intersect with these in such a way that subject , predicate , or subject , predicate , subject , verb , ob you know , verb object would require that those things that f fill a subject and object are NOM expressions . Professor C : Right . Grad F : And that would be a little bit cleaner in some way . But you know , for now , I mean , Professor C : Yeah . But it { disfmarker } y y it 's { disfmarker } yeah , just moving it { disfmarker } moving the c the cons the constraints around . Grad F : uh , you know . M moving it to another place , right . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : OK , so that 's { disfmarker } Grad F : But there does { disfmarker } basically , the point is there has to be that constraint somewhere , right ? Professor C : Right . Grad F : So , yeah . Professor C : And so that was the { disfmarker } Grad F : Robert 's not happy now ? Grad A : No ! Grad F : Oh , OK . Professor C : OK , and sort of going with that is that the designatum also now is a pair . Grad F : Yes . Professor C : Instead of just the meaning . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : And that aside from some terminology , that 's basically it . Grad F : Right . Professor C : I just want to b I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm asking . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Yep . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Yeah , um , the un sort of the un - addressed questions in this , um , definitely would for instance be semantic constraints we talked about . Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : Here are just bindings but , right ? we might want to introduce mental spaces { disfmarker } You know , there 's all these things that we do n't { disfmarker } Professor C : The whole { disfmarker } the mental space thing is clearly not here . Grad F : Right ? So there 's going to be some extra { disfmarker } you know , definitely other notation we 'll need for that which we skip for now . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : By the way , I do want to get on that as soon as Robert gets back . Grad F : Uh Yeah . Professor C : So , uh , the { disfmarker } the mental space thing . Grad F : OK . Professor C : Um , obviously , { vocalsound } construal is a b is a b is a big component of that Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : so this probably not worth trying to do anything till he gets back . But sort of as soon as he gets back I think um , we ought to { disfmarker } Grad F : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Grad E : So what 's the { disfmarker } what 's the time frame ? I forgot again when you 're going away for how long ? Grad A : Just , uh , as a { disfmarker } sort of a mental bridge , I 'm not { disfmarker } I 'm skipping fourth of July . So , uh , { vocalsound } right afterwards I 'm back . Grad E : OK . OK . Grad F : What ? You 're missing like the premier American holiday ? What 's the point of spending a year here ? Grad A : Uh , I 've had it often enough . Grad F : So , anyway . Grad B : Well he w he went to college here . Grad F : Oh , yeah , I forgot . Oops . { comment } Sorry . Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : OK . Professor C : And furthermore it 's well worth missing . Grad F : Not in California . Grad E : Yes . Grad F : Yeah , that 's true . I like { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I like spending fourth of July in other countries , { vocalsound } whenever I can . Professor C : Right . Grad F : Um { disfmarker } Professor C : OK , so that 's great . Grad F : Construal , OK , so { disfmarker } Oh , so there was one question that came out . I hate this thing . Sorry . Um , which is , so something like `` past `` which i you know , we think is a very simple { disfmarker } uh , we 've often just stuck it in as a feature , Professor C : Right . Right . Grad F : you know , `` oh , { pause } this event takes place before speech time `` , { comment } OK , is what this means . Um , it 's often thought of as { disfmarker } it is also considered a mental space , Professor C : Right . Grad F : you know , by , you know , lots of people around here . Professor C : Right . Grad F : So there 's this issue of well sometimes there are really exotic explicit space builders that say `` in France , blah - blah - blah `` , Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : and you have to build up { disfmarker } you ha you would imagine that would require you , you know , to be very specific about the machinery , whereas past is a very conventionalized one and we sort of know what it means but it { disfmarker } we does n't { disfmarker } do n't necessarily want to , you know , unload all the notation every time we see that it 's past tense . Professor C : Right . Grad F : So , you know , we could think of our { disfmarker } uh , just like X - schema `` walk `` refers to this complicated structure , past refers to , you know , a certain configuration of this thing with respect to it . Professor C : I think that 's exactly right . Grad F : So { disfmarker } so we 're kind of like having our cake and eating it { disfmarker } Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : you know , having it both ways , right ? Professor C : Yeah . { pause } No , I think { disfmarker } I think that i we 'll have to see how it works out when we do the details Grad F : So , i i Mm - hmm . Professor C : but my intuition would be that that 's right . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Yeah , OK . Grad A : Do you want to do the same for space ? Grad F : Wha - sorry ? Grad A : Space ? Grad F : Space ? Grad A : Here ? Now ? Grad F : Oh , oh , oh , oh , instead of just time ? Grad A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Same thing . So there are very conventionalized like deictic ones , right ? And then I think for other spaces that you introduce , you could just attach y whatever { disfmarker } Grad A : Hmm . Grad F : You could build up an appropriately { disfmarker } uh , appropriate structure according to the l the sentence . Professor C : Yeah . Grad A : Hmm , well this { disfmarker } this basically would involve everything you can imagine to fit under your C dot something { disfmarker } Grad E : N Grad A : you know , where { disfmarker } where it 's contextually dependent , Grad F : Yeah . Right . Grad A : `` what is now , what was past , Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad A : what is in the future , where is this , what is here , what is there , what is { disfmarker } `` Grad F : Mm - hmm . Yeah . So time and space . Um , we 'll { disfmarker } we 'll get that on the other side a little , like very minimally . There 's a sort of there 's a slot for setting time and setting place . Professor C : Good . Grad F : And you know , you could imagine for both of those are absolute things you could say about the time and place , and then there are many in more interestingly , linguistically anyway , { comment } there are relative things that , you know , you relate the event in time and space to where you are now . If there 's something a lot more complicated like , or so { disfmarker } hypothetical or whatever , then you have to do your job , Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : like or somebody 's job anyway . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : I 'm gon na point to { disfmarker } at random . Grad E : Yeah . I mean , I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm s curious about how much of the mental { disfmarker } I mean , I 'm not sure that the formalism , sort of the grammatical side of things , { comment } is gon na have that much going on in terms of the mental space stuff . You know , um , basically all of these so - called space builders that are in the sentence are going to sort of { disfmarker } I think of it as , sort of giving you the coordinates of , you know { disfmarker } assuming that at any point in discourse there 's the possibility that we could be sort of talking about a bunch of different world scenarios , whatever , and the speaker 's supposed to be keeping track of those . The , um { disfmarker } the construction that you actually get is just gon na sort of give you a cue as to which one of those that you 've already got going , um , you 're supposed to add structure to . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : So `` in France , uh , Watergate would n't have hurt Nixon `` or something like that . Um , well , you say , `` alright , I 'm supposed to add some structure to my model of this hypothetical past France universe `` or something like that . The information in the sentence tells you that much but it does n't tell you like exactly what it { disfmarker } what the point of doing so is . So for example , depending on the linguistic con uh , context it could be { disfmarker } like the question is for example , what does `` Watergate `` refer to there ? Does it , you know { disfmarker } does it refer to , um { disfmarker } if you just hear that sentence cold , the assumption is that when you say `` Watergate `` you 're referring to `` a Watergate - like scandal as we might imagine it happening in France `` . But in a different context , `` oh , you know , if Nixon had apologized right away it would n't { disfmarker } you know , Watergate would n't have hurt him so badly in the US and in France it would n't have hurt him at all `` . Now we 're s now that `` Watergate `` { disfmarker } we 're now talking about the real one , Grad F : They 're real , right . Grad E : and the `` would `` sort of { disfmarker } it 's a sort of different dimension of hypothe - theticality , right ? We 're not saying { disfmarker } What 's hypothetical about this world . Grad F : I see { disfmarker } right . Grad E : In the first case , hypothetically we 're imagining that Watergate happened in France . Grad F : Hmm . Grad E : In the second case we 're imagining hypothetically that Nixon had apologized right away Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : or something . Right ? Grad F : Right . Grad E : So a lot of this is n't happening at the grammatical level . Professor C : Correct . Grad E : Uh , um , and so { disfmarker } Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : I do n't know where that sits then , Grad A : Hmm . Grad E : sort of the idea of sorting out what the person meant . Grad F : It seems like , um , the grammatical things such as the auxiliaries that you know introduce these conditionals , whatever , give you sort of the { disfmarker } the most basi Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : th those we { disfmarker } I think we can figure out what the possibilities are , right ? Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : There are sort of a relatively limited number . And then how they interact with some extra thing like `` in France `` or `` if such - and - such `` , that 's like there are certain ways that they c they can { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : You know , one is a more specific version of the general pattern that the grammat grammar gives you . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : I think . But , you know , whatever , Professor C : Yeah , in the short run all we need is a enough mechanism on the form side to get things going . Grad F : we { disfmarker } we 're { disfmarker } Grad E : Mm - hmm . Yeah . Professor C : Uh , I { disfmarker } uh , you { disfmarker } you { disfmarker } Grad E : But the whole point of { disfmarker } the whole point of what Fauconnier and Turner have to say about , uh , mental spaces , and blending , and all that stuff is that you do n't really get that much out of the sentence . You know , there 's not that much information contained in the sentence . It just says , `` Here . Add this structure to this space . `` and exactly what that means for the overall ongoing interpretation is quite open . An individual sentence could mean a hundred different things depending on , quote , `` what the space configuration is at the time of utterance `` . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Grad E : And so somebody 's gon na have to be doing a whole lot of work but not me , I think . Professor C : Well { disfmarker } I think that 's right . Oh , I { disfmarker } yeah , I , uh , uh { disfmarker } I think that 's { disfmarker } Not k I th I do n't think it 's completely right . I mean , in fact a sentence examples you gave in f did constrain the meaning b the form did constrain the meaning , Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : and so , um , it is n't , uh { disfmarker } Grad E : Sure , but like what { disfmarker } what was the point of saying that sentence about Nixon and France ? That is not { disfmarker } there is nothing about that in the { disfmarker } in the sentence really . Grad F : That 's OK . We usually do n't know the point of the sentence at all . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : But we know what it 's trying to say . Professor C : Yeah . Grad E : Y yeah . Grad F : We { disfmarker } we know that it 's { disfmarker } what predication it 's setting up . Professor C : But { disfmarker } but { disfmarker } bottom line , I agree with you , Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : That 's all . Professor C : that { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } that we 're not expecting much out of the , uh f Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Purely linguistic cues , right ? Professor C : uh , the purely form cues , yeah . Grad F : So . Professor C : And , um { disfmarker } I mean , you 're { disfmarker } you 're the linguist Grad F : Mmm . Professor C : but , uh , it seems to me that th these { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } you know , we 've talked about maybe a half a dozen linguistics theses in the last few minutes or something . Grad E : Yeah , yeah . Professor C : Yeah , I mean { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah . Oh , yeah . Professor C : uh , I { disfmarker } I mean , that { disfmarker } that 's my feeling that { disfmarker } that these are really hard uh , problems that decide exactly what { disfmarker } what 's going on . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Professor C : OK . Grad F : OK , so , um , one other thing I just want to point out is there 's a lot of confusion about the terms like `` profile , designate , focus `` , et cetera , et cetera . Professor C : Uh , right , right , right . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Um , for now I 'm gon na say like `` profile `` 's often used { disfmarker } like two uses that come to mind immediately . One is in the traditional like semantic highlight of one element with respect to everything else . So `` hypotenuse `` , you profiled this guy against the background of the { pause } right t right triangle . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : OK . And the second use , um , is in FrameNet . It 's slightly different . Oh , I was asking Hans about this . They use it to really mean , um , this { disfmarker } in a frame th this is { disfmarker } the profiles on the { disfmarker } these are the ones that are required . So they have to be there or expressed in some way . Which { disfmarker } which { disfmarker } I 'm not saying one and two are mutually exclusive but they 're { disfmarker } they 're different meanings . Professor C : Right . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : So the closest thing { disfmarker } so I was thinking about how it relates to this notation . For us , um { disfmarker } OK , so how is it { disfmarker } Professor C : Does that { disfmarker } Is that really what they mean in { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } Grad F : so `` designate `` { disfmarker } FrameNet ? Professor C : I did n't know that . Grad F : FrameNet ? Yeah , yeah . I { disfmarker } I mean , I { disfmarker } I was a little bit surprised about it too . Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : I knew that { disfmarker } I thought that that would be something like { disfmarker } there 's another term that I 've heard for that thing Professor C : Right , OK . Grad F : but they { disfmarker } I mean { disfmarker } uh , well , at least Hans says they use it that way . And { disfmarker } Professor C : Well , I 'll check . Grad F : and may maybe he 's wrong . Anyway , so I think the { disfmarker } the `` designate `` that we have in terms of meaning is really the `` highlight this thing with respect to everything else `` . OK ? Professor C : Right . Grad F : So this is what { disfmarker } what it means . But the second one seems to be useful but we might not need a notation for it ? We do n't have a notation for it but we might want one . So for example we 've talked about if you 're talking about the lexical item `` walk `` , you know it 's an action . Well , it also has this idea { disfmarker } it carries along with it the idea of an actor or somebody 's gon na do the walking . Or if you talk about an adjective `` red `` , it carries along the idea of the thing that has the property of having color red . So we used to use the notation `` with `` for this Professor C : Right . Grad F : and I think that 's closest to their second one . So I d do n't yet know , I have no commitment , as to whether we need it . It might be { disfmarker } it 's the kind of thing that w a parser might want to think about whether we require { disfmarker } you know , these things are like it 's semantically part of it { disfmarker } Professor C : N no , no . Well , uh , th critically they 're not required syntactically . Often they 're pres presu presupposed and all that sort of stuff . Grad F : Right . Right , right . Yeah , um , definitely . So , um , `` in `` was a good example . If you walk `` in `` , like well , in what ? Professor C : Right , there 's { disfmarker } Grad F : You know , like you have to have the { disfmarker } { comment } So { disfmarker } so it 's only semantically is it { disfmarker } it is still required , say , by simulation time though Professor C : Right . Grad F : to have something . So it 's that { disfmarker } I meant the idea of like that { disfmarker } the semantic value is filled in by sim simulation . I do n't know if that 's something we need to spa to { disfmarker } to like say ever as part of the requirement ? { disfmarker } or the construction ? or not . We 'll { disfmarker } we 'll again defer . Professor C : Or { disfmarker } I mean , or { disfmarker } or , uh so the { disfmarker } Grad F : Have it construed , Professor C : Yeah , yeah . Grad F : is that the idea ? Just point at Robert . Whenever I 'm confused just point to him . Professor C : Right . It 's { disfmarker } it 's his thesis , right ? Grad F : You tell me . Professor C : Anyway , Grad F : OK . Professor C : right , yeah , w this is gon na be a b you 're right , this is a bit of in a mess and we still have emphasis as well , or stress , or whatever . Grad F : OK , well we 'll get , uh uh , I { disfmarker } we have thoughts about those as well . Professor C : Yeah . Great . Grad F : Um , the I w I would just s some of this is just like my { disfmarker } you know , by fiat . I 'm going to say , this is how we use these terms . I do n't - you know , there 's lots of different ways in the world that people use it . Professor C : I { disfmarker } that 's fine . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : I think that , um , the other terms that are related are like focus and stress . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad F : So , s I think that the way I { disfmarker } we would like to think , uh , I think is focus is something that comes up in , I mean , lots of { disfmarker } basically this is the information structure . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad F : OK , it 's like { disfmarker } uh , it 's not { disfmarker } it might be that there 's a syntactic , uh , device that you use to indicate focus or that there are things like , you know , I think Keith was telling me , { comment } things toward the end of the sentence , post - verbal , tend to be the focused { disfmarker } focused element , Grad E : Mmm . Grad F : the new information . You know , if I { disfmarker } `` I walked into the room `` , you { disfmarker } tend to think that , whatever , `` into the room `` is sort of like the more focused kind of thing . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Yeah . Grad F : And when you , uh , uh , you have stress on something that might be , you know , a cue that the stressed element , or for instance , the negated element is kind of related to information structure . So that 's like the new { disfmarker } the sort of like import or whatever of { disfmarker } of this thing . Uh , so { disfmarker } so I think that 's kind of nice to keep `` focus `` being an information structure term . `` Stress `` { disfmarker } I th and then there are different kinds of focus that you can bring to it . So , um , like `` stress `` , th stress is kind of a pun on { disfmarker } you might have like { disfmarker } whatever , like , um , accent kind of stress . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : And that 's just a { disfmarker } uh , w we 'll want to distinguish stress as a form device . You know , like , oh , high volume or whatever . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Um , t uh , and distinguish that from it 's effect which is , `` Oh , the kind of focus we have is we 're emphasizing this value often as opposed to other values `` , right ? So focus carries along a scope . Like if you 're gon na focus on this thing and you wan na know { disfmarker } it sort of evokes all the other possibilities that it was n't . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Um , so my classic { disfmarker } my now - classic example of saying , `` Oh , he did go to the meeting ? `` , Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : that was my way of saying { disfmarker } as opposed to , you know , `` Oh , he did n't g `` or `` There was a meeting ? `` Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : I think that was the example that was caught on by the linguists immediately . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : And so , um , the { disfmarker } like if you said he { disfmarker } you know , there 's all these different things that if you put stress on a different part of it then you 're , c focusing , whatever , on , uh { disfmarker } Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : `` he walked to the meeting `` as opposed to `` he ran `` , or `` he did walk to the meeting `` as opposed to `` he did n't walk `` . You know , Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : so we need to have a notation for that which , um , I think that 's still in progress . So , sort of I 'm still working it out . But it did { disfmarker } one { disfmarker } one implication it does f have for the other side , which we 'll get to in a minute is that I could n't think of a good way to say `` here are the possible things that you could focus on `` , cuz it seems like any entity in any sentence , you know , or any meaning component of anyth you know { disfmarker } all the possible meanings you could have , any of them could be the subject of focus . Professor C : Mmm . Grad F : But I think one { disfmarker } the one thing you can schematize is the kind of focus , right ? So for instance , you could say it 's the { disfmarker } the tense on this as opposed to , um , the { disfmarker } the action . OK . Or it 's { disfmarker } uh , it 's an identity thing or a contrast with other things , or stress this value as opposed to other things . So , um , it 's { disfmarker } it is kind of like a profile { disfmarker } profile - background thing but I { disfmarker } I ca n't think of like the limited set of possible meanings that you would { disfmarker } that you would focu Grad E : Light up with focus , yeah . Grad F : light { disfmarker } highlight as opposed to other ones . So it has some certain complications for the , uh , uh { disfmarker } later on . Li - I mean , uh , the best thing I can come up with is that information has a list of focused elements . For instance , you { disfmarker } Oh , one other type that I forgot to mention is like query elements and that 's probably relevant for the like `` where is `` , you know , `` the castle `` kind of thing ? Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Because you might want to say that , um , location or cert certain WH words bring { disfmarker } you know , sort of automatically focus in a , you know , `` I do n't know the identity of this thing `` kind of way on certain elements . So . OK . Anyway . So that 's onl there are { disfmarker } there are many more things that are uncl that are sort of like a little bit unstable about the notation but it 's most { disfmarker } I think it 's { disfmarker } this is , you know , the current { disfmarker } current form . Other things we did n't { vocalsound } totally deal with , um , Grad E : Oh , there 's a bunch . Grad F : well , we 've had a lot of other stuff that Keith and I have them working on in terms of like how you deal with like an adjective . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : You know , a { disfmarker } a nominal expression . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : And , um , I mean , we should have put an example of this and we could do that later . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : But I think the not inherently like the general principles still work though , that , um , we can have constructions that have sort of constituent structure in that there is like , you know , for instance , one { disfmarker } Uh , you know , they { disfmarker } they have constituents , right ? So you can like nest things when you need to , but they can also overlap in a sort of flatter way . So if you do n't have like a lot of grammar experience , then like this { disfmarker } this might , you know , be a little o opaque . But , you know , we have the { pause } properties of dependency grammars and some properties of constituents { disfmarker } constituent - based grammar . So that 's { disfmarker } I think that 's sort of the main thing we wanted to aim for Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : and so far it 's worked out OK . Professor C : Good . Grad F : So . OK . Grad A : I can say two things about the f Grad F : Yes . Grad A : Maybe you want to forget stress . This { disfmarker } my f Grad F : As a word ? Grad A : No , as { disfmarker } as { disfmarker } Just do n't { disfmarker } do n't think about it . Grad F : As a { disfmarker } What 's that ? Grad A : If { disfmarker } Grad F : Sorry . Grad A : canonically speaking you can { disfmarker } if you look at a { disfmarker } a curve over sentence , you can find out where a certain stress is and say , `` hey , that 's my focus exponent . `` Grad E : Right . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad A : It does n't tell you anything what the focus is . If it 's just that thing , Grad F : Mm - hmm . Or the constituent that it falls in . Grad A : a little bit more or the whole phrase . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad A : Um { disfmarker } Grad F : You mean t forget about stress , the form cue ? Grad A : The form bit Grad E : Yeah . Grad A : because , uh , as a form cue , um , not even trained experts can always { disfmarker } well , they can tell you where the focus exponent is sometimes . Grad F : OK . Grad A : And that 's also mostly true for read speech . In { disfmarker } in real speech , um , people may put stress . It 's so d context dependent on what was there before , phrase ba breaks , um , restarts . Grad F : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Grad A : It 's just , um { disfmarker } it 's absurd . It 's complicated . Grad F : OK , Grad A : And all { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah , I mean , I { disfmarker } I 'm sort of inclined to say let 's worry about specifying the information structure focus of the sentence Grad F : I believe you , yeah . Grad E : and then , Grad F : Mm - hmm . Ways that you can get it come from th Grad E : hhh , { comment } the phonology component can handle actually assigning an intonation contour to that . Grad F : right . Grad E : You know , I mean , later on we 'll worry about exactly how { disfmarker } Grad A : Or { disfmarker } or map from the contour to { disfmarker } to what the focus exponent is . Grad E : y Yeah . Exactly . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : But figure out how the { disfmarker } Grad A : But , uh , if you do n't know what you 're { disfmarker } what you 're focus is then you 're { disfmarker } you 're hopeless - uh - ly lost anyways , Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Right . That 's fine , yeah . Mm - hmm . Grad A : and the only way of figuring out what that is , { vocalsound } is , um , by sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element , decide which one in that context makes sense and which one does n't . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad A : And then you 're left with a couple three . So , you know , again , that 's something that h humans can do , Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad A : um , but far outside the scope of { disfmarker } of any { disfmarker } anything . So . You know . It 's { disfmarker } Grad F : OK . Well , uh , yeah , I would n't have assumed that it 's an easy problem in { disfmarker } in absence of all the oth Grad A : u u Grad F : you need all the other information I guess . Grad A : But it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } what it { disfmarker } uh , it 's pretty easy to put it in the formalism , though . I mean , because Grad F : Yeah . Grad A : you can just say whatever stuff , `` i is the container being focused or the { disfmarker } the entire whatever , both , and so forth . `` Grad F : Mm - hmm , mm - hmm . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Yeah . Exactly . So the sort of effect of it is something we want to be able to capture . Professor C : Yeah , so b b but I think the poi I 'm not sure I understand but here 's what I th think is going on . That if we do the constructions right when a particular construction matches , it { disfmarker } the fact that it matches , does in fact specify the focus . Grad F : W uh , I 'm not sure about that . Professor C : OK . Grad F : Or it might limit { disfmarker } it cert certainly constrains the possibilities of focus . Professor C : Uh { disfmarker } k uh , at at the very least it constrai Grad F : I think that 's { disfmarker } that 's , th that 's certainly true . And depending on the construction it may or may not f specify the focus , right ? Professor C : Oh , uh , for sure , yes . There are constrai yeah , it 's not every { disfmarker } but there are constructions , uh , where you t explicitly take into account those considerations Grad F : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Professor C : that you need to take into account in order to decide which { disfmarker } what is being focused . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad A : Mm - hmm . So we talked about that a little bit this morning . `` John is on the bus , not Nancy . `` Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad A : So that 's { disfmarker } focuses on John . Professor C : Right . Grad F : Hmm . Grad A : `` John is on the bus and not on the train . `` Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad A : `` John is on the bus `` versus `` John is on the train . `` Professor C : Right . Grad F : Right . Grad A : And `` John is on the bus `` versus `` was `` , and e Grad F : Is on . `` John is on the bus `` . Yeah . Yeah . Grad A : `` it 's the bu `` so e Professor C : Right . Yeah , all { disfmarker } all of those . Grad A : All of these Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : Right . Grad A : and will we have { disfmarker } u is it all the same constructions ? Just with a different foc focus constituent ? Grad F : Yeah , I would say that argument structure in terms of like the main like sort of , Grad A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : I do n't know { disfmarker } the fact that you can get it without any stress and you have some { disfmarker } whatever is predicated anyway should be the same set of constructions . So that 's why I was talking about overlapping constructions . So , then you have a separate thing that picks out , you know , stress on something relative to everything else . Professor C : Yeah . So , the question is actually { disfmarker } Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : oh , I 'm sorry , Grad F : And it would { disfmarker } Professor C : go ahead , Grad F : yeah , Professor C : finish . Grad F : and it w and that would have to { disfmarker } uh it might be ambiguous as , uh , whether it picks up that element , or the phrase , or something like that . But it 's still is limited possibility . Grad A : Hmm . Grad F : So that should , you know , interact with { disfmarker } it should overlap with whatever other construction is there . Grad A : Yeah . Professor C : S s the question is , do we have a way on the other page , uh , when we get to the s semantic side , of saying what the stressed element was , or stressed phrase , or something . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Well , so that 's why I was saying how { disfmarker } since I could n't think of an easy like limited way of doing it , um , all I can say is that information structure has a focused slot Professor C : Right . Grad F : and I think that should be able to refer to { disfmarker } Professor C : So that 's down at the bottom here when we get over there . OK . Grad F : Yeah , and , infer { disfmarker } and I do n't have { disfmarker } I do n't have a great way or great examples Professor C : I 'll - I 'll wait . OK . Grad F : but I think that { disfmarker } something like that is probably gon na be , uh , more { disfmarker } more what we have to do . Grad A : Hmm . Professor C : OK . Grad F : But , um , Grad A : So Grad F : OK , that was one comment . And you had another one ? Grad A : Yeah , well the { disfmarker } once you know what the focus is the { disfmarker } everything else is background . How about `` topic - comment `` that 's the other side of information . Grad F : How about what ? Grad A : Topic - comment . Grad F : Yeah , so that was the other thing . And so I did n't realize it before . It 's like , `` oh ! `` It was an epiphany that it { disfmarker } you know , topic and focus are a contrast set . So topic is { disfmarker } Topic - focused seems to me like , um , background profile , OK , or a landmark trajector , or some something like that . There 's { disfmarker } there 's definitely , um , that kind of thing going on . Grad A : Mmm . Grad F : Now I do n't know whether { disfmarker } I n I do n't have as many great examples of like topic - indicating constructions on like focus , right ? Um , topic { disfmarker } it seems kind of { disfmarker } you know , I think that might be an ongoing kind of thing . Grad A : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Japanese has this though . You know . Grad F : Topic marker ? Grad A : Yeah . Grad E : Yeah , that 's what `` wa `` is , uh , just to mark which thing is the topic . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : It does n't always have to be the subject . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Right . So again , information structure has a topic slot . And , you know , I stuck it in thinking that we might use it . Grad A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Um , I think I stuck it in . Professor C : Yep , it 's there . Grad F : Um , and one thing that I did n't do consistently , um , is { disfmarker } when we get there , is like indicate what kind of thing fits into every role . I think I have an idea of what it should be but th you know , so far we 've been getting away with like either a type constraint or , um , you know , whatever . I forg it 'll be a frame . You know , it 'll be { disfmarker } it 'll be another predication or it 'll be , um , I do n't know , some value from { disfmarker } from some something , some variable and scope or something like that , or a slot chain based on a variable and scope . OK , so well that 's { disfmarker } should we flip over to the other side officially then ? Grad A : Mm - hmm , hmm . Grad E : OK , side one . Grad F : I keep , uh , like , pointing forward to it . Yeah . Now we 'll go back to s OK , so this does n't include something which mi mi may have some effect on { disfmarker } on it , which is , um , the discourse situation context record , right ? So I did n't { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I meant just like draw a line and like , you know , you also have , uh , some tracking of what was going on . Professor C : Right . Grad F : And sort of { disfmarker } this is a big scale comment before I , you know , look into the details of this . But for instance you could imagine instead of having { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I changed the name of { disfmarker } um it used to be `` entities `` . So you see it 's `` scenario `` , `` referent `` and `` discourse segment `` . And `` scenario `` is essentially what kind of { disfmarker } what 's the basic predication , what event happened . And actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw { disfmarker } draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ? Um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : you know , specific X - schema frames . OK , whatever . The middle thing used to be `` entities `` because you could imagine it should be like really a list where here was various information . And this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent { disfmarker } uh , you know , about some entity that you were going to talk about . So `` Harry walked into the room `` , `` Harry `` and `` room `` , you know , the room { disfmarker } th but they would be represented in this list somehow . And it could also have for instance , it has this category slot . Um , it should be either category or in or instance . Basically , it could be a pointer to ontology . So that everything you know about this could be { disfmarker } could be drawn in . But the important things for grammatical purposes are for { disfmarker } things like number , gender , um { disfmarker } ki the ones I included here are slightly arbitrary but you could imagine that , um , you need to figure out wheth if it 's a group whether , um , some event is happening , linear time , linear spaces , like , you know , are { disfmarker } are they doing something serially or is it like , um , uh I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm not sure . Because this partly came from , uh , Talmy 's schema and I 'm not sure we 'll need all of these actually . But { disfmarker } Um , and then the `` status `` I used was like , again , in some languages , you know , like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status . So , th the { disfmarker } the big com and { disfmarker } and finally `` discourse segment `` is about { vocalsound } sort of speech - act - y information structure - y , like utterance - specific kinds of things . So the comment I was going to make about , um , changing entity { disfmarker } the entity 's block to reference is that { vocalsound } you can imagine your discourse like situation context , you have a set of entities that you 're sort of referring to . And you might { disfmarker } that might be sort of a general , I do n't know , database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to . And I changed to `` reference `` cuz I would say , for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it . And those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here . For instance , I know it 's going to be plural . I know it 's gon na be feminine or something like that . And { disfmarker } and these could actually just point to , you know , the { disfmarker } the ID in my other list of enti active entities , right ? So , um , uh , th there 's { disfmarker } there 's all this stuff about discourse status . We 've talked about . I almost listed `` discourse status `` as a slot where you could say it 's active . You know , there 's this , um , hierarchy { disfmarker } uh there 's a schematization of , you know , things can be active or they can be , um , accessible , inaccessible . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : It was the one that , you know , Keith , um , emailed to us once , to some of us , not all of us . And the thing is that that { disfmarker } I noticed that that , um , list was sort of discourse dependent . It was like in this particular set , s you know , instance , it has been referred to recently or it has n't been , Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : or this is something that 's like in my world knowledge but not active . Professor C : This { disfmarker } Uh { disfmarker } yeah , well there { disfmarker } there seems to be context properties . Grad F : So . Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : Yeah , they 're contex and for instance , I used to have a location thing there but actually that 's a property of the situation . And it 's again , time , you know { disfmarker } at cert certain points things are located , you know , near or far from you Professor C : Well , uh , uh , this is recursive Grad F : and { disfmarker } Professor C : cuz until we do the uh , mental space story , we 're not quite sure { disfmarker } { comment } Th - th Grad F : Yeah . Professor C : which is fine . We 'll just { disfmarker } we 'll j Grad F : Yeah , yeah . So some of these are , uh { disfmarker } Professor C : we just do n't know yet . Grad F : Right . So I { disfmarker } so for now I thought , well maybe I 'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance , right ? Everything else here is utterance - specific . Um , and I left the slot , `` predications `` , open because you can have , um , things like `` the guy I know from school `` . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Or , you know , like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know , predications that you might make . And it 's unclear whether { disfmarker } I mean , you could just have in your scenario , `` here are some extra few things that are true `` , right ? Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : And then you could just sort of not have this slot here . Right ? You 're { disfmarker } but { disfmarker } but it 's used for identification purposes . Professor C : Right . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : So it 's { disfmarker } it 's a little bit different from just saying `` all these things are true from my utterance `` . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Um . Grad E : Right , `` this guy I know from school came for dinner `` does not mean , um , `` there 's a guy , I know him from school , and he came over for dinner `` . That 's not the same effect . Grad F : Yeah , it 's a little bit { disfmarker } it 's a little bit different . Right ? So { disfmarker } Or maybe that 's like a restrictive , non - restrictive { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : you know , it 's like it gets into that kind of thing for { disfmarker } um , but maybe I 'm mixing , you know { disfmarker } this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : So you might imagine that the information you pass to , you know { disfmarker } in identifying a particular referent would be , `` oh , some { disfmarker } `` you know , `` it 's a guy and it 's someone I know from school `` . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : So maybe that would , you know , be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc to the , whatever , construal engine or whatever , discourse context , to find { disfmarker } you know , either create this reference , Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : in which case it 'd be created here , and { disfmarker } you know , so { disfmarker } so you could imagine that this might not { disfmarker } So , uh , I 'm uncommitted to a couple of these things . Grad A : But { disfmarker } to make it m precise at least in my mind , uh , it 's not precise . Grad F : Um . Grad A : So `` house `` is gender neuter ? In reality Grad F : Um , it could be in { disfmarker } Grad A : or in { disfmarker } Professor C : Semantically . Grad A : semantically . Grad F : semantically , yeah . Yeah . Grad A : So { disfmarker } Grad F : So it uh , uh , a table . You know , a thing that c does n't have a gender . So . Uh , it could be that { disfmarker } I mean , maybe you 'd { disfmarker } maybe not all these { disfmarker } I mean , I wou I would say that I tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most { disfmarker } most things . Grad A : No , just to make sure that we { disfmarker } everybody that 's { disfmarker } completely agreed that it { disfmarker } it has nothing to do with , uh , form . Grad F : Yeah . OK , that is semantic as opposed to { disfmarker } Yeah . Yeah . That 's right . Um . Grad A : Then `` predications `` makes sense to { disfmarker } to have it open for something like , uh , accessibility or not . Grad F : S so again { disfmarker } Open to various things . Grad A : Yeah . Grad F : Right . OK , so . Let 's see . So maybe having made that big sca sort of like large scale comment , should I just go through each of these slots { disfmarker } uh , each of these blocks , um , a little bit ? Grad E : Sure . Grad F : Um , mostly the top one is sort of image schematic . And just a note , which was that , um { disfmarker } s so when we actually ha so for instance , um , some of them seem more inherently static , OK , like a container or sort of support - ish . And others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic like `` source , path , goal `` is often thought of that way or `` force `` , or something like that . But in actual fact , I think that they 're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that . And different X - schemas use them in a way that 's either static or dynamic . So `` path `` , you could just be talking about the path between this and this . Grad E : Mmm . Grad F : And you know , `` container `` that you can go in and out . All of these things . And so , um , I think this came up when , uh , Ben and I were working with the Spaniards , um , the other day { disfmarker } the `` Spaniettes `` , as we { vocalsound } called them { disfmarker } um , to decide like how you want to split up , like , s image schematic contributions versus , like , X - schematic contributions . How do you link them up . And I think again , um , it 's gon na be something in the X - schema that tells you `` is this static or is this dynamic `` . So we definitely need { disfmarker } that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that . Um , that , you know , is it , uh , a state or is it a change of state , or is it a , um , action of some kind ? Grad A : Uh , i i i is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you do n't ? Grad F : Uh . Yeah . Grad A : Just means { disfmarker } Grad F : Oh , oh ! You mean , in the slot ? Grad A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Um , no , it 's like X - sc it 's { disfmarker } it 's like I was thinking of type constraints but X - schema , well it obviously has to be an X - schema . `` Agent `` , I mean , the { disfmarker } the performer of the X - schema , that s depends on the X - schema . You know , and I { disfmarker } in general it would probably be , you know { disfmarker } Grad E : So the difference is basically whether you thought it was obvious what the possible fillers were . Grad F : Yeah , basically . Grad A : Mm - hmm . Grad E : OK . Grad F : Um , `` aspectual type `` probably is n't obvious but I should have { disfmarker } So , I just neglected to stick something in . `` Perspective `` , `` actor `` , `` undergoer `` , `` observer `` , um , Grad B : Mmm . Grad F : I think we 've often used `` agent `` , `` patient `` , obser Grad E : `` Whee ! `` That 's that one , right ? Grad F : Yeah , exactly . { vocalsound } Exactly . Um , and so one nice thing that , uh , we had talked about is this example { comment } of like , if you have a passive construction then one thing it does is ch you know { disfmarker } definitely , it is one way to { disfmarker } for you to , you know , specifically take the perspective of the undergoing kind of object . And so then we talked about , you know , whether well , does that specify topic as well ? Well , maybe there are other things . You know , now that it 's { disfmarker } subject is more like a topic . And now that , you know { disfmarker } Anyway . So . Sorry . I 'm gon na trail off on that one cuz it 's not that f important right now . Professor C : N now , for the moment we just need the ability to l l write it down if { disfmarker } if somebody figured out what the rules were . Grad F : Um , To know how { disfmarker } Yeah . Yeah . Exactly . Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : Um , some of these other ones , let 's see . So , uh , one thing I 'm uncertain about is how polarity interacts . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad F : So polarity , uh , is using for like action did not take place for instance . So by default it 'll be like `` true `` , I guess , you know , if you 're specifying events that did happen . You could imagine that you skip out this { disfmarker } you know , leave off this polarity , you know , not { disfmarker } do n't have it here . And then have it part of the speech - act in some way . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad F : There 's some negation . But the reason why I left it in is cuz you might have a change of state , let 's say , where some state holds and then some state does n't hold , and you 're just talking , you know { disfmarker } if you 're trying to have the nuts and bolts of simulation you need to know that , you know , whatever , the holder does n't and { disfmarker } Professor C : No , I th I think at this lev which is { disfmarker } it should be where you have it . Grad F : OK , it 's { disfmarker } so it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } it 's fine where it is . Professor C : I mean , how you get it may { disfmarker } may in will often involve the discourse Grad F : So , OK . May come from a few places . Professor C : but { disfmarker } but { disfmarker } by the time you 're simulating you sh y you should know that . Grad F : Right . Right . Grad E : So , { vocalsound } I 'm still just really not clear on what I 'm looking at . The `` scenario `` box , like , what does that look like for an example ? Like , not all of these things are gon na be here . Grad F : Yeah . Professor C : Correct . Grad E : This is just basically says Grad F : Mm - hmm . It 's a grab bag of { disfmarker } Grad E : `` part of what I 'm going to hand you is a whole bunch of s uh , schemas , image , and X - schemas . Here are some examples of the sorts of things you might have in there `` . Grad F : So that 's exactly what it is . Grad E : OK . Grad F : And for a particular instance which I will , you know , make an example of something , is that you might have an instance of container and path , let 's say , as part of your , you know , `` into `` you know , definition . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Grad F : So you would eventually have instances filled in with various { disfmarker } various values for all the different slots . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : And they 're bound up in , you know , their bindings and { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and values . Professor C : W it c Grad E : OK . Do you have to say about the binding in your { disfmarker } is there a slot in here for { disfmarker } that tells you how the bindings are done ? Professor C : No , no , no . I { disfmarker } let 's see , I think we 're { disfmarker } we 're not { disfmarker } I do n't think we have it quite right yet . So , uh , what this is , Grad E : OK . Professor C : let 's suppose for the moment it 's complete . OK , uh , then this says that when an analysis is finished , the whole analysis is finished , { comment } you 'll have as a result , uh , some s resulting s semspec for that utterance in context , Grad E : OK . Mm - hmm . Professor C : which is made up entirely of these things and , uh , bindings among them . And bindings to ontology items . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : So that { disfmarker } that the who that this is the tool kit under whi out of which you can make a semantic specification . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor C : So that 's A . But B , which is more relevant to your life , is this is also the tool kit that is used in the semantic side of constructions . Grad E : OK . Mm - hmm . Professor C : So this is an that anything you have , in the party line , { comment } anything you have as the semantic side of constructions comes , from pieces of this { disfmarker } ignoring li Grad E : OK . Professor C : I mean , in general , you ignore lots of it . Grad E : Right . Professor C : But it 's got to be pieces of this along with constraints among them . Grad E : OK . Professor C : Uh , so that the , you know , goal of the , uh uh , `` source , path , goal `` has to be the landmark of the conta you know , the interior of this container . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Or whate whatever . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : So those constraints appear in constructions Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : but pretty much this is the full range of semantic structures available to you . Grad E : OK . Grad F : Except for `` cause `` , that I forgot . But anyway , there 's som some kind of causal structure for composite events . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : OK , good . Let 's { disfmarker } let 's mark that . So we need a c Grad F : Uh , I mean , so it gets a little funny . These are all { disfmarker } so far these structures , especially from `` path `` and on down , these are sort of relatively familiar , um , image schematic kind of slots . Now with `` cause `` , uh , the fillers will actually be themselves frames . Right ? Professor C : Right . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : So you 'll say , `` event one causes event B { disfmarker } Professor C : And { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and this { disfmarker } this { disfmarker } this again may ge our , um { disfmarker } and we { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and , of course , worlds . Grad F : uh , event two `` , and { disfmarker } Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Yeah . So that 's , uh these are all implicitly one { disfmarker } within , uh within one world . Um , even though saying that place takes place , whatever . Uh , if y if I said `` time `` is , you know , `` past `` , that would say `` set that this world `` , you know , `` somewhere , before the world that corresponds to our current speech time `` . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Grad F : So . But that { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } that 's sort of OK . The { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } within the event it 's st it 's still one world . Um . Yeah , so `` cause `` and { disfmarker } Other frames that could come in { disfmarker } I mean , unfortunately you could bring in say for instance , um , uh , `` desire `` or something like that , Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : like `` want `` . And actually there is right now under `` discourse segments `` , um , `` attitude `` ? Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : `` Volition `` ? could fill that . So there are a couple things where I like , `` oh , I 'm not sure if I wanted to have it there Grad E : Well that 's { disfmarker } Grad F : or { disfmarker } `` Basically there was a whole list of { disfmarker } of possible speaker attitudes that like say Talmy listed . And , like , well , I do n't { disfmarker } you know , it was like `` hope , wish . desire `` , Professor C : Right . Grad E : Uh - huh . Grad F : blah - blah - blah . And it 's like , well , I feel like if I wanted to have an extra meaning { disfmarker } I do n't know if those are grammatically marked in the first place . So { disfmarker } They 're more lexically marked , right ? Grad E : Mmm . Grad F : At least in English . So if I wanted to I would stick in an extra frame in my meaning , saying , e so th it 'd be a hierarchical frame them , right ? You know , like `` Naomi wants { disfmarker } wants su a certain situation and that situation itself is a state of affairs `` . Professor C : S right . So { disfmarker } so , `` want `` itself can be { disfmarker } { pause } i i i i i Grad F : u Can be just another frame that 's part of your { disfmarker } Professor C : Well , and it i basically it 's an action . In { disfmarker } in our s in our { disfmarker } in our { disfmarker } Grad F : Yeah . Situation . { comment } Right , right . Professor C : in { disfmarker } in our { disfmarker } in our s terminology , `` want `` can be an action and `` what you want `` is a world . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad B : Hmm . Professor C : So that 's { disfmarker } I mean , it 's certainly one way to do it . Grad F : Mmm . Professor C : Yeah , there { disfmarker } there are other things . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Causal stuff we absolutely need . Mental space we need . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : The context we need . Um , so anyway , Keith { disfmarker } So is this comfortable to you that , uh , once we have this defined , it is your tool kit for building the semantic part of constructions . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : And then when we combine constructions semantically , the goal is going to be to fill out more and more of the bindings needed in order to come up with the final one . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : And that 's the wh and { disfmarker } and I mean , that { disfmarker } according to the party line , that 's the whole story . Grad E : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Um . y Right . That makes sense . So I mean , there 's this stuff in the { disfmarker } off in the scenario , which just tells you how various { disfmarker } what schemas you 're using and they 're { disfmarker } how they 're bound together . And I guess that some of the discourse segment stuff { disfmarker } is that where you would sa Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : I mean , that 's { disfmarker } OK , that 's where the information structure is which sort of is a kind of profiling on different parts of , um , of this . Grad F : Right . Exactly . Grad E : I mean , what 's interesting is that the information structure stuff { disfmarker } Hmm . There 's almost { disfmarker } I mean , we keep coming back to how focus is like this { disfmarker } this , uh , trajector - landmark thing . Grad F : Yeah . Grad E : So if I say , um , You know , `` In France it 's like this `` . You know , great , we 've learned something about France but the fact is that utterances of that sort are generally used to help you draw a conclusion also about some implicit contrast , like `` In France it 's like this `` . And therefore you 're supposed to say , `` Boy , life sure { disfmarker } `` Grad F : Right . Grad E : You know , `` in France kids are allowed to drink at age three `` . And w you 're { disfmarker } that 's not just a fact about France . You also conclude something about how boring it is here in the U S . Right ? Grad F : Right , right . Professor C : Right . Grad E : And so { disfmarker } Grad F : S so I would prefer not to worry about that for right now Grad E : OK . Grad F : and to think that there are , um , Grad E : That comes in and , uh { disfmarker } Grad F : discourse level constructions in a sense , topic { disfmarker } topic - focus constructions that would say , `` oh , when you focus something `` then { disfmarker } Grad E : Mm - hmm . Yeah . Grad F : just done the same way { disfmarker } just actually in the same way as the lower level . If you stressed , you know , `` John went to the { disfmarker } `` , you know , `` the bar `` whatever , you 're focusing that Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : and a in a possible inference is `` in contrast to other things `` . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : So similarly for a whole sentence , you know , `` in France such - and - such happens `` . Grad E : Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Grad F : So the whole thing is sort of like again implicitly as opposed to other things that are possible . Grad E : Yeah . Grad A : Uh , just { disfmarker } just , uh , look { disfmarker } read uh even sem semi formal Mats Rooth . Grad F : I mean { disfmarker } Yeah . Grad A : If you have n't read it . It 's nice . Grad F : Uh - huh . Grad A : And just pick any paper on alternative semantics . Grad F : Uh - huh . Grad E : OK . Grad A : So that 's his { disfmarker } that 's the best way of talking about focus , is I think his way . Grad E : OK , what was the name ? Grad A : Mats . MATS . Rooth . Grad E : OK . Grad A : I think two O 's , yes , TH . Grad E : OK . Grad A : I never know how to pronounce his name because he 's sort of , Professor C : S Swede ? Grad A : uh , he is Dutch Professor C : Dutch ? Grad A : and , um { disfmarker } but very confused background I think . Professor C : Oh , Dutch . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : Uh - huh . Grad A : So { pause } and , um , Grad E : Mats Gould . Grad A : And sadly enough he also just left the IMS in Stuttgart . So he 's not there anymore . Grad E : Hmm . Grad A : But , um { disfmarker } I do n't know where he is right now but alternative semantics is { disfmarker } if you type that into an , uh , uh , browser or search engine you 'll get tons of stuff . Grad E : OK . OK . OK , thanks . Grad A : And what I 'm kind of confused about is { disfmarker } is what the speaker and the hearer is { disfmarker } is sort of doing there . Grad F : So for a particular segment it 's really just a reference to some other entity again in the situation , right ? So for a particular segment the speaker might be you or might be me . Grad A : Yeah . Grad F : Um , hearer is a little bit harder . It could be like multiple people . I guess that { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } that 's not very clear from here { disfmarker } Grad A : Yeah , but you { disfmarker } Do n't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place , Grad F : I mean , that 's not allowed here . Grad A : because `` you `` , `` me `` , `` he `` , `` they `` , you know , `` these guys `` , all these expressions , nuh , are in { disfmarker } in much the same way contextually dependent as `` here , `` and `` now , `` and `` there `` { disfmarker } Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Now , this is { disfmarker } this is assuming you 've already solved that . Grad F : Ye - yeah . Professor C : So it 's { disfmarker } it 's Fred and Mary , Grad F : So th Professor C : so the speaker would be Fred and the { disfmarker } Grad A : Ah ! Grad F : Right , so the constructions might { disfmarker } of course will refer , using pronouns or whatever . Grad A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : In which case they have to check to see , uh , who the , uh , speaker in here wa in order to resolve those . But when you actually say that `` he walked into { disfmarker } `` , whatever , um , the `` he `` will refer to a particular { disfmarker } You { disfmarker } you will already have figured who `` he `` or `` you `` , mmm , or `` I `` , maybe is a bett better example , who `` I `` refers to . Um , and then you 'd just be able to refer to Harry , you know , in wherever that person { disfmarker } whatever role that person was playing in the event . Grad A : Mmm . That 's up at the reference part . Grad F : Yeah , yeah . Grad A : And down there in the speaker - hearer part ? Grad F : S so , that 's { disfmarker } I think that 's just { disfmarker } n for instance , Speaker is known from the situation , right ? You 're { disfmarker } when you hear something you 're told who the speaker is { disfmarker } I mean , you know who the speaker is . In fact , that 's kind of constraining how { disfmarker } in some ways you know this before you get to the { disfmarker } you fill in all the rest of it . I think . Professor C : Mmm . Grad F : I mean , how else would you um { disfmarker } Grad A : You know , uh , uh , it 's { disfmarker } the speaker may { disfmarker } in English is allowed to say `` I . `` Professor C : Yeah . Well , here { disfmarker } Grad A : Uh , among the twenty - five percent most used words . Grad F : Yeah . Right . Grad A : But would n't the `` I `` then set up the { disfmarker } the s s referent { disfmarker } that happens to be the speaker this time Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad A : and not `` they , `` whoever they are . Grad F : Right , right . Grad A : Or `` you `` { disfmarker } Grad F : So { disfmarker } Grad A : much like the `` you `` could n Grad F : S so { disfmarker } OK , so I would say ref under referent should be something that corresponds to `` I `` . And maybe each referent should probably have a list of way whatever , the way it was referred to . So that 's `` I `` but , uh , uh , should we say it { disfmarker } it refers to , what ? Uh , if it were `` Harry `` it would refer to like some ontology thing . If it were { disfmarker } if it 's `` I `` it would refer to the current speaker , OK , which is given to be like , you know , whoever it is . Grad A : Well , not { disfmarker } not always . I mean , so there 's `` and then he said , I w `` Uh - huh . Professor C : Uh { disfmarker } Grad F : `` I `` within the current world . Grad A : Yeah . Professor C : Yeah . That 's right . So { disfmarker } so again , this { disfmarker } uh , this { disfmarker } this is gon na to get us into the mental space stuff Grad F : Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Professor C : and t because you know , `` Fred said that Mary said { disfmarker } `` , and whatever . Grad E : Mmm . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : And { disfmarker } and so we 're , uh gon na have to , um , chain those as well . Grad A : Mm - hmm . Twhhh - whhh . But { disfmarker } Grad F : Mm - hmm . So this entire thing is inside a world , Professor C : Right . Right . Grad F : not just like the top part . Professor C : I { disfmarker } I think , uh { disfmarker } Grad F : That 's { disfmarker } Grad A : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Except s it 's { disfmarker } it 's trickier than that because um , the reference for example { disfmarker } So he where it gets really tricky is there 's some things , Grad F : Yeah . Professor C : and this is where blends and all terribl So , some things which really are meant to be identified and some things which are n't . Grad F : Yeah . Right . Professor C : And again , all we need for the moment is some way to say that . Grad F : Right . So I thought of having like { disfmarker } for each referent , having the list of { disfmarker } of the things t with which it is identified . You know , which { disfmarker } which , uh you know , you { disfmarker } you { disfmarker } you { disfmarker } Professor C : You could do that . Grad F : for instance , um { disfmarker } So , I guess , it sort of depends on if it is a referring exp if it 's identifiable already or it 's a new thing . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : If it 's a new thing you 'd have to like create a structure or whatever . If it 's an old thing it could be referring to , um , usually w something in a situation , right ? Or something in ontology . Professor C : uh - huh . Grad F : So , there 's a you know , whatever , it c it could point at one of these . Professor C : I just had a { disfmarker } I just had an { disfmarker } an idea that would be very nice if it works . Grad F : For what ? Professor C : Uh , uh , uh , I have n't told you what it is yet . Grad F : If it works . Professor C : This was my build - up . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Mmm . Professor C : An i an idea that would be nice i Grad F : Yeah . OK , we 're crossing our fingers . Professor C : Right . Grad B : So we 're building a mental space , good . Professor C : If it worked . Yeah . Grad F : OK . Professor C : Right , it was a space builder . Um , we might be able to handle context in the same way that we handle mental spaces because , uh , you have somewhat the same things going on of , uh , things being accessible or not . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : And so , i Grad F : Yep . Professor C : it c it { disfmarker } it , uh I think if we did it right we might be able to get at least a lot of the same structure . Grad F : Use the same { disfmarker } { comment } Yep . Professor C : So that pulling something out of a discourse context is I think similar to other kinds of , uh , mental space phenomena . Grad B : I see . Grad F : Mm - hmm . And { disfmarker } And { disfmarker } Professor C : Uh , I 've { disfmarker } I 've { disfmarker } I 've never seen anybody write that up but maybe they did . I do n't know . That may be all over the literature . Grad F : Yeah . Grad E : There 's things like ther you know , there 's all kinds of stuff like , um , in { disfmarker } I think I mentioned last time in Czech if you have a { disfmarker } a verb of saying then Grad F : So { disfmarker } so by default { disfmarker } Grad E : um , you know , you say something like { disfmarker } or { disfmarker } or I was thinking you can say something like , `` oh , I thought , uh , you are a republican `` or something like that . Where as in English you would say , `` I thought you were `` . Professor C : Right . Grad E : Um , you know , sort of the past tense being copied onto the lower verb does n't happen there , so you have to say something about , you know , tense is determined relative to current blah - blah - blah . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Same things happens with pronouns . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : There 's languages where , um , if you have a verb of saying then , ehhh , where { disfmarker } OK , so a situation like `` Bob said he was going to the movies `` , where that lower subject is the same as the person who was saying or thinking , you 're actually required to have `` I `` there . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Um , and it 's sort of in an extended function { disfmarker } Professor C : So we would have it be in quotes in English . Grad E : Yeah . Grad B : Right . Grad E : But it 's not perceived as a quotative construction . Grad F : Right . Professor C : Yeah . Grad E : I mean , it 's been analyzed by the formalists as being a logophoric pronoun , um which means a pronoun which refers back to the person who is speaking or that sort of thing , right ? Professor C : OK . Grad F : Oh , right . Yeah , that makes sense . Grad E : Um , but { disfmarker } uh , that happens to sound like the word for `` I `` but is actually semantically unrelated to it . Grad F : Oh , no ! Professor C : Oh , good , I love the formali Grad E : Um , Grad F : Really ? Grad E : Yeah . { vocalsound } Yeah . Grad F : You 're kidding . Grad E : There 's a whole book which basically operates on this assumption . Uh , Mary Dalrymple , uh , this book , a ninety - three book on , uh on pronoun stuff . Grad F : No , that 's horrible . OK . That 's horrible . { comment } OK . Grad E : Well , yeah . And then the same thing for ASL where , you know , you 're signing and someone says something . And then , you know , so `` he say `` , and then you sort of do a role shift . And then you sign `` I , this , that , and the other `` . Grad F : Uh - huh . Grad E : And you know , `` I did this `` . That 's also been analyzed as logophoric and having nothing to do with `` I `` . And the role shift thing is completely left out and so on . So , I mean , the point is that pronoun references , uh , you know , sort of ties in with all this mental space stuff and so on , and so forth . Grad F : Uh - huh . Grad E : And so , yeah , I mean { disfmarker } Grad F : Yeah . Professor C : So that { disfmarker } that d that does sound like it 's co consistent with what we 're saying , yeah . Grad E : Right . Yeah . Grad F : OK , so it 's kind of like the unspecified mental spaces just are occurring in context . And then when you embed them sometimes you have to pop up to the h you know , depending on the construction or the whatever , um , you { disfmarker } you { disfmarker } you 're scope is { disfmarker } m might extend out to the { disfmarker } the base one . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : It would be nice to actually use the same , um , mechanism since there are so many cases where you actually need it 'll be one or the other . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : It 's like , oh , actually , it 's the same { disfmarker } same operation . Professor C : Oh , OK , so this { disfmarker } this is worth some thought . Grad F : So . Grad E : It 's like { disfmarker } it 's like what 's happening { disfmarker } that , yeah , what what 's happening , uh , there is that you 're moving the base space or something like that , right ? Grad F : Yeah , yeah . Grad E : So that 's { disfmarker } that 's how Fauconnier would talk about it . And it happens diff under different circumstances in different languages . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : And so , Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : um , things like pronoun reference and tense which we 're thinking of as being these discourse - y things actually are relative to a Bayes space which can change . Grad F : Mm - hmm , Grad E : And we need all the same machinery . Grad F : right . Grad A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Robert . Professor C : Well , but , uh , this is very good actually Grad E : Schade . Professor C : cuz it { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } to the extent that it works , it y Grad F : Ties it all into it . Professor C : it { disfmarker } it ties together several of { disfmarker } of these things . Grad F : Yeah . Yep . Grad A : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . And I 'm sure gon na read the transcript of this one . So . But the , uh , { disfmarker } { vocalsound } But it 's too bad that we do n't have a camera . You know , all the pointing is gon na be lost . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Oh , yeah . Grad B : Well every time Nancy giggles it means { disfmarker } it means that it 's your job . Grad F : Yeah , that 's why I said `` point to Robert `` , { vocalsound } when I did it . Grad A : Uh . Yeah . Mmm , is n't { disfmarker } I mean , I 'm { disfmarker } I was sort of dubious why { disfmarker } why he even introduces this sort of reality , you know , as your basic mental space and then builds up { disfmarker } Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad A : d does n't start with some { disfmarker } because it 's so obvi it should be so obvious , at least it is to me , { comment } that whenever I say something I could preface that with `` I think . `` Nuh ? Grad E : Yeah . Grad A : So there should be no categorical difference between your base and all the others that ensue . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : No , but there 's { disfmarker } there 's a Gricean thing going on there , that when you say `` I think `` you 're actually hedging . Grad E : Yeah , I mean { disfmarker } Grad F : Mmm . It 's like I do n't totally think { disfmarker } Professor C : Right . Grad E : Yeah . Y Grad F : I mostly think , uh { disfmarker } Grad A : Yeah , it 's { disfmarker } Absolutely . Grad E : Yeah , it 's an { disfmarker } it 's an evidential . It 's sort of semi - grammaticalized . People have talked about it this way . And you know , you can do sort of special things . You can , th put just the phrase `` I think `` as a parenthetical in the middle of a sentence and so on , and so forth . Grad A : Yeah . Grad E : So { disfmarker } Grad F : Actually one of the child language researchers who works with T Tomasello studied a bunch of these constructions and it was like it 's not using any kind of interesting embedded ways just to mark , you know , uncertainty or something like that . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : So . Grad A : Yeah , but about linguistic hedges , I mean , those { disfmarker } those tend to be , um , funky anyways because they blur { disfmarker } Professor C : So we do n't have that in here either do we ? Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Hedges ? Professor C : Yeah , yeah . Grad F : Hhh , { comment } I { disfmarker } there used to be a slot for speaker , um , it was something like factivity . I could n't really remember what it meant Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : so I took it out . Grad E : Um . Grad F : But it 's something { disfmarker } Grad E : Well we were just talking about this sort of evidentiality and stuff like that , right ? Grad F : we { disfmarker } we were talking about sarcasm too , right ? Oh , oh . Grad E : I mean , Grad F : Oh , yeah , yeah , right . Grad E : that 's what I think is , um , sort of telling you what percent reality you should give this Professor C : So we probably should . Grad F : Yeah . Grad A : Mm - hmm . Grad E : or the , you know { disfmarker } Professor C : Confidence or something like that . Grad E : Yeah , and the fact that I 'm , you know { disfmarker } the fact maybe if I think it versus he thinks that might , you know , depending on how much you trust the two of us or whatever , Grad F : Yeah . Grad A : Uh great word in the English language is called `` about `` . Grad E : you know { disfmarker } Grad A : If you study how people use that it 's also { disfmarker } Grad F : What 's the word ? Grad A : `` about . `` It 's about { disfmarker } Professor C : About . Grad A : clever . Professor C : Oh , that { disfmarker } in that use of `` about `` , yeah . Grad F : Oh , oh , oh , as a hedge . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : And I think { disfmarker } And I think { pause } y if you want us to spend a pleasant six or seven hours you could get George started on that . Grad E : He wrote a paper about thirty - five years ago on that one . Grad B : I r I read that paper , Professor C : Yeah . Grad B : the hedges paper ? I read some of that paper actually . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : Yeah . Grad E : Would you believe that that paper lead directly to the development of anti - lock brakes ? Grad F : What ? Professor C : No . Grad E : Ask me about it later I 'll tell you how . When we 're not on tape . Grad F : I 'd love to know . Grad B : Oh , man . Grad F : So , and { disfmarker } and I think , uh , someone had raised like sarcasm as a complication at some point . Professor C : There 's all that stuff . Yeah , let 's { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I do n't { disfmarker } I think { disfmarker } Grad F : And we just wo n't deal with sarcastic people . Professor C : Yeah , I mean { disfmarker } Grad E : I do n't really know what like { disfmarker } We { disfmarker } we do n't have to care too much about the speaker attitude , right ? Like there 's not so many different { disfmarker } hhh , { comment } I do n't know , m Grad F : Certainly not as some { disfmarker } Well , they 're intonational markers I think for the most part . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : I do n't know too much about the like grammatical { disfmarker } Grad E : I just mean { disfmarker } There 's lots of different attitudes that { disfmarker } that the speaker could have and that we can clearly identify , and so on , and so forth . Grad F : Yeah . Grad E : But like what are the distinctions among those that we actually care about for our current purposes ? Professor C : Right . Right , so , uh , this { disfmarker } this raises the question of what are our current purposes . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Right ? Grad E : Oh , shoot . Grad F : Oh , yeah , do we have any ? Grad E : Here it is three - fifteen already . Grad A : Mmm . Yeah . Professor C : Uh , so , um , I { disfmarker } I do n't know the answer but { disfmarker } but , um , it does seem that , you know , this is { disfmarker } this is coming along . I think it 's { disfmarker } it 's converging . It 's { disfmarker } as far as I can tell there 's this one major thing we have to do which is the mental { disfmarker } the whole s mental space thing . And then there 's some other minor things . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Um , and we 're going to have to s sort of bound the complexity . I mean , if we get everything that anybody ever thought about you know , w we 'll go nuts . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : So we had started with the idea that the actual , uh , constraint was related to this tourist domain and the kinds of interactions that might occur in the tourist domain , assuming that people were being helpful and were n't trying to d you know , there 's all sorts of { disfmarker } God knows , irony , and stuff like { disfmarker } which you { disfmarker } is n't probably of much use in dealing with a tourist guide . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : Yeah ? Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : Uh . Grad F : M mockery . Professor C : Right . Whatever . So y uh , no end of things th that { disfmarker } that , you know , we do n't deal with . Grad A : But it { disfmarker } Professor C : And { disfmarker } Grad A : i is n't that part easy though Professor C : Go ahead . Grad A : because in terms of the s simspec , it would just mean you put one more set of brack brackets around it , and then just tell it to sort of negate whatever the content of that is in terms of irony Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : N no . Grad F : Mmm . Grad A : or { disfmarker } Professor C : No . Grad E : Right . Grad F : Maybe . Professor C : No . Grad F : Yeah , in model theory cuz the semantics is always like `` speaker believes not - P `` , you know ? Professor C : Right . Grad F : Like `` the speaker says P and believes not - P `` . Grad E : We have a theoretical model of sarcasm now . Grad F : But { disfmarker } Professor C : Right . Grad E : Yeah , right , I mean . Professor C : No , no . Grad F : Right , right , but , Professor C : Anyway , so { disfmarker } so , um , I guess uh , let me make a proposal on how to proceed on that , which is that , um , it was Keith 's , uh , sort of job over the summer to come up with this set of constructions . Uh , and my suggestion to Keith is that you , over the next couple weeks , n Grad E : Mmm . Professor C : do n't try to do them in detail or formally but just try to describe which ones you think we ought to have . Grad E : OK . Professor C : Uh , and then when Robert gets back we 'll look at the set of them . Grad E : OK . Professor C : Just { disfmarker } just sort of , you know , define your space . Grad E : Yeah , OK . Professor C : And , um , so th these are { disfmarker } this is a set of things that I think we ought to deal with . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : And then we 'll { disfmarker } we 'll { disfmarker } we 'll go back over it and w people will { disfmarker } will give feedback on it . Grad E : OK . Professor C : And then { disfmarker } then we 'll have a { disfmarker } at least initial spec of { disfmarker } of what we 're actually trying to do . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : And that 'll also be useful for anybody who 's trying to write a parser . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Knowing uh { disfmarker } Grad E : In case there 's any around . Grad F : If we knew anybody like that . Professor C : Right , `` who might want `` et cetera . So , uh { disfmarker } Grad E : OK . Professor C : So a and we get this { disfmarker } this , uh , portals fixed and then we have an idea of the sort of initial range . And then of course Nancy you 're gon na have to , uh , do your set of { disfmarker } but you have to do that anyway . Grad F : For the same , yeah , data . Yeah , mm - hmm . Professor C : So { disfmarker } so we 're gon na get the w we 're basically dealing with two domains , the tourist domain and the { disfmarker } and the child language learning . Grad B : Mmm . Professor C : And we 'll see what we need for those two . And then my proposal would be to , um , not totally cut off more general discussion but to focus really detailed work on the subset of things that we 've { disfmarker } we really want to get done . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : And then as a kind of separate thread , think about the more general things and { disfmarker } and all that . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Grad A : Well , I also think the detailed discussion will hit { disfmarker } you know , bring us to problems that are of a general nature and maybe even { disfmarker } Professor C : Uh , without doubt . Yeah . Grad F : Yeah . Grad A : even suggest some solutions . Professor C : But what I want to do is { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } is to { disfmarker } to constrain the things that we really feel responsible for . Grad A : Yeah . Mmm . Professor C : So that { disfmarker } that we say these are the things we 're really gon na try do by the end of the summer Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : and other things we 'll put on a list of { disfmarker } of research problems or something , because you can easily get to the point where nothing gets done because every time you start to do something you say , `` oh , yeah , but what about this case ? `` Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : This is { disfmarker } this is called being a linguist . Grad A : Mmm . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : And , uh , Grad E : Basically . Grad F : Or me . Professor C : Huh ? Grad F : Or me . Anyways { disfmarker } Grad B : There 's that quote in Jurafsky and Martin where { disfmarker } where it goes { disfmarker } where some guy goes , `` every time I fire a linguist the performance of the recognizer goes up . `` Professor C : Right . Grad F : Yeah . Grad E : Exactly . Professor C : Right . But anyway . So , is { disfmarker } is that { disfmarker } does that make sense as a , uh { disfmarker } a general way to proceed ? Grad F : Sure , yeah . Grad E : Yeah , yeah , we 'll start with that , just figuring out what needs to be done then actually the next step is to start trying to do it . Professor C : Exactly right . Grad A : Mmm . Grad E : Got it . Grad A : Mmm . Grad E : OK . Grad A : We have a little bit of news , uh , just minor stuff . The one big { disfmarker } Grad B : Ooo , can I ask a { disfmarker } Grad E : You ran out of power . Grad A : Huh ? Grad B : Can I ask a quick question about this side ? Grad A : Yeah . Grad F : Yes . Grad B : Is this , uh { disfmarker } was it intentional to leave off things like `` inherits `` and { disfmarker } Grad F : Oops . Um , Grad E : No . Grad F : not really { disfmarker } just on the constructions , right ? Grad B : Yeah , like constructions can inherit from other things , Grad F : Um , Grad B : am I right ? Grad F : yeah . Grad B : Yeah . Grad F : I did n't want to think too much about that for { disfmarker } for now . Grad B : OK . Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : So , uh , maybe it was subconsciously intentional . Professor C : Yeah , uh { disfmarker } yeah . Grad E : Um , yeah , there should be { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I wanted to s find out someday if there was gon na be some way of dealing with , uh , if this is the right term , multiple inheritance , Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad E : where one construction is inheriting from , uh from both parents , Grad F : Uh - huh . Yep . Grad E : uh , or different ones , or three or four different ones . Professor C : Yeah . So let me { disfmarker } Grad E : Cuz the problem is that then you have to { disfmarker } Grad F : Yeah . Grad E : which of { disfmarker } you know , which are { disfmarker } how they 're getting bound together . Grad F : Refer to { pause } them . Professor C : Yeah , right , right , right . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Grad F : Yeah , and { disfmarker } and there are certainly cases like that . Even with just semantic schemas we have some examples . Professor C : Right . Grad F : So , and we 've been talking a little bit about that anyway . Professor C : Yeah . So what I would like to do is separate that problem out . Grad F : Inherits . Professor C : So um , Grad E : OK . Professor C : my argument is there 's nothing you can do with that that you ca n't do by just having more constructions . Grad E : Yeah , yes . Professor C : It 's uglier and it d does n't have the deep linguistic insights and stuff . Grad E : That 's right . Professor C : Uh , Grad E : But whatever . Professor C : Right . Grad E : Yeah , no , no , no no . Grad F : Uh , those are over rated . Grad E : No , by all means , Professor C : And so I { disfmarker } what I 'd like to do is { disfmarker } is in the short run focus on getting it right . Grad E : right . Uh , sure . Professor C : And when we think we have it right then saying , `` aha ! , Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : can we make it more elegant ? `` Grad E : Yeah , that 's { disfmarker } Professor C : Can { disfmarker } can we , uh { disfmarker } What are the generalizations , and stuff ? Grad E : Yeah . Connect the dots . Yeah . Professor C : But rather than try to guess a inheritance structure and all that sort of stuff before we know what we 're doing . Grad E : Yep . Yeah . Professor C : So I would say in the short run we 're not gon na b Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : First of all , we 're not doing them yet at all . And { disfmarker } and it could be that half way through we say , `` aha ! , we { disfmarker } we now see how we want to clean it up . `` Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Uh , and inheritance is only one { disfmarker } I mean , that 's one way to organize it but there are others . And it may or may not be the best way . Grad E : Yeah . Grad A : Mmm . Professor C : I 'm sorry , you had news . Grad A : Oh , just small stuff . Um , thanks to Eva on our web site we can now , if you want to run JavaBayes , uh , you could see { disfmarker } get { disfmarker } download these classes . And then it will enable you { disfmarker } she modified the GUI so it has now a m a m a button menu item for saving it into the embedded JavaBayes format . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : Mmm . Grad A : So that 's wonderful . Professor C : Great . Grad A : And , um and she , a You tested it out . Do you want to say something about that , that it works , right ? With the { disfmarker } Grad D : I was just checking like , when we wan na , um , get the posterior probability of , like , variables . You know how you asked whether we can , like , just observe all the variables like in the same list ? You ca n't . Grad A : Uh - huh . Grad D : You have to make separate queries every time . Grad A : OK , that 's { disfmarker } that 's a bit unfortunate Grad D : So { disfmarker } Yeah . Grad A : but for the time being it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } it 's fine to do it { disfmarker } Grad D : You just have to have a long list of , you know , all the variables . Grad A : Yeah . But uh { disfmarker } Grad D : Basically . Grad F : Uh , all the things you want to query , you just have to like ask for separately . Grad D : Yeah , yeah . Grad A : Well that 's { disfmarker } probably maybe in the long term that 's good news because it forces us to think a little bit more carefully how { disfmarker } how we want to get an out output . Um , but that 's a different discussion for a different time . And , um , I do n't know . We 're really running late , so I had , uh , an idea yesterday but , uh , I do n't know whether we should even start discussing . Professor C : W what { disfmarker } Yeah , sure , tell us what it is . Grad A : Um , the construal bit that , um , has been pointed to but has n't been , um , made precise by any means , um , may w may work as follows . I thought that we would , uh { disfmarker } that the following thing would be in incredibly nice and I have no clue whether it will work at all or nothing . So that 's just a tangent , a couple of mental disclaimers here . Um , imagine you { disfmarker } you write a Bayes - net , um { disfmarker } Grad F : Bayes ? Grad A : Bayes - net , Grad F : OK . Grad A : um , completely from scratch every time you do construal . So you have nothing . Just a white piece of paper . Professor C : Mmm , right . Grad A : You consult { disfmarker } consult your ontology which will tell you a bunch of stuff , and parts , and properties , uh - uh - uh Grad F : Grout out the things that { disfmarker } that you need . Professor C : Right . Grad A : then y you 'd simply write , uh , these into { disfmarker } onto your { disfmarker } your white piece of paper . And you will get a lot of notes and stuff out of there . You wo n't get { disfmarker } you wo n't really get any C P T 's , therefore we need everything that { disfmarker } that configures to what the situation is , IE , the context dependent stuff . So you get whatever comes from discourse but also filtered . Uh , so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse plus the situation and the user model . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad A : And that fills in your CPT 's with which you can then query , um , the { disfmarker } the net that you just wrote and find out how thing X is construed as an utterance U . And the embedded JavaBayes works exactly like that , that once you { disfmarker } we have , you know , precise format in which to write it , so we write it down . You query it . You get the result , and you throw it away . And the { disfmarker } the nice thing about this idea is that you do n't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it . You may have some general rules as to how things can be { disfmarker } can be construed as what , so that will allow you to craft the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the initial notes . But it 's { disfmarker } in that respect it 's completely scalable . Because it does n't have any prior , um , configuration . It 's just you need an ontology of the domain and you need the context dependent modules . And if this can be made to work at all , { vocalsound } that 'd be kind of funky . Professor C : Um , it sounds to me like you want P R Grad A : P R Ms - uh , PRM I mean , since you can unfold a PRM into a straightforward Bayes - net { disfmarker } Professor C : Beca - because it { disfmarker } b because { disfmarker } No , no , you ca n't . See the { disfmarker } the critical thing about the PRM is it gives these relations in general form . So once you have instantiated the PRM with the instances and ther then you can { disfmarker } then you can unfold it . Grad A : Then you can . Mm - hmm , yeah . No , I was m using it generic . So , uh , probabilistic , whatever , relational models . Whatever you write it . In { disfmarker } Professor C : Well , no , but it matters a lot because you { disfmarker } what you want are these generalized rules about the way things relate , th that you then instantiate in each case . Grad A : And then { disfmarker } then instantiate them . That 's ma maybe the { disfmarker } the way { disfmarker } the only way it works . Professor C : Yeah , and that 's { disfmarker } Grad A :  Professor C : Yeah , that 's the only way it could work . I { disfmarker } we have a { disfmarker } our local expert on P R uh , but my guess is that they 're not currently good enough to do that . But we 'll { disfmarker } we 'll have to see . Grad A : But , uh , Professor C : Uh { disfmarker } Yes . This is { disfmarker } that 's { disfmarker } that would be a good thing to try . It 's related to the Hobbs abduction story in that you th you throw everything into a pot and you try to come up with the , uh { disfmarker } Grad A : Except there 's no { disfmarker } no theorem prover involved . Grad F : Best explanation . Professor C : No , there is n't a theorem prover but there { disfmarker } but { disfmarker } but the , um , The cove the { disfmarker } the P R Ms are like rules of inference and you 're { disfmarker } you 're coupling a bunch of them together . Grad A : Mm - hmm , yeah . Professor C : And then ins instead of proving you 're trying to , you know , compute the most likely . Uh { disfmarker } Tricky . But you { disfmarker } yeah , it 's a good { disfmarker } it 's a { disfmarker } it 's a good thing to put in your thesis proposal . Grad A : What 's it ? Professor C : So are you gon na write something for us before you go ? Grad A : Yes . Um . Professor C : Oh , you have something . Grad A : In the process thereof , or whatever . Professor C : OK . So , what 's { disfmarker } what { disfmarker } when are we gon na meet again ? Grad F : When are you leaving ? Grad A : Fri - uh , Grad F : Thursday , Friday ? Grad A : Thursday 's my last day here . Grad D : Fri Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : OK . Grad A : So { disfmarker } I would suggest as soon as possible . Do you mean by we , the whole ben gang ? Professor C : N no , I did n't mean y just the two of us . We { disfmarker } obviously we can { disfmarker } we can do this . But the question is do you want to , for example , send the little group , uh , a draft of your thesis proposal and get , uh , another session on feedback on that ? Or { disfmarker } Grad A : We can do it Th - Thursday again . Yeah . Grad E : Fine with me . Should we do the one PM time for Thursday since we were on that before or { disfmarker } ? Grad A : Sure . Grad E : OK . Professor C : Alright . Grad D : Hmm . Grad A : Thursday at one ? I can also maybe then sort of run through the , uh { disfmarker } the talk I have to give at EML which highlights all of our work . Professor C : OK . Grad A : And we can make some last minute changes on that . Professor C : OK . Grad B : You can just give him the abstract that we wrote for the paper . Professor C : That - that 'll tell him exactly what 's going on . Yeah , that { disfmarker } Alright . Grad F : Can we do { disfmarker } can we do one - thirty ? Grad A : No . Grad F : Oh , you already told me no . Grad A : But we can do four . Grad F : One , OK , it 's fine . I can do one . It 's fine . It 's fine . Grad A : One or four . I do n't care . Grad E : To me this is equal . I do n't care . Grad A : If it 's equal for all ? What should we do ? Grad F : Yeah , it 's fine . Grad A : Four ? Grad F : Fine . Yeah { disfmarker } no , no , no , uh , I do n't care . It 's fine . Grad A : It 's equal to all of us , so you can decide one or four . Grad B : The pressure 's on you Nancy . Grad A : Liz actually said she likes four because it forces the Meeting Recorder people to cut , you know { disfmarker } the discussions short . Grad F : OK . OK , four . Grad E : Well , if you insist , then . Grad F : OK ? OK . I am . 
Query : What was concluded on semantic specification ? Professor C : OK . Grad E : Extremely . Grad F : OK , um , so I think the middle block does n't really give you any more information , ex than the top block . And the bottom block similarly only just illus you know , all it does is illustrate that you can drop the subscripts and { disfmarker } and that you can drop the , um { disfmarker } uh , that you can give dual types . Oh , one thing I should mention is about `` designates `` . I think I 'm actually inconsistent across these as well . So , um , strike out the M subscript on the middle block . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad F : So basically now , um , this is actually { disfmarker } this little change actually goes along with a big linguistic change , which is that `` designates `` is n't only something for the semantics to worry about now . Professor C : Good . Grad F : So we want s `` designates `` to actually know one of the constituents which acts like a head in some respects but is sort of , um , really important for say composition later on . So for instance , if some other construction says , you know , `` are you of type { disfmarker } is this part of type whatever `` , um , the `` designates `` tells you which sort of part is the meaning part . OK , so if you have like `` the big red ball `` , you know , you wan na know if there 's an object or a noun . Well , ball is going to be the designated sort of element of that kind of phrase . Grad E : Mmm . Grad F : Um , there is a slight complication here which is that when we talk about form it 's useful sometimes to talk about , um { disfmarker } to talk about there also being a designated object and we think that that 'll be the same one , right ? So the ball is the head of the phrase , `` the r the { disfmarker } `` , um , `` big red ball `` , and the entity denoted by the word `` ball `` is sort of the semantic head in some ways of { disfmarker } of this sort of , um , in interesting larger element . Professor C : A a and the { disfmarker } Yeah . And there 's { disfmarker } uh there 's ca some cases where the grammar depends on some form property of the head . And { disfmarker } and this enables you to get that , if I understand you right . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Right , right . Grad E : That 's the idea . Professor C : Yeah yeah . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : And , uh , you might be able to say things like if the head has to go last in a head - final language , you can refer to the head as a p the , you know { disfmarker } the formal head as opposed to the rest of the form having to be at the end of that decision . Professor C : Right . Grad F : So that 's a useful thing so that you can get some internal structural constraints in . Professor C : OK , so that all looks good . Let me { disfmarker } Oh , w Oh . I do n't know . Were you finished ? Grad F : Um , there was a list of things that is n't included but you { disfmarker } you can { disfmarker } you can ask a question . That might @ @ it . Professor C : OK . So , i if I understand this the { disfmarker } aside from , uh , construed and all that sort of stuff , the { disfmarker } the differences are mainly that , { vocalsound } we 've gone to the possibility of having form - meaning pairs for a type Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : or actually gone back to , Grad F : Right . Professor C : if we go back far enough { disfmarker } Grad F : Well , except for their construction meaning , so it 's not clear that , uh { disfmarker } Well , right now it 's a c uh contr construction type and meaning type . So I do n't know what a form type is . Professor C : Oh , I see . Yeah , yeah , yeah . I 'm sorry , you 're right . Grad F : Yeah . Professor C : A construction type . Uh , that 's fine . But it , um { disfmarker } Grad F : Right . A well , and a previous , um , you know , version of the notation certainly allowed you to single out the meaning bit by it . So you could say `` construct of type whatever designates something `` . Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : But that was mostly for reference purposes , just to refer to the meaning pole . I do n't think that it was often used to give an extra meaning const type constraint on the meaning , which is really what we want most of the time I think . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Um , I { disfmarker } I do n't know if we 'll ever have a case where we actually h if there is a form category constraint , you could imagine having a triple there that says , you know { disfmarker } that 's kind of weird . Professor C : No , no , no , I do n't think so . I think that you 'll { disfmarker } you 'll do fine . Grad E : I { disfmarker } Professor C : In fact , these are , um , as long as { disfmarker } as Mark is n't around , these are form constraints . So a nominal expression is { disfmarker } uh , the fact that it 's animate , is semantic . The fact that it 's n uh , a nominal expression I would say on most people 's notion of { disfmarker } of f you know , higher form types , this i this is one . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Yeah . 
Query : Please describe the semantic specification Professor C : I 'll - I 'll wait . OK . Grad F : but I think that { disfmarker } something like that is probably gon na be , uh , more { disfmarker } more what we have to do . Grad A : Hmm . Professor C : OK . Grad F : But , um , Grad A : So Grad F : OK , that was one comment . And you had another one ? Grad A : Yeah , well the { disfmarker } once you know what the focus is the { disfmarker } everything else is background . How about `` topic - comment `` that 's the other side of information . Grad F : How about what ? Grad A : Topic - comment . Grad F : Yeah , so that was the other thing . And so I did n't realize it before . It 's like , `` oh ! `` It was an epiphany that it { disfmarker } you know , topic and focus are a contrast set . So topic is { disfmarker } Topic - focused seems to me like , um , background profile , OK , or a landmark trajector , or some something like that . There 's { disfmarker } there 's definitely , um , that kind of thing going on . Grad A : Mmm . Grad F : Now I do n't know whether { disfmarker } I n I do n't have as many great examples of like topic - indicating constructions on like focus , right ? Um , topic { disfmarker } it seems kind of { disfmarker } you know , I think that might be an ongoing kind of thing . Grad A : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Japanese has this though . You know . Grad F : Topic marker ? Grad A : Yeah . Grad E : Yeah , that 's what `` wa `` is , uh , just to mark which thing is the topic . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad E : It does n't always have to be the subject . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Right . So again , information structure has a topic slot . And , you know , I stuck it in thinking that we might use it . Grad A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Um , I think I stuck it in . Professor C : Yep , it 's there . Grad F : Um , and one thing that I did n't do consistently , um , is { disfmarker } when we get there , is like indicate what kind of thing fits into every role . I think I have an idea of what it should be but th you know , so far we 've been getting away with like either a type constraint or , um , you know , whatever . I forg it 'll be a frame . You know , it 'll be { disfmarker } it 'll be another predication or it 'll be , um , I do n't know , some value from { disfmarker } from some something , some variable and scope or something like that , or a slot chain based on a variable and scope . OK , so well that 's { disfmarker } should we flip over to the other side officially then ? Grad A : Mm - hmm , hmm . Grad E : OK , side one . Grad F : I keep , uh , like , pointing forward to it . Yeah . Now we 'll go back to s OK , so this does n't include something which mi mi may have some effect on { disfmarker } on it , which is , um , the discourse situation context record , right ? So I did n't { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I meant just like draw a line and like , you know , you also have , uh , some tracking of what was going on . Professor C : Right . Grad F : And sort of { disfmarker } this is a big scale comment before I , you know , look into the details of this . But for instance you could imagine instead of having { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I changed the name of { disfmarker } um it used to be `` entities `` . So you see it 's `` scenario `` , `` referent `` and `` discourse segment `` . And `` scenario `` is essentially what kind of { disfmarker } what 's the basic predication , what event happened . And actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw { disfmarker } draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ? Um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f Grad E : Mm - hmm . 
Query : How would the mental spaces operate ? Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : or this is something that 's like in my world knowledge but not active . Professor C : This { disfmarker } Uh { disfmarker } yeah , well there { disfmarker } there seems to be context properties . Grad F : So . Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : Yeah , they 're contex and for instance , I used to have a location thing there but actually that 's a property of the situation . And it 's again , time , you know { disfmarker } at cert certain points things are located , you know , near or far from you Professor C : Well , uh , uh , this is recursive Grad F : and { disfmarker } Professor C : cuz until we do the uh , mental space story , we 're not quite sure { disfmarker } { comment } Th - th Grad F : Yeah . Professor C : which is fine . We 'll just { disfmarker } we 'll j Grad F : Yeah , yeah . So some of these are , uh { disfmarker } Professor C : we just do n't know yet . Grad F : Right . So I { disfmarker } so for now I thought , well maybe I 'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance , right ? Everything else here is utterance - specific . Um , and I left the slot , `` predications `` , open because you can have , um , things like `` the guy I know from school `` . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Or , you know , like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know , predications that you might make . And it 's unclear whether { disfmarker } I mean , you could just have in your scenario , `` here are some extra few things that are true `` , right ? Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : And then you could just sort of not have this slot here . Right ? You 're { disfmarker } but { disfmarker } but it 's used for identification purposes . Professor C : Right . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : So it 's { disfmarker } it 's a little bit different from just saying `` all these things are true from my utterance `` . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Um . Grad E : Right , `` this guy I know from school came for dinner `` does not mean , um , `` there 's a guy , I know him from school , and he came over for dinner `` . That 's not the same effect . Grad F : Yeah , it 's a little bit { disfmarker } it 's a little bit different . Right ? So { disfmarker } Or maybe that 's like a restrictive , non - restrictive { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : you know , it 's like it gets into that kind of thing for { disfmarker } um , but maybe I 'm mixing , you know { disfmarker } this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : So you might imagine that the information you pass to , you know { disfmarker } in identifying a particular referent would be , `` oh , some { disfmarker } `` you know , `` it 's a guy and it 's someone I know from school `` . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : So maybe that would , you know , be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc to the , whatever , construal engine or whatever , discourse context , to find { disfmarker } you know , either create this reference , Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : in which case it 'd be created here , and { disfmarker } you know , so { disfmarker } so you could imagine that this might not { disfmarker } So , uh , I 'm uncommitted to a couple of these things . Grad A : But { disfmarker } to make it m precise at least in my mind , uh , it 's not precise . Grad F : Um . Grad A : So `` house `` is gender neuter ? In reality Grad F : Um , it could be in { disfmarker } Grad A : or in { disfmarker } Professor C : Semantically . Grad A : semantically . Grad F : semantically , yeah . Yeah . Grad A : So { disfmarker } Grad F : So it uh , uh , a table . You know , a thing that c does n't have a gender . So . Uh , it could be that { disfmarker } I mean , maybe you 'd { disfmarker } maybe not all these { disfmarker } I mean , I wou I would say that I tried to keep slots here that were potentially relevant to most { disfmarker } most things . Grad A : No , just to make sure that we { disfmarker } everybody that 's { disfmarker } completely agreed that it { disfmarker } it has nothing to do with , uh , form . Grad F : Yeah . OK , that is semantic as opposed to { disfmarker } Yeah . Yeah . That 's right . Um . Grad A : Then `` predications `` makes sense to { disfmarker } to have it open for something like , uh , accessibility or not . Grad F : S so again { disfmarker } Open to various things . Grad A : Yeah . Grad F : Right . OK , so . Let 's see . So maybe having made that big sca sort of like large scale comment , should I just go through each of these slots { disfmarker } uh , each of these blocks , um , a little bit ? Grad E : Sure . Grad F : Um , mostly the top one is sort of image schematic . And just a note , which was that , um { disfmarker } s so when we actually ha so for instance , um , some of them seem more inherently static , OK , like a container or sort of support - ish . And others are a little bit seemingly inherently dynamic like `` source , path , goal `` is often thought of that way or `` force `` , or something like that . But in actual fact , I think that they 're intended to be sort of neutral with respect to that . And different X - schemas use them in a way that 's either static or dynamic . So `` path `` , you could just be talking about the path between this and this . Grad E : Mmm . Grad F : And you know , `` container `` that you can go in and out . All of these things . And so , um , I think this came up when , uh , Ben and I were working with the Spaniards , um , the other day { disfmarker } the `` Spaniettes `` , as we { vocalsound } called them { disfmarker } um , to decide like how you want to split up , like , s image schematic contributions versus , like , X - schematic contributions . How do you link them up . And I think again , um , it 's gon na be something in the X - schema that tells you `` is this static or is this dynamic `` . So we definitely need { disfmarker } that sort of aspectual type gives you some of that . Um , that , you know , is it , uh , a state or is it a change of state , or is it a , um , action of some kind ? Grad A : Uh , i i i is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you do n't ? Grad F : Uh . Yeah . Grad A : Just means { disfmarker } Grad F : Oh , oh ! You mean , in the slot ? 
Query : What is the description of the domains in the mental spaces ? Grad A : Mm - hmm , hmm . Grad E : OK , side one . Grad F : I keep , uh , like , pointing forward to it . Yeah . Now we 'll go back to s OK , so this does n't include something which mi mi may have some effect on { disfmarker } on it , which is , um , the discourse situation context record , right ? So I did n't { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I meant just like draw a line and like , you know , you also have , uh , some tracking of what was going on . Professor C : Right . Grad F : And sort of { disfmarker } this is a big scale comment before I , you know , look into the details of this . But for instance you could imagine instead of having { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I changed the name of { disfmarker } um it used to be `` entities `` . So you see it 's `` scenario `` , `` referent `` and `` discourse segment `` . And `` scenario `` is essentially what kind of { disfmarker } what 's the basic predication , what event happened . And actually it 's just a list of various slots from which you would draw { disfmarker } draw in order to paint your picture , a bunch of frames , bi and bindings , right ? Um , and obviously there are other ones that are not included here , general cultural frames and general like , uh , other action f Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : you know , specific X - schema frames . OK , whatever . The middle thing used to be `` entities `` because you could imagine it should be like really a list where here was various information . And this is intended to be grammatically specifiable information about a referent { disfmarker } uh , you know , about some entity that you were going to talk about . So `` Harry walked into the room `` , `` Harry `` and `` room `` , you know , the room { disfmarker } th but they would be represented in this list somehow . And it could also have for instance , it has this category slot . Um , it should be either category or in or instance . Basically , it could be a pointer to ontology . So that everything you know about this could be { disfmarker } could be drawn in . But the important things for grammatical purposes are for { disfmarker } things like number , gender , um { disfmarker } ki the ones I included here are slightly arbitrary but you could imagine that , um , you need to figure out wheth if it 's a group whether , um , some event is happening , linear time , linear spaces , like , you know , are { disfmarker } are they doing something serially or is it like , um , uh I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm not sure . Because this partly came from , uh , Talmy 's schema and I 'm not sure we 'll need all of these actually . But { disfmarker } Um , and then the `` status `` I used was like , again , in some languages , you know , like for instance in child language you might distinguish between different status . So , th the { disfmarker } the big com and { disfmarker } and finally `` discourse segment `` is about { vocalsound } sort of speech - act - y information structure - y , like utterance - specific kinds of things . So the comment I was going to make about , um , changing entity { disfmarker } the entity 's block to reference is that { vocalsound } you can imagine your discourse like situation context , you have a set of entities that you 're sort of referring to . And you might { disfmarker } that might be sort of a general , I do n't know , database of all the things in this discourse that you could refer to . And I changed to `` reference `` cuz I would say , for a particular utterance you have particular referring expressions in it . And those are the ones that you get information about that you stick in here . For instance , I know it 's going to be plural . I know it 's gon na be feminine or something like that . And { disfmarker } and these could actually just point to , you know , the { disfmarker } the ID in my other list of enti active entities , right ? So , um , uh , th there 's { disfmarker } there 's all this stuff about discourse status . We 've talked about . I almost listed `` discourse status `` as a slot where you could say it 's active . You know , there 's this , um , hierarchy { disfmarker } uh there 's a schematization of , you know , things can be active or they can be , um , accessible , inaccessible . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : It was the one that , you know , Keith , um , emailed to us once , to some of us , not all of us . And the thing is that that { disfmarker } I noticed that that , um , list was sort of discourse dependent . It was like in this particular set , s you know , instance , it has been referred to recently or it has n't been , Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : or this is something that 's like in my world knowledge but not active . Professor C : This { disfmarker } Uh { disfmarker } yeah , well there { disfmarker } there seems to be context properties . Grad F : So . Professor C : Yeah . Grad F : Yeah , they 're contex and for instance , I used to have a location thing there but actually that 's a property of the situation . And it 's again , time , you know { disfmarker } at cert certain points things are located , you know , near or far from you Professor C : Well , uh , uh , this is recursive Grad F : and { disfmarker } Professor C : cuz until we do the uh , mental space story , we 're not quite sure { disfmarker } { comment } Th - th Grad F : Yeah . Professor C : which is fine . We 'll just { disfmarker } we 'll j Grad F : Yeah , yeah . So some of these are , uh { disfmarker } Professor C : we just do n't know yet . Grad F : Right . So I { disfmarker } so for now I thought , well maybe I 'll just have in this list the things that are relevant to this particular utterance , right ? Everything else here is utterance - specific . Um , and I left the slot , `` predications `` , open because you can have , um , things like `` the guy I know from school `` . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Or , you know , like your referring expression might be constrained by certain like unbounded na amounts of prep you know , predications that you might make . And it 's unclear whether { disfmarker } I mean , you could just have in your scenario , `` here are some extra few things that are true `` , right ? Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : And then you could just sort of not have this slot here . Right ? You 're { disfmarker } but { disfmarker } but it 's used for identification purposes . Professor C : Right . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : So it 's { disfmarker } it 's a little bit different from just saying `` all these things are true from my utterance `` . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : Um . Grad E : Right , `` this guy I know from school came for dinner `` does not mean , um , `` there 's a guy , I know him from school , and he came over for dinner `` . That 's not the same effect . Grad F : Yeah , it 's a little bit { disfmarker } it 's a little bit different . Right ? So { disfmarker } Or maybe that 's like a restrictive , non - restrictive { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : you know , it 's like it gets into that kind of thing for { disfmarker } um , but maybe I 'm mixing , you know { disfmarker } this is kind of like the final result after parsing the sentence . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : So you might imagine that the information you pass to , you know { disfmarker } in identifying a particular referent would be , `` oh , some { disfmarker } `` you know , `` it 's a guy and it 's someone I know from school `` . Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : So maybe that would , you know , be some intermediate structure that you would pass into the disc to the , whatever , construal engine or whatever , discourse context , to find { disfmarker } you know , either create this reference , Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : in which case it 'd be created here , and { disfmarker } you know , so { disfmarker } so you could imagine that this might not { disfmarker } So , uh , I 'm uncommitted to a couple of these things . Grad A : But { disfmarker } to make it m precise at least in my mind , uh , it 's not precise . Grad F : Um . Grad A : So `` house `` is gender neuter ? In reality Grad F : Um , it could be in { disfmarker } 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . User Interface : .. . Project Manager : Okay . So , this is uh first meeting of this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I do n't know if it was sent round to all of you . User Interface : Mm , yeah . Project Manager : Maybe not . Anyway , User Interface : I did n't receive it yet { vocalsound } . Project Manager : this is the the plan for today 's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I 'm sure you 've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to { disfmarker } so that we get to know each other a little bit more . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we 'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss { disfmarker } come up with some preliminary ideas about it . And then that 's it . So we 've got twenty five minutes to do that , that 's until eleven twenty five . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { gap } so sh Project Manager : S so any any questions ? Industrial Designer : { gap } { vocalsound } { gap } . Project Manager : Is i { gap } not at this point . User Interface : Not at this point . Project Manager : So this is our project . What we 're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . The method that we 're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There 's the functional design of the the remote control . We 're going { disfmarker } the way we 'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that . Um similarly with the conceptual design , we 'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we 'll bring what we 've done together . Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We 'll pull it all together . Industrial Designer : I 'm a bit confused about uh what 's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ? Project Manager : I think it { disfmarker } th w we 're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you 'll be { disfmarker } we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : and what what specific things it it has to do Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the { disfmarker } how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . Industrial Designer : How how it will be done . So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it 's it 's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the { disfmarker } it 's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? Project Manager : Um I think we 'll we 'll start that initially with the functional design already but then Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : { disfmarker } yeah . Okay , so that 's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I 'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we 're using for { vocalsound } for the project , specifically the whiteboard . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Project Manager : So each person in turn , I 'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen 's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you 're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you 're taking in this project . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Why are you looking at me ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Would you like to go first ? { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Do I have a choice ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay .

Marketing : So , my name 's Cat and I 'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : so um { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : It 's got no eyes . Marketing : Oh , good point . Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do { gap } it 's eyes like ? Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } I thought it might be a cat . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , I do n't think it 's furry enough , so we 'll make it a fluffy rabbit . User Interface : Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah I can see by the ears . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Okay , right , it 's a fluffy rabbit , blue . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Rabbits do n't come in blue but you know .

User Interface : Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . Mm , well that 's compared to some other animals like cats . Um they 're really much more fun because they are not so independent . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Um yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Uh I hope to be loyal to the project Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , { vocalsound } yeah .

User Interface : um so um in the different um { vocalsound } stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for { vocalsound } yeah , designing the technical functions of the um { vocalsound } um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . Industrial Designer : { gap } . User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay , that 's it . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Thank you . Okay { vocalsound } um { vocalsound } I 'll do some { disfmarker } I 'll rub the features Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : and let the drawing stay . { vocalsound } 'Kay um my name is Gaurav . Um { vocalsound } my favourite animal { disfmarker } one of my favourite animals is a cow . I 've got no idea how to draw a cow . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Good luck . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Uh this is going to be { disfmarker } Marketing : They 're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs Industrial Designer : Yeah , that 'll do . Marketing : and then just some horns . Industrial Designer : Okay , so let let me draw the body first . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm .

Project Manager : I 'm from Melbourne and I 'm your Project Manager for today Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . User Interface : Wonderful . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . Industrial Designer : Thank you . Project Manager : { vocalsound } So , let 's see what 's next in the PowerPoint presentation . So , I 've just thought { disfmarker } Marketing : If you right click on it you can { disfmarker } Project Manager : yeah I 've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally { vocalsound } as { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : there we go . Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . We 've got { disfmarker } um we 're planning to sell these remote controls for { disfmarker } let 's make that go away , that means we 've got five minutes . Um we 're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . Um and with that we 're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . And that 's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ . Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . So that 's something to keep in mind while you 're designing . Okay . Hmm . This is { disfmarker } let me just skip ahead to see { disfmarker } that 's the last thing , okay . We 've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we 're thinking of this remote control ? User Interface : Yep . I 'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have { disfmarker } w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . I think that 's probably something that w it 's best if we take away with us , Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that { vocalsound } are out of the ordinary . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was { disfmarker } that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . Project Manager : Something something new . Marketing : Yeah , I was looking at the website , Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : and the other things that they 've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : and um so it 's something that is sleek and stylish but it 's still functional , you know ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So I 'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they do n't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . Industrial Designer : Alright . Project Manager : Uh-huh . Marketing : You know , so something heading towards that , so it 's not overly { disfmarker } I mean I do n't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Something that 's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : But what do most people do ? Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , Marketing : Sometimes they play a movie . Industrial Designer : but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah . Marketing : Yeah , so Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : there 's no need to have buttons on it to do that , Project Manager : So , no . Marketing : maybe to do { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yep . Project Manager : It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : And then use the { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So , if you 're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that 's fine Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : Excellent . Marketing : 'Cause like if you look at the train , it 's just very like , there 's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing Project Manager : Oh I have n't had a look yet , yep . Marketing : um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ? Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } Uh we can aim for { disfmarker } I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I do n't think that um it 's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Hmm . User Interface : Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we should n't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems Industrial Designer : Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah . User Interface : with l { vocalsound } learning , yeah , yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a { disfmarker } Project Manager : It 's like those fancy websites that you ca n't access Industrial Designer : yeah . User Interface : Hm-hmm . Project Manager : because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um { vocalsound } we 've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so you 're { disfmarker } you 'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you 're looking at the working design , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Alright . Project Manager : you 're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it 's the user requirements specification , Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : like you said at the start . Okay ? Thanks for that . User Interface : Okay . { vocalsound } Thank you . Project Manager : Uh I 'll see you in half an hour . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } . User Interface : { vocalsound } See you . Project Manager : Carry the laptops back again . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Project Manager : Do we need to unplug things ? Probably . 
Query : What did the group discuss about the design goal of the remote control ? User Interface : Not at this point . Project Manager : there we go . Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . We 've got { disfmarker } um we 're planning to sell these remote controls for { disfmarker } let 's make that go away , that means we 've got five minutes .

Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Something that 's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : But what do most people do ? Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , Marketing : Sometimes they play a movie . Industrial Designer : but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah . Marketing : Yeah , so Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : there 's no need to have buttons on it to do that , Project Manager : So , no . Marketing : maybe to do { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yep . Project Manager : It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . Marketing : So , if you 're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that 's fine Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : Excellent . Marketing : 'Cause like if you look at the train , it 's just very like , there 's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing Project Manager : Oh I have n't had a look yet , yep . Marketing : um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ? Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } Uh we can aim for { disfmarker } I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I do n't think that um it 's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Hmm . User Interface : Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we should n't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems Industrial Designer : Yeah . A big learning curve , yeah . User Interface : with l { vocalsound } learning , yeah , yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a { disfmarker } Project Manager : It 's like those fancy websites that you ca n't access

Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Lynne Neagle AM : Good morning , everyone . Welcome to the Children , Young People and Education Committee . We 've received apologies for absence from Julie Morgan , and I 'm very pleased to welcome David Rees , who is substituting for her today . Can I ask Members whether there are any declarations of interest , please ? No . Okay . Thank you very much . Item 2 this morning , then , is a session with the Minister for Children and Social Care on the Welsh Government 's childcare offer . So , I 'm very pleased to welcome Huw Irranca-Davies , Minister for Children and Social Care , also Jo-Anne Daniels , director for communities and tackling poverty , and Owain Lloyd , deputy director for childcare , play and early years . So , thank you , all , for your attendance . If you 're happy , we 'll go straight into questions from Members , and the first questions come from Hefin David . Hefin David AM : Good morning , Minister . How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas , and is it something of a mixed bag ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : It 's gone well , but I 'm glad we 've done it through this process of early implementer , actually piloting it , because we 're learning lessons as we go along . It has gone well . It 's been encouraging , to the extent that we 're at the point where we 're expanding—we 've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons . But , in terms of what we 're learning , one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we 're taking , because it 's being done on the seven early implementers . So , we 're asking parents to come in , provide their wage slips , provide the birth certificates , and so on . You 're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds , so it 's difficult . And the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area . In one case , it 's a whole authority , but it 's only one—that 's in Blaenau Gwent . In others , it 's smaller areas . So , we 're also hitting those— . The other big challenge we 're hitting is communication . So , we 're having parents , generally , who are outside the areas entirely saying , 'Why have n't we got this yet ? Can we please get into it ? ' , which is encouraging . But the other thing we 're having is people who are within pilot authorities , where it does n't extend to the whole authority , saying , 'Well , hold on now , we think we qualify for something under universal care , we think we qualify for something on tax credits . Why do n't we qualify for this ? ' 'Well , you 're not in the pilot area . ' So , we 're learning about these things , but the biggest one , I have to say , is the administrative burden , and I think that 's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out . Hefin David AM : What is the administrative burden ? What specifically is that ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : It is that sheer burden on each local authority , and each pilot area , to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility , to bring in documents to prove their eligibility , to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are , what their salary slips say . It 's incredibly bureaucratic . So , yesterday , when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding ( Wales ) Bill , we made clear that our preferred option , as put within that framework Bill , is actually to build on , and to learn from the lessons as well , the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model , where you actually have—and this , by the way , is supported by local authority providers out there—one system that is a centralised system , where there is clarity , that is handled , that has elements of information sharing between Government departments , such as the Department for Work and Pensions , and so on , so that the work is done for the parents , and the work is done for the local authorities ; much cleaner , much simpler . Hefin David AM : How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020 ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We are very confident . But , as I say , I 'm more confident in the fact that we 're actually piloting it , and phasing this in , because I think we 've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere , including just over the border in England , where they have a different version of a childcare offer , but they 've gone for it in a big-bang approach . And it has led to technical issues , it 's led to volume issues , where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it , and the complexity , I have to say , of individual family situations , whereas what we are doing , Hefin , is taking this forward very , very carefully . Each roll-out , each expansion that we 're doing of the pilot is not—and I know this has caused some people to come back and say , 'Why ca n't we all have it now ? ' It 's because we 're only rolling out to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it 's rurality or , as it will be within densely urban areas , where the cost might be slightly higher , and that 's allowing us to have the confidence that we 'll have it . We 've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd—the whole of Gwynedd , Anglesey and Caerphilly . Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer . Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September . Swansea is planning to do it , they tell us , in due course—in short order—as well . So , we have the confidence now that , with that learning going on from different pilot areas , we 'll have the full roll-out by 2020 . Hefin David AM : Is it true to say that , in the early adopter areas , the intensity of demand for the services is not spread evenly across ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Absolutely . Hefin David AM : And why is that ? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : No , it wo n't cause a problem . If we were doing this tomorrow , it would cause a problem , but what we 're learning is that there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues . So , there are issues to do with— . It 's not capacity , by the way . We 're not finding a problem here with capacity , whether it 's in English language provision or whether it 's in Welsh language provision , whether it 's in children with complex needs , we 're not finding that as an issue . But what we are finding is , for example , one of the well-known ones—and I 've spoken about this before—is that , in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies , there is a family tradition of doing childcare within the families . I 've done it myself . Grandparents , aunts , uncles and so on provide free , unregistered , unlicensed childcare of a sort . Now that is n't what the scheme is about , by the way , I have to say . So , some of the aspects are cultural , but what we 're also doing alongside this , whilst looking at the capacity and looking at how we learnt from the pilot roll-out , is that communication with parents and providers and local authorities as well . So , we have a whole programme running alongside it . It 's about communicating what the offer is , how simple it is to get invovled in this and where they go to , and , critically , I think , how we do that national roll-out would be important as well . Hefin David AM : So , given the point you 've made about grandparents and family , would n't it be sensible , then , to offer a subsidy to grandparents to provide this kind of care ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Unregistered grandparents ? Hefin David AM : Well , through some kind of analysis of that . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Well , we do n't think so and there are good reasons behind this . Hefin David AM : Is it because you say that they would n't be registered as carers for their own family member ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , but there 's a deeper reason behind that registration as well . The childcare offer is n't only to just provide childcare ; it 's the wider aspects that come with this . This childcare offer ties into the foundation years offer . There 's an element of education linked to the childcare offer—there 's that 10 hours of the early education foundation years as well . The two tie together . So , there 's an issue here with quality , about socialisation and how children learn in an environment , as opposed to purely—as great as all our grandparents and aunts and uncles are—simply child-minding . That 's one important distinction . So , the focus of this scheme is very much on registered licensed providers , which could be , by the way—because we do have them , and we 're discussing this at the moment internally and with the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years and others—grandparents who are actually registered and inspected by the care inspectorate ? We 're having those discussions . Hefin David AM : How many of them are there ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We do n't think there is a huge number , but we 're trying to bottom this out at the moment . We have n't got the exact number , but we do n't think they are huge numbers , but there are , in our constituencies , registered , licensed , inspected grandparents who look after other people 's children in a little group of four or five or six or seven , but also their own grandchildren . Hefin David AM : So , they 're a kind of grandparents club . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes . Now that , I would say to you—and I know that Darren raised this on the floor yesterday as well—is markedly different in the nature of it , because it's registered and licensed , than simply informal grandparents or aunts or uncles . I say that as well because we also get people who will say to us , ' I don't want to be paid for looking after my grandchildren ; I look after my grandchildren because I look after them ' . Hefin David AM : And what about the view , given that you said that capacity was n't an issue , of the National Day Nurseries Association , which says that Wales has the most fragile childcare sector in Great Britain ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : I do n't agree we have the most fragile , but the childcare offer gives us an opportunity to make it more resilient and more robust . We know from the early piloting , and as we roll it out , that there is the immense diversity within the childcare sector , and we 're talking about everything from those very small terraced homes that have been licensed and registered to take six or seven children , to large , complex environments that perhaps are on maintained premises within school premises , provided by a voluntary or third sector organisation . So , there 's immense complexity and we know that that differs across Wales , and we also know there 's immense regional variation in the scale and the type of childcare offer . What the roll-out allows us to do , backed by £60 million of capital money behind it , in terms of capital development of childcare facilities , backed by a 10-year workforce development plan for childcare—and bear in mind this is bolted in as part of our foundational economy approach as well—that means , by 2020 , we get to the point where we 're putting the money into the capital development but also to the workforce development , because in some areas we 're finding it 's not to do with lack of provision and facilities , it 's to do with lack of staff . In other areas , we 're finding there are plenty of staff but not the adequate facilities . We 've got to get it right . Hefin David AM : That 's fair enough , but is it realistic to think that there 's going to be capacity growth in the next two to three years to deliver the product ? Is that realistic to think that that foundational sector can provide that level of staffing ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , I think it is , absolutely , because , again , what we 're finding is we 've got several things going on at once in terms of how we monitor and assess the development of this roll-out . One is the work that we 're doing on the ground with the phased roll-out , so we 're literally learning live time , and I have pretty much weekly or fortnightly updates on how things are going , but also there is a termly update as well . We 've also commissioned additional work from Arad to look at this first phase of the roll-out that we 've done to see what that tells us as well . But the feedback that we 're getting from the childcare providers themselves , on the basis that we 're now identifying where either the gaps in the workforce or the physical facilities are , is that , 'Yes , we can do this ' , because we 're putting the money in , we have the strategy for the workforce development , and it 's not going to be the same in all parts of Wales . It 's not as if what we 're saying is , 'Here 's what we 're going to do all of a sudden—flick a switch and we have a universality of the same type of provision everywhere . ' So , let me give you one key example . Alongside this , alongside the £60 million capital fund , alongside the workforce development , we 've also identified a separate strain of money into cylch meithrin . We know that there is a shortage in parts of Wales for Welsh language childcare development . We 're specifically putting money into developing that , and , in fact , the first one of those will be , from that new tranche of money , opening up , I think , in September . They anticipate , as part of our big strategy with Welsh language development , we 'll have an additional 40 of those by— Jo-Anne Daniels : Thirty . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : It 's an additional 30 by 2020 , and an additional doubling of that in the 10 years after that . We ca n't take this for granted , Hefin . This is difficult . This is hard work , but we have everything in place to make it happen . Hefin David AM : The last thing from me : the £4.50 single national rate—is there a danger that we might be creating a kind of EasyJet-style nursery provision where you get the basics but the wealthier parents are going to be able to pay for better care within those settings because of the add-ons ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We really mulled over this a lot and discussed it , I have to say , not only internally but with childcare providers out there and with parents as well and with local authorities . The first thing to say is the £4.50 rate that we 've set has been welcomed , and it 's been welcomed because it 's unlike the much more complex offer that 's in England , where there 's a variable rate and there are lots of determining factors on it and it 's added complexity and confusion . Hefin David AM : Can I just ask there , it 's been welcomed perhaps in Blaenau Gwent , but has it been equally welcomed in Cardiff ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : No , because we have n't rolled it out in Cardiff yet , and that is a salient point . Hefin David AM : Okay , fair enough . But will it be , then ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , it will be . Some of the more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport are knocking on our door saying , 'Please can we have this offer ? ' , and we are keen to give it to them . But , as I say— Hefin David AM : But do you anticipate a capacity problem with the £4.50 in those areas , compared to , say , the Cynon valley ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We ca n't anticipate it yet , Hefin , but that 's exactly the reason for going into that area and then assessing how it works . We 're reasonably confident that the £4.50— . We 're reasonably assured by the feedback that we 're having that the £4.50 might work as a universal amount . But if we learn , when we roll it out in Cardiff and Newport , that there needs to be some variation , we can look at that , because we 're not doing a big-bang approach . So , that is part of why we will move to roll it out within Cardiff and Newport and other more expensive areas and learn from it , but at the moment , I have to say , the £4.50 amount has been welcomed—it 's appropriate . You touched on the other aspect , though , of the wider aspects of beyond the £4.50 , because the £4.50 does n't cover everything . The £4.50 is a contribution towards the wraparound childcare element but it does n't cover—and we agonised over this—the issues of things like transport out on trips or food or snacks and things like this . Now , we did agonise a number of things that brought us to the conclusion where we are . I have to say , this has n't been ivory-tower stuff ; it 's been in discussion with the providers but also parents . One : parents are quite used to—with childcare settings and play care settings and so on—the idea that providers are quite different . Some providers charge a fee that does everything in one ; others provide simply the childcare element but they tell the parents—and I 'm used to this as a parent myself , although mine are older now—'Mr Irranca-Davies , when you sign on , just to be aware , if we do take your kids down to St Fagans , there 's going to be a little bit of a charge for that ' and so on . Hefin David AM : That 's fair enough , but it would be the lowest-income working families who would be most unduly affected by that , because the higher income families would be able to afford those add-ons , the lower income ones wo n't . Is n't that a concern ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : If money was absolutely no object , then I think you 'd be looking at quite a different offer , but it has to be affordable within what we 've got as well . The fact that parents , including those who are on lower incomes , are used to currently discriminating between providers , not only with childcare settings but also within school settings as well , where very often schools now will say , 'We 're doing something extra'— Hefin David AM : That may be the case , but it 's not fair , is it ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : In a pure argument about equity , and if funding was no object and if the burdens of austerity were released and we were told we had money—'You can do what you want'—I think you 'd be looking at a very different approach . But within what we have , I think this works very , very well indeed , because it 's very transparent for parents who are used to making these decisions . It says , 'Here you have 10 hours of the foundation education offer . You have the additional hours here provided with the childcare offer . But within those additional hours , you may be with a local provider in the middle of Powys that actually says , `` Within that we provide everything '' ; you may be with a provider that says , `` Well , actually , we do a whistles and bells thing and we take them out on trips , but it 's up to you if you want to come , and here 's the additional cost— '' . ' Parents are used to making that decision and realistically , in terms of what we can do with this offer , this is actually—the arguments around this have been well rehearsed both with providers and with parents and we 're not getting any concerns that this is going to unnecessarily disadvantage . In a total fairness argument , would you make it universal and with no additional charges ? Well , possibly you would . But we work within the realistic— Hefin David AM : Or have a lower top-end income limit . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Depending on how the Bill progresses in the main Chamber and when it goes through committee , there 's that flexibility built into the Bill that those things can be looked at over time and adjusted . For the moment , I think there is an attraction , in terms of the upper limit , of saying : one—'Let 's try not to add additional complexity , let 's go with a scheme that 's already working its way through the system , which is , if you like , what they 're doing in England , and not add additional complexity . But , secondly , there is an appeal to universality , curiously , in saying to all parents—and I say this regardless of political hues across the committee here—there 's an attraction when you say , 'Let 's make an offer focused on working parents as it is ' , as universal to those working parents as possible , and avoid the administrative costs of saying , 'Well , let 's take the upper limit down to £80 or £60 or £55 . ' There 's always the question of how much additional cost is incurred in actually doing that tweak of complexity . We have looked at it . Lynne Neagle AM : Darren on this . Darren Millar AM : Just to ask , I mean , the labour market costs are changing , are n't they ? You 've got the national living wage increasing— [ Inaudible . ] —that 's going to have a bearing , is n't it , on the affordability of this project in terms of the childcare offer and the suitability of the £4.50 per hour regime ? By the time it 's fully rolled out , of course , that £4.50 rate is going to be a number of years old , for example . Do you have plans to review that ? Where is it headed ? Because it 's certainly not going to be enough in the future . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : It depends how far in the future you 're looking . I have to say , the feedback that we 're having at the moment from organisations like the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years and from the National Day Nurseries Association Wales and others is that this is the right rate and it 's suitable not only today but for the foreseeable future of rolling this out . Darren Millar AM : But they 've raised concerns about the national living wage implications , have n't they , as well ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Of course , and I think it 's incumbent on us as well to not— Darren Millar AM : So , it 's not fair to say that they have n't raised concerns about the rate . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , but what they 're not arguing for at the moment is for this rate to be raised . Darren Millar AM : But they have suggested that in meetings— Huw Irranca-Davies AM : That in future— Darren Millar AM : Absolutely . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Well , of course , in future , any Minister , any committee , will want to come back and look at—is the hourly rate , as one element of the scheme , appropriate to the current financial challenges for the sector , and not least , by the way , as we try not only to develop the workforce , but to develop the career pathways through this as well ? And I think that 's the right discussion to be had , live time , as this is taken forward . But at this moment in time , we 're not getting people saying within this part of the roll-out that we need to adjust this amount . Darren Millar AM : So , have you forecasted for any adjustment in the rate going forward in terms of affordability of the project ? Because you 've still got this £100 million price tag on it , have n't you ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Similar to the point that was raised with Hefin about Cardiff and Newport , if we identify that the rate is not appropriate , if it's— . I do n't think anybody 's going to come back to us and say that it 's too little . But do bear in mind that it 's above where the average England rate is , even though there 's this complex variability within the English rate that has caused some confusion there , which is why the universal rate with us has been welcomed . If we find , as we pilot it , or if we find because there are more expensive areas for it to be delivered in , there needs to be adjustment , then we 'll be back in front of the committee arguing why that needs to be the case . Darren Millar AM : But that wo n't put the project at risk in terms of its finances ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : No , no . We are still very confident , looking forward , on the best projections we have , fed by the live input that 's coming in from the pilot , which will be fed again in the autumn—the Arad report coming forward—that we have not only the capacity to actually deliver this—challenging as this is , we have the capacity to deliver it—but also that the funding that 's available , on our best estimate—the estimate we 've stood by , that broad ball park of that £100 million figure—it 's deliverable within that . But if it changes , we will come back . And if it changes , I 'll have to be sitting down with my boss , Vaughan Gething , and with Mark Drakeford , to argue the case on it . But at this moment , we have confidence and we 've run the rule across this repeatedly . But that rate , combined with the other elements of this childcare offer—there is sufficient there allocated to actually deliver the whole roll-out . Lynne Neagle AM : Mark on this . Mark Reckless AM : Minister , as a parent who 's been researching childcare options , it 's obvious to me that in Cardiff , and to a degree in Newport and Monmouthshire , costs are substantially higher than this , and I haven't been able to find anywhere that has a six-hour day for £27 , which is implied by your rate . Is n't it the case that rents and wages are higher and therefore you 're going to need a higher rate to make it work ? Is n't that already obvious ? Why are you postponing coming back and looking at this until some point in the future ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Chair , my biggest fear is a parent who 's actually involved in this area already , but , having been one myself— . Mark , you may be right , that 's exactly why we 're piloting it and that 's why when we pilot in Cardiff and Newport , we know we have lessons to learn over the affordability and the £4.50 per hour rate . Mark Reckless AM : But you 're not piloting it in any of the high-cost areas that I 've referred to . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : No . We will be . We are going to be . Mark Reckless AM : When are you starting ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Cardiff and Newport—September . Owain Lloyd : This September . Mark Reckless AM : This September ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes . So , we 're not missing any of these learning experiences and we know that— . The reason we 've gone for the other areas first , by the way—please take this back to any authorities affected—is simply because we 've done deep dives into areas that vary from very rural areas in mid Wales , areas in north Wales , areas around Welsh language provision , areas in deep valleys , understanding the cultural and the economic impacts . So , we 've held back a little bit from going into what we know is an obvious challenge within the more expensive areas of provision . But it 's coming , it 's imminent , and we 'll learn the lessons from it . And do you know , you may be right ? And if you are right , that it 's more expensive , and we need a higher rate within those areas , then we 're going to have to come back and discuss it with the committee . But let 's go in and learn it first of all , rather than assume it necessarily . Lynne Neagle AM : Just before I bring David in on the issue that Hefin raised about the chargeable items , your paper says that providers can charge up to £7.50 a day for food , snacks , transport and consumables such as nappies . Now , that 's £37.50 a week , which is a lot of money for parents , and I just wondered if you wanted to comment on that figure ? But also , do you think there 's a risk that providers who maybe are n't charging at the moment may start charging because of any new pressures that arise because of this scheme ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : I think they 're the right areas to flag up , and if I thought that was going to happen I 'd be concerned as we take this forward and design this scheme . I think part of the evaluation from Arad will also show us that—whether or not , within the pilot areas that we are already in , which are quite diverse , that is happening . We 're only one term into learning the lessons , by the way , but I would want to make sure that we design a scheme where we are not heaping on disadvantage or where there was exploitation of disadvantaged families . So , the early evaluation , I think , will give us good feedback on that . I think also , by the way , that providers know that this is a collaborative effort to do this here . It 's not in their interests , I have to say , as the umbrella bodies or individual providers , to see this as some way that they can unduly rake in additional income from this on the backs of poorer families . This is about providing opportunities for all working families . But especially , I have to say , the early evaluation that we 've seen already suggests that the greatest proportion of those who are taking advantage of this scheme in the early parts—in the early evaluation—are those who are below the average working wage within in Wales . That 's by far the greatest number of people who are doing it , and we do n't want them then being priced out because of add-ons . So , there has to be some pragmatism , I have to say , and some open partnership working here with the sector , and we do have that . Lynne Neagle AM : John on this . John Griffiths AM : I want to come back to the £4.50 rate , but in terms of working with the sector , briefly , if I might , Chair , I just wonder , Huw , in terms of that £4.50 figure and understanding the sector in Wales , to what extent are we talking about a market rate and to what extent are we talking about the increase in demand that will come from the scheme and how that relates to economies of scale and capacity ? Is it purely a market rate or is there a conversation with the sector in terms of the benefits that will come from this scheme and how they should be recognised in terms of setting the rate ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : This has been a very open dialogue with the sector around affordability , around the hourly rate and around what might happen in future as well . This is not a pure hard data-driven analysis that says , 'Here we 've calculated everything and this is the rate that will satisfy it ' , because we recognise that there 's great diversity in provision out there , and we also recognise that things will change over time . It 's not only the geographical diversity—it 's the diversity of the sector itself . I think we need to , as we take this scheme forward and look at the full roll-out , continue in that very open dialogue with the sector not about what is purely a market-driven amount but actually what is also affordable for the Welsh Government within the constraints that we have . Just to flag up one issue , it 's right that we 're focusing on those elements that are n't included within it , to some extent as well , and the effect of that on more disadvantaged families , but that has to be balanced with the pocket of affordability for this scheme as well . Let me give you a clear illustration : some of our calculations have suggested that if we included free food within this offer as well , it would add something like in the region of 50p to that £4.50 rate . That would have , at this moment , impacts on the affordability of this and the roll-out of it . I would need to be going back to my seniors and arguing the case now , okay ? But , it 's that open dialogue with the sector that says , 'There 's one thing about what you 're saying you demand as a market ; there 's another thing about what we 're saying that we have affordability from taxpayers ' money to actually put into this ' . They also understand , John , that as well as an enabling policy—and we 're seeing the evidence , by the way ; I can cite it—of individuals who are being helped into more flexible options to get back into work , increase their hours and so on , this is also about building capacity in a fundamental foundation sector that is in every single part of Wales . The stuff that 's being debated ad nauseam here within the Assembly about foundational sectors— . The sector itself understands that if we boost the childcare offer in all its diversity , including , by the way , not just the independent sector but social enterprises and third-sector organisations , such as exist in Neath and elsewhere that I was involved in 20 or 30-odd years ago setting up—that has an economic impact that goes beyond that immediate family who are receiving the provision to the wider communities as well . They know that . They know there is job creation within this and there 's economic impact for that . So , it 's an open dialogue on what the rate should be rather than purely , 'Our wonks have crunched the numbers and we 've come up with £4.50 . ' Lynne Neagle AM : David , you had a question on the pilots . David Rees AM : Yes , just to finish that section off , if I may , Chair . Before I go to my question , I want to come back to Mark Reckless 's question and the answer you gave . I got the impression that if there is a need to look at different rates because of the higher-end areas , you may therefore have different sets of rates and not a universal rate . Is that also on the cards ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : David , it 's possible . I think our preference would be , I have to say , to stick with the universal rate , because we know it's— . There 's real simplicity and it 's been welcomed in the sector . But the sector , also , are quite pragmatic about this . One of the defining hallmarks of the way that we 've taken this scheme forward is learning in live time as we pilot and expand the pilots into different areas and different types of provision . If we learn lessons from that that suggest we need to come back and look at a differential in more-expensive-to-provide areas , then we 'll have to look at that , but there might be other ways of splicing it . But first of all , I think we have to go in and see how does this work . We might find , Mark , we might find , David , that we go in and when everything is tallied up , the £4.50 per hour works in supporting provision there . David Rees AM : Okay . In your answer to John , you talked about affordability , which I totally understand . If I can now remind you : I do n't remember the word 'affordability ' coming in the manifesto pledge of the Government . It was 'we will offer childcare facilities ' . So , I just want to put a reminder to you there . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Ministers always look at affordability . David Rees AM : Well , voters do n't . In the situation regarding Welsh-medium , you answered that a little bit earlier , but I have concerns about capacity . Workforce capacity you 've mentioned . To actually be registered you need staff who are qualified . There 's clearly a need to get more staff , because in your own paper you say that the report in 2016 said you do not have the childcare capacity in Wales at the moment . Do you believe that you can actually deliver the workforce to meet that capacity , first of all through the English medium , but secondly through the Welsh medium as well ? Because there 's a clear need to look at it . You talk about 30 by 2020 . By the way , 30 is nothing big when you consider the whole of Wales . Do you actually think you 've got that workforce capacity set up before this is fully rolled out ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : I hope , Chair , you 'll appreciate that in our submission to you we 've been very open . This is challenging . This is . To get to where we want to go is a huge challenge . Can we do it ? Yes we can . And I do n't say that glibly . Let me suggest some of the ways why . We have confidence that we can do this if everybody is working together across the sector , across the local authorities . Let me talk broadly about capacity , first of all , including English and Welsh-medium provision for children with complex needs , provision for children with disabilities—all of this . First of all , this is being— . The work that we 're doing to increase both capacity in terms of trained staff and qualified staff : we have the 10-year plan that I mentioned , which has already been announced . We 're working through it . We 're working through it with the sector . So , we 're identifying not only broadly at a national level where we need to develop those qualifications , but also at a regional , geographic level as well , and that 's being taken forward . We 've engaged with the 22 authorities—not just the pilot areas as well on this . So , beyond the pilot areas , we also have intense engagement . As you can see from what I 've said before , it 's rolling out progressively , but with all 22 authorities we 're working with them on their childcare sufficiency assessments to identify where their shortages are . David Rees AM : What have the pilot programmes actually shown you about this , and how are you going to move this forward ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Well , it 's precisely that . So , within the pilot areas , we have a greater depth of analysis now of where both the workforce and the physical provisions are . Whether those are maintained or non-maintained or third sector or school facilities or whatever , we 've got a much deeper granulation of identifying where that is , and we 're working , then , with those authorities , with the capital moneys that we 've allocated to this and the workforce development , and with local colleges , to develop the workforce and the physical constraints . But we 're also doing that with the other 22 , with all the 22 authorities as well , in anticipation of the wider roll-out . They 're not being left out of this . And by the way , it 's not only the Cardiffs and the Newports ; it 's all the other ones where there is n't full roll-out . We 're engaged with them deeply at the moment with that analysis on their childcare sufficiency assessments , both in terms of workforce , but also physical provision . So , we 're doing that already . We are looking as well , as this is rolled out , around the issue of co-location . Now , co-location is a fruitful way to look at future development . It does n't mean , by the way , that we exclude the third sector or social enterprise approach , or the independent sector , but co-location could be key to the roll-out of this in the right areas where it can be done , because then we avoid any fracture between the education hours and the childcare hours : the physical transportation of children from one location to another . So , we 're engaged with the 22 authorities on that : where could that be developed , who would be the providers that would do it and do they have the workforce to scale up to do it ? If not , how do they talk to local colleges to do that ? So , we 're doing that at the moment . I mentioned we 've put the £1 million additional funding into the meithrin over the next two years , targeting 40 new Welsh-medium groups by 2021 , which pretty much coincides with the full roll-out of this . It 's part of the aim of an additional 150 over the next decade of meithrin . So , all of those things , David , give us a confidence that we 're going to be in the right place . David Rees AM : But in particular , take the Welsh language—I understand Gwynedd , and I wo n't ask another question on that for obvious reasons at this point in time—but in some of the other areas where you 've piloted , you 've gone partial in some areas . When there 's Welsh language education , and the three to five-year-olds go to schools , they go from all areas of the council , basically . They do n't actually go necessarily from the local area , and therefore you 're getting a different picture . Have you been able to assess the actual impact , properly , upon the Welsh-medium side of things ? Because , for example , my grandchildren will go from my area , which may not be in one of the considerations , to a school that may be in that consideration , and that happens regularly . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Absolutely . We know that historically we 've got , across the country , a shortage of Welsh-language childcare provision—meithrin and so on—but we have not only a strategy in place , but the fact that we 've got local authorities now doing their own assessments within their area , across the piste of childcare , but also in terms of Welsh language , that means then that we can start filling those gaps with the money we 've put to it , and that includes in all parts of Wales , including those areas within south Wales and others that are less deep in their tradition of speaking Welsh over recent history , anyway , but where the demand for it is massive . So , local authorities are tasked with doing their own assessments of childcare sufficiency for this childcare offer . They 're identifying the gaps , David , and we will work with them and with providers to fill those gaps , and that includes with the umbrella organisations for Welsh language childcare provision . David Rees AM : And that 's the same for those children with physical disabilities or learning disabilities . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Absolutely the same . Absolutely the same . And this does mean , Chair , that it will be different , as it currently is in different areas : the type of provision , where the provision is located . But the provision should be there . This offer wo n't happen unless the provision is there for those children with complex needs , children with disabilities , Welsh language provision , as well as more generic provision as well , but it will be diverse in its provision around areas . Lynne Neagle AM : I do want to move on now , John , so if I can come back to your question . Llyr . Llyr Gruffydd AM : I would like to pick up on the last point , if I may . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Thank you . The investment in meithrin , of course , is one that we all welcome . A question from me though , the wider question , is : how do we mainstream Welsh medium into childcare ? Because , clearly , leaving it to meithrin is one way of doing it , but there 's a lot of existing infrastructure out there that we need to upskill in terms of the provision of Welsh medium . So , it 's not a question as such , but I 'm sure you recognise that—that there is a challenge there . Because if we are to get to where we want to get to , it is n't about growing meithrin , or Mudiad Ysgolion Meithrin ; it 's about mainstreaming Welsh-medium provision within the wider sector . So , it was n't a question after all . So , looking at the manifesto commitment that was made in 2016 , clearly the main or the principal aim of this policy is around removing some of the barriers to secure employment for parents , albeit with very positive outcomes for the children themselves , and we do n't ignore or neglect that at any cost . But I 'm just wondering : how would you then reconcile that with the findings of the Public Policy Institute for Wales report , which I mentioned to you yesterday , which was commissioned by the Government to look at policy options in this context , which concluded that there will be no 'substantial impacts on net income , poverty or work behaviour for families with children ' and that 'the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers in families with a child of target age is extremely small ' ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Well , the first thing I would say is that what we 're learning from the pilots is that it is having real-life impacts on parents , including in disadvantaged families , and we 're having this fed back from real-life situations on the ground , where parents are making different choices in the areas where it 's being piloted . So , the types of different choices they 're making could be to expand the number of hours that they 're in work , because they now have a choice , they 're not constrained to certain hours or whatever , they have a wider choice , with a wider number of providers , and they 're making that decision and they 're able to expand their hours . Some , by the way , Llyr , I have to say—and , again , these are real-life situations—are saying , 'What we 're doing is not expanding our hours , but , because of the increased provision of childcare and the increased offer , we are now able to actually spend more time with our children , because we 're adjusting our hours of work , based on the childcare provision offer . ' That in itself , I have to say , is a worthy aim . But I would say what we found out , in real-life examples—I 'm not saying that in direct contrast to what that paper was saying— Llyr Gruffydd AM : That 's what I was going to ask ; it sounds as if you 're saying they were wrong . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : But what we have is the advantage of this phased roll-out , where we are learning , live time , and I think the Arad report in October—we 're hoping to see the final report in October—will help put some flesh on this as well . It is already having an effect : the majority of parents who are taking advantage of this are actually in those groups that are below the average wage , they are making positive choices to get into this offer and to either expand , take more hours , adjust their own lifestyles around it or more . So , it 's having a positive effect . I can cite to you examples , because I 've asked my own officials on this , of families who tell us they 're saving up to £250 a week on the basis of this offer within the pilot areas , who 've increased their hours of employment , who 've changed their working patterns to suit their work life , but also to suit their families . Now , that 's real stuff , as opposed to—yes . Llyr Gruffydd AM : So , in effect , you are saying that the PPIW report got it wrong , basically . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : No , I 'm not saying that they got it wrong and it 's wholly wrong , but it is interesting , within that report , that it did identify that there were a range of factors here that play upon this . It 's not only the childcare ; it is the transport , it 's the training and education , it 's the employment support and all of those . And we agree with that , but we do think , and what we 're seeing , live time , at the moment—maybe at some point , somebody else will produce a report beyond the Arad report in October that will say , 'Well , actually , the way this is designed , that they 've done it in Wales , is having a material effect on those families , particularly the most disadvantaged families . ' Llyr Gruffydd AM : But you 're asking us to support a Bill here , albeit a framework Bill , to achieve a policy aim where you 're giving us anecdotal evidence that it 's having an impact , contrary to research that 's previously been done , albeit with promises that , maybe , an evaluation sometime in the autumn might tell us a different story . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We know , and we are constantly told—I 'm sure this is commonplace in constituency surgeries , as well—by parents who say that the biggest mitigating factor for them , actually , either going into work at an earlier opportunity or expanding their hours is purely the cost of childcare in front of them . We are picking up , even from the early term of the analysis— . I think our further reports , both Arad and as we go forward with the pilots , will substantiate this more . It 'll go beyond the anecdotal , it will show that parents are having an enhanced opportunity to balance their work life , to make better choices , either in terms of expanding the number of hours they 're working and increasing their disposable income within their families , or actually making it simply better for them in their family situation , where they do n't currently have that offer . So , I get the fact that we have one report out there , but it 's one report . It 's a report , and we 're not dismissing it entirely , but what we are saying is : we are now working with real-life piloting of an offer , and we are seeing the benefits coming through . As we roll this out , we 'll be back in front of this committee saying , 'Well , this is now what we 're finding . We can go beyond the real-life stories that I 'm relating to you now , and we can say , `` Well , here 's some hard data that goes with this , as well . '' ' Llyr Gruffydd AM : Okay . You reference in your paper , as well , another report , which is the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report , 'Starting Strong 2017 ' , and it highlights countries that have , maybe , the most similar childcare offer to what 's being proposed here in Wales . I 'm just wondering what assessment you 've made of those similarities , because , clearly , there 'll be different economic contexts in different countries and different levels of public expenditure , et cetera . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We have n't done really detailed analysis of comparisons with other countries far from Wales , but we will be doing work that will be doing some benchmarking against , where we can find similar models , where appropriate—do some appropriate benchmarking . What we have been doing is looking at what 's been happening across the border in England and trying to learn from the lessons there , and also the offer in Scotland as well , which are both close to hand . They 're in quite similar contexts . But we will do some work , Llyr , around benchmarking against good comparative international examples , where appropriate . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Yes , there we are , because one of my concerns was that the focus in a number of the countries in the OECD report are for nought to three-year-olds , whereas , of course , the policy focus here is for a slightly older age group . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , and I fully get that , but again , and I know it can be said , 'Well , this is an example ' but it 's real-life examples . We are having people who are telling us that they 're now making the choice to go to work earlier because this is extended to three-year-olds , but they would have delayed . There is a direct outcome there if this childcare offer enables somebody to say , 'Well , I 'm going to go a year earlier back into work and bring income into the family . ' Llyr Gruffydd AM : Okay . So , moving on , then , to the impact on the child and this whole question around school readiness , of course , which is an important one to address . Clearly , one of the main outcomes of this policy will be the academic performance of children , hopefully , later on in life . I want to come back to this point that the Children 's Commissioner for Wales and others have raised : the concern that , actually , the most disadvantaged—those from workless households—are being excluded from this policy . Is n't there therefore a risk that they 'll be left even further behind ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : I 've had long , detailed and positive discussions with the children 's commissioner on this , and I know the children 's commissioner would want a more universal offer , but I make two points on that : one is , that was not what the commitment in the manifesto was , and it 's not the offer that 's being taken forward now . It is a different thing , a universal offer , and there are issues around that with complexity , and also affordability . But it is n't the offer that we took forward into Government ; this is what we 're taking forward . But it is interesting in terms of that aspect of families then who lose out . I 'd say two significant things on it : one is , this does n't stand alone purely as 30 hours of childcare . Within this , there are 10 hours of the foundation years , educational input , which is there for everybody . But before that , particularly for those disadvantaged families , before we even get to that stage , you have schemes such as Flying Start , and I know this committee has looked in detail at Flying Start and has said that it would like to see it rolled out everywhere . If I had all the money under the sun , I would really do that , Chair ; I would really do it . But I do n't have all the money under the sun . Llyr Gruffydd AM : But you do have the ability to target the money . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , but the fact that Flying Start , we know , is leading to those outcomes where those children , in quite challenged circumstances very often , are more ready to step up to the foundation year , are more ready , then , to step through into mainstream education in later years—those things tie together . So , there are the 10 hours of education provision that sits here for every family , by the way , within this offer , let alone the childcare . That does n't mean that everybody 's excluded , but it does mean , yes , that this offer is focused on working parents . And we do n't think that that 's a bad thing . In fact , it does overlap with other offers that other political parties were taking forward into the last election , which was focusing on how we support the biggest thing that we often have in our constituency mailbags , which is , ' I ca n't afford to go back to work because I ca n't afford the childcare . Do n't tell me to go back to work , I ca n't afford it . ' Llyr Gruffydd AM : The majority of disadvantaged children do n't live in Flying Start areas , do they ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , indeed . Llyr Gruffydd AM : So , there 's a missing cohort there that ca n't access one or the other , and the school readiness gap is growing , and , really , are we focusing our resources in the right place here ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Well , yes , in terms of this scheme , but it does n't sit alone as this scheme—it 's the wider plethora of , I have to say , progressive and advanced initiatives that we have in Wales that take different forms . It 's not only Flying Start that provides that other support for parents , and readiness not only for the parents and for their children , but also the support into work . So , if , for example , you look at the Parents , Childcare and Employment programme , which is separate from this , there is support there for every parent in terms of helping them get supported into work from disadvantaged families . If you look at the support for the children , we 've got the 10 hours that sits within the sphere of the education , but we 've also got all the other family intervention programmes that help with socialisation , education and so on and so forth . If you look at this solely on its own and say , 'Well , there is nothing else there ; the rest of Wales is a desert and there 's no support for parents , for getting parents back into work or for those parents who are not seeking to go back into work but also need the support and for their children in education ' , I 'd be worried . But , actually , this fits as part of the jigsaw that we have in Wales , where I think we are well ahead of the other nations . Yes , we could do more , and I always say , Llyr ; I always say , Chair , that if I had—I do n't have a chequebook at all , because it 's not in my gift—if I had a blank cheque I 'd do a lot more , but we do n't . But what we can do is get the right schemes in place , and if this helps drive more choices for working parents , including , by the way— . There are niceties within this as well ; it does n't have to be that both parents are working . You could have a parent who is on incapacity benefit . You could have a parent who is a registered carer . They would qualify for the scheme . Those will be some of those most disadvantaged families that we both have those concerns about . So , there is some flexibility within this scheme as well to deal with some of those disadvantaged families . Lynne Neagle AM : Darren on this . Darren Millar AM : I am surprised by the answer there , particularly given that one of the ambitions of the Government is to close this attainment gap later in life when schoolchildren get to their examinations , when they 're 16 years old . Yet this appears to be driving a bigger wedge in terms of development , which could , of course , lead to a perverse outcome later on in life , but I do n't want to ask you about that . If I can just very quickly ask you : has consideration been given to making free childcare available to parents where they 're in 16 hours or more of education each week ? So , they may not be entering the labour market , but , of course , one of those barriers to them getting back into the labour market could well be their education , so what arrangements are in place there ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Darren , we have considered it , and we have n't included it within the scheme because this is designed to enable parents to go into work , not into training to enable them to get into work . There are other forms of support available for parents in terms of college and so on and so forth , but it 's not this scheme . Darren Millar AM : But it 's not prescribed support , is it ? You know , it 's not universally available to people who might be wanting to get back into the labour market over that barrier . You must have done some costings , then , if you 've considered it , and you must have tried to identify numbers . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : I 'm looking to my left and my right . Owain Lloyd : Not at this point . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We haven't— Darren Millar AM : So , you have n't considered it that much , have you ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We have actually considered— . We consider it from the point of , 'What is this scheme set up to do ? ' It 's very clear . When we ran , in the manifesto on this point— Darren Millar AM : I understand that . I do n't want you to repeat yourself because I know we are against the clock . But , very specifically , when you say you 've considered it , what you mean is you thought about it but you 've not costed it , you 've not identified the numbers that might be involved— Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Absolutely , absolutely . Darren Millar AM : And therefore you 've not considered whether it might be affordable in addition to the policy objective that this is trying to meet . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : No , Darren , you 're right : we have n't considered affordability because we 've considered it on first principles to do with what this offer is trying to do . It does n't fit within the offer so , as such , why would we do the costings ? Darren Millar AM : Perhaps I can frame my question in another way . Are you prepared to consider it if you 're able to identify the numbers and potential cost ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Ah , right , okay . We 'd be interested in your thoughts as a committee , but it does n't actually fit within the first principles of what the scheme is designed to do . Darren , can I just pick up on your point , in case you misinterpreted what I was saying to Llyr ? I drew attention in my answer to Llyr to schemes such as the PaCE scheme . In Gwynedd , one of our pilot areas , they are combining the Team Around the Family with this childcare offer . So , what they are doing is wrapping the support around . It is not the case , as you 've suggested then , that there is somehow more disadvantage being heaped on other families . What this does is tie in in those pilot areas with the existing provision , and that's the way we want to see it work . So , I would n't want you to be under any misapprehension that this makes conditions worse for families . Those families who have a registered carer in them where one parent works , and those families who have somebody on incapacity benefit will qualify for the scheme . All families will qualify for the 10 hours of education . In Gwynedd , they 're wrapping the Team Around the Family with this offer— Darren Millar AM : But on the other hand , Minister , you 've also suggested that this will accelerate child development for those kids who are able to access it , and yet not all kids will be able to access it , particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : But all children can access the 10 hours , and they can access Flying Start— Darren Millar AM : But 10 hours is very different to 30 hours , is it not ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , but they can access Flying Start or they can access the Team Around the Family— Darren Millar AM : If they 're in a Flying Start area . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : —or they can be in a children 's zone area or they can— Darren Millar AM : If they 're in those areas . Lynne Neagle AM : Right , I 've got John and then David , and the questions and answers are going to have to be brief , please . John Griffiths AM : Yes , certainly , Chair . In terms of child development and how this fits with wider Welsh Government strategy , Huw , I 'd be interested in what you 'd have to say about the quality of childcare . We 're talking a lot about quantity , but obviously we want to up quality , and that 's recognised by Welsh Government . They 've talked about increasing the qualifications within the workforce , and the quality . I just wonder how that sits within the £4.50 , because there could be pressures in the opposite direction there , and some tension between wanting to up the qualifications and quality of workforce whilst keeping affordability in place . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : John , you 're absolutely right , and two things on that : I visited one of the facilities in the Valleys the other day that was taking this forward—a very good independent sector-run childcare provision , with Welsh language and English language running alongside each other , and I asked the point about the integration , curiously , but what they were doing was— . Their standard of staff was an exemplar of what we 'd want to see : not only very well-qualified childcare staff who were qualified within not simply the child-minding but the wider child development aspects— . So , it was hard to differentiate , in some ways , what was happening there from what would be happening in a child development educational surrounding , and including the nutritional stuff and all of that . Now , that is the model we need to see , and the £4.50 seems to work , at the moment , for that . It 'll be interesting , as we discussed previously , as it goes forward— . We need to look at whether that works , going forward . But the quality , I think , is key , and that 's why we 're focused very much on registered inspected providers , as opposed to every Tom , Dick and Harriet . John Griffiths AM : If we want to increase salary levels , though , which I think is a necessary part of this picture of improving quality , then obviously that might impact on the £4.50 rate . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , indeed , and we are cognisant— . It 's interesting that we focus on whether the £4.50 is affordable , but the £4.50—you know , we 're having an interesting discussion internally about how that £4.50 offer per hour sits alongside others , such as the foundation phase offer , and it 's more generous . So , I think it 's : how do we align , as time goes by , the child development aspects of the whole early years stuff ? Now , we 're doing some fascinating work that I think I 've referred to on this committee before about aligning the early years development entirely . Now , this is an evolving piece of work , but I think the childcare offer should ultimately fit within that . How do you make sure that every offer that is Government-funded works on child development ? It 's not simply childcare . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay . Thank you . Right . The next questions are from Mark . Mark Reckless AM : In terms of child development and not accentuating disadvantage , another area where this may apply is the kids who are born in the summer term , compared to those who are born in Michaelmas . There 's a lot of evidence to suggest that they start with a disadvantage at school and often do n't make that up , even as they go through school . What is the rationale for providing the older children with five terms of this , compared to three terms for the younger children who already have the relative disadvantage ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : I 'm looking to my colleagues here and— Jo-Anne Daniels : Well , the criteria for eligibility for the offer are the term after the child 's third birthday , which is equivalent to the eligibility criteria for the foundation phase early education offer . Clearly , then , the number of terms that a child is able to , or parents are able to , access the childcare offer will be influenced by when the child is born , but I think you may be referring to a sort of parallel question , which is about whether— . There have been questions raised about whether children who are summer-born should , in fact , start school in the term after they turn four , or whether actually they should be allowed the flexibility to start school at a later age , which I know is something that has been tested in England , and there is some mixed evidence about school starting age and the birth month of children . Mark Reckless AM : Well , they do have flexibility . You do n't have to start your kids until the term following when they 're five . That 's the compulsory school— Jo-Anne Daniels : Well , that 's the legal position , but , obviously , in practice , most children will start school in the term after they 're four . Mark Reckless AM : So , given the disadvantage we know that the younger children born in the summer have , relative to the older ones , why accentuate that by giving the older kids five terms of this project , which you tell us will have such positive effects on their child development , but the summer kids only get three ? Doesn't that make the situation worse ? Jo-Anne Daniels : I 'm not 100 per cent sure I understand the question . So , children will stop being in receipt of the childcare offer once they become eligible for a full-time school place , and most children will become eligible for a full-time school place in the term after their fourth birthday . Mark Reckless AM : But the older kids become eligible for this five terms before they start school , where the younger kids , who 're already disadvantaged , become eligible for it only three terms before , accentuating the problem , surely . Could more thought be given to this issue ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We 'll take that away . It 's confused us a little bit , but we 'll take that away . We might need to come back to you and— . Yes . Lynne Neagle AM : If you could write to us about that , that would be helpful . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes . Mark Reckless AM : Thank you . Minister , you got , or Welsh Government , really , got the Public Policy Institute for Wales to study this proposed policy and they concluded that it would have no substantial impacts on net income , poverty or work behaviour for families with children , and that the impact on work participation and work hours for mothers and families with a child of target age is extremely small . What do you say to that ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Well , Mark , I can only refer to what I said earlier . Our real-life evidence that is accumulating now is showing us examples of where people are making savings and increasing disposable income—as I mentioned earlier , up to £250 per week within some poorer households ; so , real-life examples—but also where it 's enabling them to make much better choices about when they work because there 's more childcare offer available , or , alternatively , to work their childcare provision and their working hours around being able to spend more time with their children , which they currently ca n't do . Lynne Neagle AM : And I do n't want to go back over Llyr 's questions . Mark Reckless AM : I understand . That 's not my focus . I just wondered about the quality of this PPIW piece of work . They said if you had a work requirement , as you do , it would cost £61 million a year on their numbers , substantially less than you 're saying , and then they said it would cost £144 million without a work requirement . Now , that implies to me that 57 per cent of the parents would n't be working and would continue not working even if there is this available with a work requirement . I mean , are those numbers really credible from PPIW ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : It 's not quite comparing like with like . Just to draw your attention , Mark , and the committee 's attention to that the PPIW analysis was looking at a provision of 38 weeks . Ours is a 48-week option . And the fact that we are having parents already saying to us that their ability to actually extend that into the 48 weeks—beyond the term time and so on—carries advantages that are not picked up in that report . Mark Reckless AM : And what is your early assessment of the income levels of families who are finding this offer most attractive ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : I think , from recollection , we 're one term in , so we 're one term into the assessment , and I mentioned earlier that the majority of parents are below the average income of £26,000 in Wales— it 's around about 60 per cent of families are those . We 're finding very few families are those who are on higher incomes . It 's disproportionately towards those below the average income , and many of them amongst the most disadvantaged families are opting in to this offer where it is being offered . So , clearly , they 're seeing the benefits of it . Mark Reckless AM : And what consideration have you given to integrating this Welsh Government offer with the UK Government offer of tax-free childcare that 's applicable across the UK ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Well , that offer , as you rightly say , is available across the UK and still is . The fact that it 's more integrated within their scheme within England—the tax offer is more integrated—has caused them some problems in complexity and in the administration of this and the digital platforms that they 've had . That offer is still available in Wales and it might well be that parents who opt in to that say , 'Well , we do want to buy additional hours beyond the 30 hours ' , but this 30 hours is there for every— Mark Reckless AM : I wonder , Minister , whether what you 're doing , in a very good way , to promote your project—people will see that as the childcare offer and , at least in my experience , very few parents are aware of the tax-free childcare on a UK basis . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : You 're right—sorry . That 's absolutely one of the lessons we 've learnt from even this early stage of the early implementers , because there are elements of a childcare offer within the tax offer , within universal credit , within working tax credit . There are little bits of different ones and it does cause confusion . So , one of the lessons that we 've learnt from the Talk Childcare communication strategy alongside this is the importance of communicating to parents and providers who the parents go to what is best for them to access , how they access it easily , and we 'll learn more as these pilots roll by . Mark Reckless AM : So , as you go into the Her Majesty 's Revenue and Customs criteria—you have a £100,000 cap , as well as the £6,000 minimum wage cap , and you 're getting HMRC to say whether people are eligible , which requires them to set up that account with HMRC—will you assure this committee that you will make sure that parents who are doing that are aware of the UK tax-free childcare offer , and that their providers also are ? Because we 've been looking , say , at the £7.50 extra per day , but , if someone 's eligible for this offer , they should also be eligible for the UK tax-free childcare offer and have set up the account to do that . So , will you make sure that those parents know to pay their provider out of tax-free funds , rather than paying them the fully taxed amounts , which might otherwise happen ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , absolutely . And I think , if it 's okay , Owain would like to add something as well . Owain Lloyd : Yes , just to say , as I understand how things currently work with the English offer and TFC , when a parent applies , that automatically happens in terms of , on the one hand , they 're given a 'yes ' or 'no ' in terms of their eligibility for the 30-hours offer in England , but they will also be told in terms of the parental account that 's set up under TFC . So , that is integrated in the offer , and we 'll be looking to do the same in terms of the Welsh offer . But , obviously , what we 're not looking at doing in terms of the 30-hours offer is the setting up of the parental account to make the payment ; the payment currently is very much between local government and the provider directly , rather than the TFC model , where the parent pays the provider . Mark Reckless AM : Thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . Okay . Well , we have come to—well , we 've run over , actually . So , we 've come to the end of our time . Can I thank the Minister and the officials for attending ? You are , of course , back with us on 16 May for Stage 1 of the Bill , so we will look forward to seeing you then . You will be sent a transcript to check for accuracy , as is usual practice . But thank you again , all of you . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Lovely . Thank you—diolch yn fawr . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , item 3 then is papers to note . As Members can see , there are 11 papers to note . So , if Members are content , I 'd suggest that we note all of them in a block , if that 's okay . Yes , okay . Thank you . Item 4 , then . Can I propose , in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 , that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting ? Are Members content ? Okay . Thank you . 
Query : Summarize the discussion about the early implementer areas . Hefin David AM : Good morning , Minister . How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas , and is it something of a mixed bag ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : It 's gone well , but I 'm glad we 've done it through this process of early implementer , actually piloting it , because we 're learning lessons as we go along . It has gone well . It 's been encouraging , to the extent that we 're at the point where we 're expanding—we 've made announcements on expanding some of the early implementer areas so we can learn more lessons . But , in terms of what we 're learning , one is the bureaucracy around the current approach that we 're taking , because it 's being done on the seven early implementers . So , we 're asking parents to come in , provide their wage slips , provide the birth certificates , and so on . You 're dealing sometimes with parents and families with complex issues and complex backgrounds , so it 's difficult . And the burden of administration on that is falling to each pilot area . In one case , it 's a whole authority , but it 's only one—that 's in Blaenau Gwent . In others , it 's smaller areas . So , we 're also hitting those— . The other big challenge we 're hitting is communication . So , we 're having parents , generally , who are outside the areas entirely saying , 'Why have n't we got this yet ? Can we please get into it ? ' , which is encouraging . But the other thing we 're having is people who are within pilot authorities , where it does n't extend to the whole authority , saying , 'Well , hold on now , we think we qualify for something under universal care , we think we qualify for something on tax credits . Why do n't we qualify for this ? ' 'Well , you 're not in the pilot area . ' So , we 're learning about these things , but the biggest one , I have to say , is the administrative burden , and I think that 's interesting in how we take this forward for a wider roll-out . Hefin David AM : What is the administrative burden ? What specifically is that ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : It is that sheer burden on each local authority , and each pilot area , to administer a scheme where we are asking parents to prove eligibility , to bring in documents to prove their eligibility , to make adjustments as it goes forward based on what their changing work patterns are , what their salary slips say . It 's incredibly bureaucratic . So , yesterday , when we made the statement following the announcement of the introduction of the Childcare Funding ( Wales ) Bill , we made clear that our preferred option , as put within that framework Bill , is actually to build on , and to learn from the lessons as well , the model of the HM Revenue and Customs type of model , where you actually have—and this , by the way , is supported by local authority providers out there—one system that is a centralised system , where there is clarity , that is handled , that has elements of information sharing between Government departments , such as the Department for Work and Pensions , and so on , so that the work is done for the parents , and the work is done for the local authorities ; much cleaner , much simpler . Hefin David AM : How confident are you that you can achieve that by 2020 ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We are very confident . But , as I say , I 'm more confident in the fact that we 're actually piloting it , and phasing this in , because I think we 've learned from some of the experiences elsewhere , including just over the border in England , where they have a different version of a childcare offer , but they 've gone for it in a big-bang approach . And it has led to technical issues , it 's led to volume issues , where their anticipation of how many people would buy into it was overwhelmed by the numbers who actually then came forward for it , and the complexity , I have to say , of individual family situations , whereas what we are doing , Hefin , is taking this forward very , very carefully . Each roll-out , each expansion that we 're doing of the pilot is not—and I know this has caused some people to come back and say , 'Why ca n't we all have it now ? ' It 's because we 're only rolling out to areas where we now need to learn a lesson about whether it 's rurality or , as it will be within densely urban areas , where the cost might be slightly higher , and that 's allowing us to have the confidence that we 'll have it . We 've expanded the whole offer across Gwynedd—the whole of Gwynedd , Anglesey and Caerphilly . Flintshire now have a cross-authority offer . Rhondda Cynon Taf is anticipating doing this by September . Swansea is planning to do it , they tell us , in due course—in short order—as well . So , we have the confidence now that , with that learning going on from different pilot areas , we 'll have the full roll-out by 2020 . Hefin David AM : Is it true to say that , in the early adopter areas , the intensity of demand for the services is not spread evenly across ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Absolutely . Hefin David AM : And why is that ? Is that going to cause a problem across Wales ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : No , it wo n't cause a problem . If we were doing this tomorrow , it would cause a problem , but what we 're learning is that there are some economic issues and then there are some cultural issues . So , there are issues to do with— . It 's not capacity , by the way . We 're not finding a problem here with capacity , whether it 's in English language provision or whether it 's in Welsh language provision , whether it 's in children with complex needs , we 're not finding that as an issue . But what we are finding is , for example , one of the well-known ones—and I 've spoken about this before—is that , in some of the south Wales Valleys constituencies , there is a family tradition of doing childcare within the families . I 've done it myself . Grandparents , aunts , uncles and so on provide free , unregistered , unlicensed childcare of a sort . Now that is n't what the scheme is about , by the way , I have to say . So , some of the aspects are cultural , but what we 're also doing alongside this , whilst looking at the capacity and looking at how we learnt from the pilot roll-out , is that communication with parents and providers and local authorities as well . So , we have a whole programme running alongside it . It 's about communicating what the offer is , how simple it is to get invovled in this and where they go to , and , critically , I think , how we do that national roll-out would be important as well . 
Query : What were the two lessons that can be learned from early implementer areas ? Hefin David AM : Good morning , Minister . How has it gone in the early implementer local authority areas , and is it something of a mixed bag ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : It 's gone well , but I 'm glad we 've done it through this process of early implementer , actually piloting it , because we 're learning lessons as we go along .

Query : Summarize the discussion about the childcare offer . Hefin David AM : So , given the point you 've made about grandparents and family , would n't it be sensible , then , to offer a subsidy to grandparents to provide this kind of care ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Unregistered grandparents ? Hefin David AM : Well , through some kind of analysis of that . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Well , we do n't think so and there are good reasons behind this . Hefin David AM : Is it because you say that they would n't be registered as carers for their own family member ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , but there 's a deeper reason behind that registration as well . The childcare offer is n't only to just provide childcare ; it 's the wider aspects that come with this . This childcare offer ties into the foundation years offer . There 's an element of education linked to the childcare offer—there 's that 10 hours of the early education foundation years as well . The two tie together . So , there 's an issue here with quality , about socialisation and how children learn in an environment , as opposed to purely—as great as all our grandparents and aunts and uncles are—simply child-minding . That 's one important distinction . So , the focus of this scheme is very much on registered licensed providers , which could be , by the way—because we do have them , and we 're discussing this at the moment internally and with the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years and others—grandparents who are actually registered and inspected by the care inspectorate ? We 're having those discussions . Hefin David AM : How many of them are there ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We do n't think there is a huge number , but we 're trying to bottom this out at the moment . We have n't got the exact number , but we do n't think they are huge numbers , but there are , in our constituencies , registered , licensed , inspected grandparents who look after other people 's children in a little group of four or five or six or seven , but also their own grandchildren . Hefin David AM : So , they 're a kind of grandparents club . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes . Now that , I would say to you—and I know that Darren raised this on the floor yesterday as well—is markedly different in the nature of it , because it's registered and licensed , than simply informal grandparents or aunts or uncles . I say that as well because we also get people who will say to us , ' I don't want to be paid for looking after my grandchildren ; I look after my grandchildren because I look after them ' . Hefin David AM : And what about the view , given that you said that capacity was n't an issue , of the National Day Nurseries Association , which says that Wales has the most fragile childcare sector in Great Britain ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : I do n't agree we have the most fragile , but the childcare offer gives us an opportunity to make it more resilient and more robust . We know from the early piloting , and as we roll it out , that there is the immense diversity within the childcare sector , and we 're talking about everything from those very small terraced homes that have been licensed and registered to take six or seven children , to large , complex environments that perhaps are on maintained premises within school premises , provided by a voluntary or third sector organisation . So , there 's immense complexity and we know that that differs across Wales , and we also know there 's immense regional variation in the scale and the type of childcare offer . What the roll-out allows us to do , backed by £60 million of capital money behind it , in terms of capital development of childcare facilities , backed by a 10-year workforce development plan for childcare—and bear in mind this is bolted in as part of our foundational economy approach as well—that means , by 2020 , we get to the point where we 're putting the money into the capital development but also to the workforce development , because in some areas we 're finding it 's not to do with lack of provision and facilities , it 's to do with lack of staff . In other areas , we 're finding there are plenty of staff but not the adequate facilities . We 've got to get it right . Hefin David AM : That 's fair enough , but is it realistic to think that there 's going to be capacity growth in the next two to three years to deliver the product ? Is that realistic to think that that foundational sector can provide that level of staffing ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , I think it is , absolutely , because , again , what we 're finding is we 've got several things going on at once in terms of how we monitor and assess the development of this roll-out . One is the work that we 're doing on the ground with the phased roll-out , so we 're literally learning live time , and I have pretty much weekly or fortnightly updates on how things are going , but also there is a termly update as well . We 've also commissioned additional work from Arad to look at this first phase of the roll-out that we 've done to see what that tells us as well . But the feedback that we 're getting from the childcare providers themselves , on the basis that we 're now identifying where either the gaps in the workforce or the physical facilities are , is that , 'Yes , we can do this ' , because we 're putting the money in , we have the strategy for the workforce development , and it 's not going to be the same in all parts of Wales . It 's not as if what we 're saying is , 'Here 's what we 're going to do all of a sudden—flick a switch and we have a universality of the same type of provision everywhere . ' So , let me give you one key example . Alongside this , alongside the £60 million capital fund , alongside the workforce development , we 've also identified a separate strain of money into cylch meithrin . We know that there is a shortage in parts of Wales for Welsh language childcare development . We 're specifically putting money into developing that , and , in fact , the first one of those will be , from that new tranche of money , opening up , I think , in September . They anticipate , as part of our big strategy with Welsh language development , we 'll have an additional 40 of those by— Jo-Anne Daniels : Thirty . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : It 's an additional 30 by 2020 , and an additional doubling of that in the 10 years after that . We ca n't take this for granted , Hefin . This is difficult . This is hard work , but we have everything in place to make it happen .

Query : What did Huw Irranca-Davies think about the capacity in the next several years to deliver the product when talking about childcare offer ?

Query : Summarize the discussion about hourly rates of the service . Hefin David AM : The last thing from me : the £4.50 single national rate—is there a danger that we might be creating a kind of EasyJet-style nursery provision where you get the basics but the wealthier parents are going to be able to pay for better care within those settings because of the add-ons ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We really mulled over this a lot and discussed it , I have to say , not only internally but with childcare providers out there and with parents as well and with local authorities . The first thing to say is the £4.50 rate that we 've set has been welcomed , and it 's been welcomed because it 's unlike the much more complex offer that 's in England , where there 's a variable rate and there are lots of determining factors on it and it 's added complexity and confusion . Hefin David AM : Can I just ask there , it 's been welcomed perhaps in Blaenau Gwent , but has it been equally welcomed in Cardiff ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : No , because we have n't rolled it out in Cardiff yet , and that is a salient point . Hefin David AM : Okay , fair enough . But will it be , then ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , it will be . Some of the more expensive areas like Cardiff and Newport are knocking on our door saying , 'Please can we have this offer ? ' , and we are keen to give it to them . But , as I say— Hefin David AM : But do you anticipate a capacity problem with the £4.50 in those areas , compared to , say , the Cynon valley ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We ca n't anticipate it yet , Hefin , but that 's exactly the reason for going into that area and then assessing how it works . We 're reasonably confident that the £4.50— . We 're reasonably assured by the feedback that we 're having that the £4.50 might work as a universal amount . But if we learn , when we roll it out in Cardiff and Newport , that there needs to be some variation , we can look at that , because we 're not doing a big-bang approach . So , that is part of why we will move to roll it out within Cardiff and Newport and other more expensive areas and learn from it , but at the moment , I have to say , the £4.50 amount has been welcomed—it 's appropriate . You touched on the other aspect , though , of the wider aspects of beyond the £4.50 , because the £4.50 does n't cover everything . The £4.50 is a contribution towards the wraparound childcare element but it does n't cover—and we agonised over this—the issues of things like transport out on trips or food or snacks and things like this . Now , we did agonise a number of things that brought us to the conclusion where we are . I have to say , this has n't been ivory-tower stuff ; it 's been in discussion with the providers but also parents . One : parents are quite used to—with childcare settings and play care settings and so on—the idea that providers are quite different . Some providers charge a fee that does everything in one ; others provide simply the childcare element but they tell the parents—and I 'm used to this as a parent myself , although mine are older now—'Mr Irranca-Davies , when you sign on , just to be aware , if we do take your kids down to St Fagans , there 's going to be a little bit of a charge for that ' and so on . Hefin David AM : That 's fair enough , but it would be the lowest-income working families who would be most unduly affected by that , because the higher income families would be able to afford those add-ons , the lower income ones wo n't . Is n't that a concern ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : If money was absolutely no object , then I think you 'd be looking at quite a different offer , but it has to be affordable within what we 've got as well . The fact that parents , including those who are on lower incomes , are used to currently discriminating between providers , not only with childcare settings but also within school settings as well , where very often schools now will say , 'We 're doing something extra'— Hefin David AM : That may be the case , but it 's not fair , is it ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : In a pure argument about equity , and if funding was no object and if the burdens of austerity were released and we were told we had money—'You can do what you want'—I think you 'd be looking at a very different approach . But within what we have , I think this works very , very well indeed , because it 's very transparent for parents who are used to making these decisions . It says , 'Here you have 10 hours of the foundation education offer . You have the additional hours here provided with the childcare offer . But within those additional hours , you may be with a local provider in the middle of Powys that actually says , `` Within that we provide everything '' ; you may be with a provider that says , `` Well , actually , we do a whistles and bells thing and we take them out on trips , but it 's up to you if you want to come , and here 's the additional cost— '' . ' Parents are used to making that decision and realistically , in terms of what we can do with this offer , this is actually—the arguments around this have been well rehearsed both with providers and with parents and we 're not getting any concerns that this is going to unnecessarily disadvantage . In a total fairness argument , would you make it universal and with no additional charges ? Well , possibly you would . But we work within the realistic— Hefin David AM : Or have a lower top-end income limit . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Depending on how the Bill progresses in the main Chamber and when it goes through committee , there 's that flexibility built into the Bill that those things can be looked at over time and adjusted . For the moment , I think there is an attraction , in terms of the upper limit , of saying : one—'Let 's try not to add additional complexity , let 's go with a scheme that 's already working its way through the system , which is , if you like , what they 're doing in England , and not add additional complexity . But , secondly , there is an appeal to universality , curiously , in saying to all parents—and I say this regardless of political hues across the committee here—there 's an attraction when you say , 'Let 's make an offer focused on working parents as it is ' , as universal to those working parents as possible , and avoid the administrative costs of saying , 'Well , let 's take the upper limit down to £80 or £60 or £55 . ' There 's always the question of how much additional cost is incurred in actually doing that tweak of complexity . We have looked at it . Lynne Neagle AM : Darren on this . Darren Millar AM : Just to ask , I mean , the labour market costs are changing , are n't they ? You 've got the national living wage increasing— [ Inaudible . ] —that 's going to have a bearing , is n't it , on the affordability of this project in terms of the childcare offer and the suitability of the £4.50 per hour regime ? By the time it 's fully rolled out , of course , that £4.50 rate is going to be a number of years old , for example . Do you have plans to review that ? Where is it headed ? Because it 's certainly not going to be enough in the future . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : It depends how far in the future you 're looking . I have to say , the feedback that we 're having at the moment from organisations like the Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years and from the National Day Nurseries Association Wales and others is that this is the right rate and it 's suitable not only today but for the foreseeable future of rolling this out . Darren Millar AM : But they 've raised concerns about the national living wage implications , have n't they , as well ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Of course , and I think it 's incumbent on us as well to not— Darren Millar AM : So , it 's not fair to say that they have n't raised concerns about the rate . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , but what they 're not arguing for at the moment is for this rate to be raised . Darren Millar AM : But they have suggested that in meetings— Huw Irranca-Davies AM : That in future— Darren Millar AM : Absolutely . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Well , of course , in future , any Minister , any committee , will want to come back and look at—is the hourly rate , as one element of the scheme , appropriate to the current financial challenges for the sector , and not least , by the way , as we try not only to develop the workforce , but to develop the career pathways through this as well ? And I think that 's the right discussion to be had , live time , as this is taken forward . But at this moment in time , we 're not getting people saying within this part of the roll-out that we need to adjust this amount . Darren Millar AM : So , have you forecasted for any adjustment in the rate going forward in terms of affordability of the project ? Because you 've still got this £100 million price tag on it , have n't you ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Similar to the point that was raised with Hefin about Cardiff and Newport , if we identify that the rate is not appropriate , if it's— . I do n't think anybody 's going to come back to us and say that it 's too little . But do bear in mind that it 's above where the average England rate is , even though there 's this complex variability within the English rate that has caused some confusion there , which is why the universal rate with us has been welcomed . If we find , as we pilot it , or if we find because there are more expensive areas for it to be delivered in , there needs to be adjustment , then we 'll be back in front of the committee arguing why that needs to be the case . Darren Millar AM : But that wo n't put the project at risk in terms of its finances ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : No , no . We are still very confident , looking forward , on the best projections we have , fed by the live input that 's coming in from the pilot , which will be fed again in the autumn—the Arad report coming forward—that we have not only the capacity to actually deliver this—challenging as this is , we have the capacity to deliver it—but also that the funding that 's available , on our best estimate—the estimate we 've stood by , that broad ball park of that £100 million figure—it 's deliverable within that . But if it changes , we will come back . And if it changes , I 'll have to be sitting down with my boss , Vaughan Gething , and with Mark Drakeford , to argue the case on it . But at this moment , we have confidence and we 've run the rule across this repeatedly . But that rate , combined with the other elements of this childcare offer—there is sufficient there allocated to actually deliver the whole roll-out . Lynne Neagle AM : Mark on this . Mark Reckless AM : Minister , as a parent who 's been researching childcare options , it 's obvious to me that in Cardiff , and to a degree in Newport and Monmouthshire , costs are substantially higher than this , and I haven't been able to find anywhere that has a six-hour day for £27 , which is implied by your rate . Is n't it the case that rents and wages are higher and therefore you 're going to need a higher rate to make it work ? Is n't that already obvious ? Why are you postponing coming back and looking at this until some point in the future ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Chair , my biggest fear is a parent who 's actually involved in this area already , but , having been one myself— . Mark , you may be right , that 's exactly why we 're piloting it and that 's why when we pilot in Cardiff and Newport , we know we have lessons to learn over the affordability and the £4.50 per hour rate . Mark Reckless AM : But you 're not piloting it in any of the high-cost areas that I 've referred to . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : No . We will be . We are going to be . Mark Reckless AM : When are you starting ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Cardiff and Newport—September . Owain Lloyd : This September . Mark Reckless AM : This September ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes . So , we 're not missing any of these learning experiences and we know that— . The reason we 've gone for the other areas first , by the way—please take this back to any authorities affected—is simply because we 've done deep dives into areas that vary from very rural areas in mid Wales , areas in north Wales , areas around Welsh language provision , areas in deep valleys , understanding the cultural and the economic impacts . So , we 've held back a little bit from going into what we know is an obvious challenge within the more expensive areas of provision . But it 's coming , it 's imminent , and we 'll learn the lessons from it . And do you know , you may be right ? And if you are right , that it 's more expensive , and we need a higher rate within those areas , then we 're going to have to come back and discuss it with the committee . But let 's go in and learn it first of all , rather than assume it necessarily . Lynne Neagle AM : Just before I bring David in on the issue that Hefin raised about the chargeable items , your paper says that providers can charge up to £7.50 a day for food , snacks , transport and consumables such as nappies . Now , that 's £37.50 a week , which is a lot of money for parents , and I just wondered if you wanted to comment on that figure ? But also , do you think there 's a risk that providers who maybe are n't charging at the moment may start charging because of any new pressures that arise because of this scheme ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : I think they 're the right areas to flag up , and if I thought that was going to happen I 'd be concerned as we take this forward and design this scheme . I think part of the evaluation from Arad will also show us that—whether or not , within the pilot areas that we are already in , which are quite diverse , that is happening . We 're only one term into learning the lessons , by the way , but I would want to make sure that we design a scheme where we are not heaping on disadvantage or where there was exploitation of disadvantaged families . So , the early evaluation , I think , will give us good feedback on that . I think also , by the way , that providers know that this is a collaborative effort to do this here . It 's not in their interests , I have to say , as the umbrella bodies or individual providers , to see this as some way that they can unduly rake in additional income from this on the backs of poorer families . This is about providing opportunities for all working families . But especially , I have to say , the early evaluation that we 've seen already suggests that the greatest proportion of those who are taking advantage of this scheme in the early parts—in the early evaluation—are those who are below the average working wage within in Wales . That 's by far the greatest number of people who are doing it , and we do n't want them then being priced out because of add-ons . So , there has to be some pragmatism , I have to say , and some open partnership working here with the sector , and we do have that . Lynne Neagle AM : John on this . John Griffiths AM : I want to come back to the £4.50 rate , but in terms of working with the sector , briefly , if I might , Chair , I just wonder , Huw , in terms of that £4.50 figure and understanding the sector in Wales , to what extent are we talking about a market rate and to what extent are we talking about the increase in demand that will come from the scheme and how that relates to economies of scale and capacity ? Is it purely a market rate or is there a conversation with the sector in terms of the benefits that will come from this scheme and how they should be recognised in terms of setting the rate ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : This has been a very open dialogue with the sector around affordability , around the hourly rate and around what might happen in future as well . This is not a pure hard data-driven analysis that says , 'Here we 've calculated everything and this is the rate that will satisfy it ' , because we recognise that there 's great diversity in provision out there , and we also recognise that things will change over time . It 's not only the geographical diversity—it 's the diversity of the sector itself . I think we need to , as we take this scheme forward and look at the full roll-out , continue in that very open dialogue with the sector not about what is purely a market-driven amount but actually what is also affordable for the Welsh Government within the constraints that we have . Just to flag up one issue , it 's right that we 're focusing on those elements that are n't included within it , to some extent as well , and the effect of that on more disadvantaged families , but that has to be balanced with the pocket of affordability for this scheme as well . Let me give you a clear illustration : some of our calculations have suggested that if we included free food within this offer as well , it would add something like in the region of 50p to that £4.50 rate . That would have , at this moment , impacts on the affordability of this and the roll-out of it . I would need to be going back to my seniors and arguing the case now , okay ? But , it 's that open dialogue with the sector that says , 'There 's one thing about what you 're saying you demand as a market ; there 's another thing about what we 're saying that we have affordability from taxpayers ' money to actually put into this ' . They also understand , John , that as well as an enabling policy—and we 're seeing the evidence , by the way ; I can cite it—of individuals who are being helped into more flexible options to get back into work , increase their hours and so on , this is also about building capacity in a fundamental foundation sector that is in every single part of Wales . The stuff that 's being debated ad nauseam here within the Assembly about foundational sectors— . The sector itself understands that if we boost the childcare offer in all its diversity , including , by the way , not just the independent sector but social enterprises and third-sector organisations , such as exist in Neath and elsewhere that I was involved in 20 or 30-odd years ago setting up—that has an economic impact that goes beyond that immediate family who are receiving the provision to the wider communities as well . They know that . They know there is job creation within this and there 's economic impact for that . So , it 's an open dialogue on what the rate should be rather than purely , 'Our wonks have crunched the numbers and we 've come up with £4.50 . ' Lynne Neagle AM : David , you had a question on the pilots . David Rees AM : Yes , just to finish that section off , if I may , Chair . Before I go to my question , I want to come back to Mark Reckless 's question and the answer you gave . I got the impression that if there is a need to look at different rates because of the higher-end areas , you may therefore have different sets of rates and not a universal rate . Is that also on the cards ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : David , it 's possible . I think our preference would be , I have to say , to stick with the universal rate , because we know it's— . There 's real simplicity and it 's been welcomed in the sector . But the sector , also , are quite pragmatic about this . One of the defining hallmarks of the way that we 've taken this scheme forward is learning in live time as we pilot and expand the pilots into different areas and different types of provision . If we learn lessons from that that suggest we need to come back and look at a differential in more-expensive-to-provide areas , then we 'll have to look at that , but there might be other ways of splicing it . But first of all , I think we have to go in and see how does this work . We might find , Mark , we might find , David , that we go in and when everything is tallied up , the £4.50 per hour works in supporting provision there . David Rees AM : Okay . In your answer to John , you talked about affordability , which I totally understand . If I can now remind you : I do n't remember the word 'affordability ' coming in the manifesto pledge of the Government . It was 'we will offer childcare facilities ' . So , I just want to put a reminder to you there . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Ministers always look at affordability . 
Query : What did Huw Irranca-Davies think about the affordability of lowest-income working families when talking about hourly rates of the service ? Hefin David AM : But do you anticipate a capacity problem with the £4.50 in those areas , compared to , say , the Cynon valley ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We ca n't anticipate it yet , Hefin , but that 's exactly the reason for going into that area and then assessing how it works . We 're reasonably confident that the £4.50— . We 're reasonably assured by the feedback that we 're having that the £4.50 might work as a universal amount . But if we learn , when we roll it out in Cardiff and Newport , that there needs to be some variation , we can look at that , because we 're not doing a big-bang approach . So , that is part of why we will move to roll it out within Cardiff and Newport and other more expensive areas and learn from it , but at the moment , I have to say , the £4.50 amount has been welcomed—it 's appropriate . You touched on the other aspect , though , of the wider aspects of beyond the £4.50 , because the £4.50 does n't cover everything . The £4.50 is a contribution towards the wraparound childcare element but it does n't cover—and we agonised over this—the issues of things like transport out on trips or food or snacks and things like this . Now , we did agonise a number of things that brought us to the conclusion where we are . I have to say , this has n't been ivory-tower stuff ; it 's been in discussion with the providers but also parents .

Some providers charge a fee that does everything in one ; others provide simply the childcare element but they tell the parents—and I 'm used to this as a parent myself , although mine are older now—'Mr Irranca-Davies , when you sign on , just to be aware , if we do take your kids down to St Fagans , there 's going to be a little bit of a charge for that ' and so on . Hefin David AM : That 's fair enough , but it would be the lowest-income working families who would be most unduly affected by that , because the higher income families would be able to afford those add-ons , the lower income ones wo n't . Is n't that a concern ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : If money was absolutely no object , then I think you 'd be looking at quite a different offer , but it has to be affordable within what we 've got as well . The fact that parents , including those who are on lower incomes , are used to currently discriminating between providers , not only with childcare settings but also within school settings as well , where very often schools now will say , 'We 're doing something extra'— Hefin David AM : That may be the case , but it 's not fair , is it ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : In a pure argument about equity , and if funding was no object and if the burdens of austerity were released and we were told we had money—'You can do what you want'—I think you 'd be looking at a very different approach .

Query : What did Huw Irranca-Davies think about the pilots in Cardiff and Newport ? Mark Reckless AM : Minister , as a parent who 's been researching childcare options , it 's obvious to me that in Cardiff , and to a degree in Newport and Monmouthshire , costs are substantially higher than this , and I haven't been able to find anywhere that has a six-hour day for £27 , which is implied by your rate . Is n't it the case that rents and wages are higher and therefore you 're going to need a higher rate to make it work ? Is n't that already obvious ? Why are you postponing coming back and looking at this until some point in the future ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Chair , my biggest fear is a parent who 's actually involved in this area already , but , having been one myself— . Mark , you may be right , that 's exactly why we 're piloting it and that 's why when we pilot in Cardiff and Newport , we know we have lessons to learn over the affordability and the £4.50 per hour rate . Mark Reckless AM : But you 're not piloting it in any of the high-cost areas that I 've referred to . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : No . We will be . We are going to be . Mark Reckless AM : When are you starting ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Cardiff and Newport—September . Owain Lloyd : This September . Mark Reckless AM : This September ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes . So , we 're not missing any of these learning experiences and we know that— . The reason we 've gone for the other areas first , by the way—please take this back to any authorities affected—is simply because we 've done deep dives into areas that vary from very rural areas in mid Wales , areas in north Wales , areas around Welsh language provision , areas in deep valleys , understanding the cultural and the economic impacts . So , we 've held back a little bit from going into what we know is an obvious challenge within the more expensive areas of provision . But it 's coming , it 's imminent , and we 'll learn the lessons from it . And do you know , you may be right ? And if you are right , that it 's more expensive , and we need a higher rate within those areas , then we 're going to have to come back and discuss it with the committee . But let 's go in and learn it first of all , rather than assume it necessarily . 
Query : Summarize the discussion about the impact on children . Llyr Gruffydd AM : Okay . So , moving on , then , to the impact on the child and this whole question around school readiness , of course , which is an important one to address . Clearly , one of the main outcomes of this policy will be the academic performance of children , hopefully , later on in life . I want to come back to this point that the Children 's Commissioner for Wales and others have raised : the concern that , actually , the most disadvantaged—those from workless households—are being excluded from this policy . Is n't there therefore a risk that they 'll be left even further behind ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : I 've had long , detailed and positive discussions with the children 's commissioner on this , and I know the children 's commissioner would want a more universal offer , but I make two points on that : one is , that was not what the commitment in the manifesto was , and it 's not the offer that 's being taken forward now . It is a different thing , a universal offer , and there are issues around that with complexity , and also affordability . But it is n't the offer that we took forward into Government ; this is what we 're taking forward . But it is interesting in terms of that aspect of families then who lose out . I 'd say two significant things on it : one is , this does n't stand alone purely as 30 hours of childcare . Within this , there are 10 hours of the foundation years , educational input , which is there for everybody . But before that , particularly for those disadvantaged families , before we even get to that stage , you have schemes such as Flying Start , and I know this committee has looked in detail at Flying Start and has said that it would like to see it rolled out everywhere . If I had all the money under the sun , I would really do that , Chair ; I would really do it . But I do n't have all the money under the sun . Llyr Gruffydd AM : But you do have the ability to target the money . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , but the fact that Flying Start , we know , is leading to those outcomes where those children , in quite challenged circumstances very often , are more ready to step up to the foundation year , are more ready , then , to step through into mainstream education in later years—those things tie together . So , there are the 10 hours of education provision that sits here for every family , by the way , within this offer , let alone the childcare . That does n't mean that everybody 's excluded , but it does mean , yes , that this offer is focused on working parents . And we do n't think that that 's a bad thing . In fact , it does overlap with other offers that other political parties were taking forward into the last election , which was focusing on how we support the biggest thing that we often have in our constituency mailbags , which is , ' I ca n't afford to go back to work because I ca n't afford the childcare . Do n't tell me to go back to work , I ca n't afford it . ' Llyr Gruffydd AM : The majority of disadvantaged children do n't live in Flying Start areas , do they ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , indeed . Llyr Gruffydd AM : So , there 's a missing cohort there that ca n't access one or the other , and the school readiness gap is growing , and , really , are we focusing our resources in the right place here ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Well , yes , in terms of this scheme , but it does n't sit alone as this scheme—it 's the wider plethora of , I have to say , progressive and advanced initiatives that we have in Wales that take different forms . It 's not only Flying Start that provides that other support for parents , and readiness not only for the parents and for their children , but also the support into work . So , if , for example , you look at the Parents , Childcare and Employment programme , which is separate from this , there is support there for every parent in terms of helping them get supported into work from disadvantaged families . If you look at the support for the children , we 've got the 10 hours that sits within the sphere of the education , but we 've also got all the other family intervention programmes that help with socialisation , education and so on and so forth . If you look at this solely on its own and say , 'Well , there is nothing else there ; the rest of Wales is a desert and there 's no support for parents , for getting parents back into work or for those parents who are not seeking to go back into work but also need the support and for their children in education ' , I 'd be worried . But , actually , this fits as part of the jigsaw that we have in Wales , where I think we are well ahead of the other nations . Yes , we could do more , and I always say , Llyr ; I always say , Chair , that if I had—I do n't have a chequebook at all , because it 's not in my gift—if I had a blank cheque I 'd do a lot more , but we do n't . But what we can do is get the right schemes in place , and if this helps drive more choices for working parents , including , by the way— . There are niceties within this as well ; it does n't have to be that both parents are working . You could have a parent who is on incapacity benefit . You could have a parent who is a registered carer . They would qualify for the scheme . Those will be some of those most disadvantaged families that we both have those concerns about . So , there is some flexibility within this scheme as well to deal with some of those disadvantaged families . Lynne Neagle AM : Darren on this . Darren Millar AM : I am surprised by the answer there , particularly given that one of the ambitions of the Government is to close this attainment gap later in life when schoolchildren get to their examinations , when they 're 16 years old . Yet this appears to be driving a bigger wedge in terms of development , which could , of course , lead to a perverse outcome later on in life , but I do n't want to ask you about that . If I can just very quickly ask you : has consideration been given to making free childcare available to parents where they 're in 16 hours or more of education each week ? So , they may not be entering the labour market , but , of course , one of those barriers to them getting back into the labour market could well be their education , so what arrangements are in place there ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Darren , we have considered it , and we have n't included it within the scheme because this is designed to enable parents to go into work , not into training to enable them to get into work . There are other forms of support available for parents in terms of college and so on and so forth , but it 's not this scheme . Darren Millar AM : But it 's not prescribed support , is it ? You know , it 's not universally available to people who might be wanting to get back into the labour market over that barrier . You must have done some costings , then , if you 've considered it , and you must have tried to identify numbers . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : I 'm looking to my left and my right . Owain Lloyd : Not at this point . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We haven't— Darren Millar AM : So , you have n't considered it that much , have you ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : We have actually considered— . We consider it from the point of , 'What is this scheme set up to do ? ' It 's very clear . When we ran , in the manifesto on this point— Darren Millar AM : I understand that . I do n't want you to repeat yourself because I know we are against the clock . But , very specifically , when you say you 've considered it , what you mean is you thought about it but you 've not costed it , you 've not identified the numbers that might be involved— Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Absolutely , absolutely . Darren Millar AM : And therefore you 've not considered whether it might be affordable in addition to the policy objective that this is trying to meet . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : No , Darren , you 're right : we have n't considered affordability because we 've considered it on first principles to do with what this offer is trying to do . It does n't fit within the offer so , as such , why would we do the costings ? Darren Millar AM : Perhaps I can frame my question in another way . Are you prepared to consider it if you 're able to identify the numbers and potential cost ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Ah , right , okay . We 'd be interested in your thoughts as a committee , but it does n't actually fit within the first principles of what the scheme is designed to do . Darren , can I just pick up on your point , in case you misinterpreted what I was saying to Llyr ? I drew attention in my answer to Llyr to schemes such as the PaCE scheme . In Gwynedd , one of our pilot areas , they are combining the Team Around the Family with this childcare offer . So , what they are doing is wrapping the support around . It is not the case , as you 've suggested then , that there is somehow more disadvantage being heaped on other families . What this does is tie in in those pilot areas with the existing provision , and that's the way we want to see it work . So , I would n't want you to be under any misapprehension that this makes conditions worse for families . Those families who have a registered carer in them where one parent works , and those families who have somebody on incapacity benefit will qualify for the scheme . All families will qualify for the 10 hours of education . In Gwynedd , they 're wrapping the Team Around the Family with this offer— Darren Millar AM : But on the other hand , Minister , you 've also suggested that this will accelerate child development for those kids who are able to access it , and yet not all kids will be able to access it , particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : But all children can access the 10 hours , and they can access Flying Start— Darren Millar AM : But 10 hours is very different to 30 hours , is it not ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , but they can access Flying Start or they can access the Team Around the Family— Darren Millar AM : If they 're in a Flying Start area . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : —or they can be in a children 's zone area or they can— Darren Millar AM : If they 're in those areas . Lynne Neagle AM : Right , I 've got John and then David , and the questions and answers are going to have to be brief , please . John Griffiths AM : Yes , certainly , Chair . In terms of child development and how this fits with wider Welsh Government strategy , Huw , I 'd be interested in what you 'd have to say about the quality of childcare . We 're talking a lot about quantity , but obviously we want to up quality , and that 's recognised by Welsh Government . They 've talked about increasing the qualifications within the workforce , and the quality . I just wonder how that sits within the £4.50 , because there could be pressures in the opposite direction there , and some tension between wanting to up the qualifications and quality of workforce whilst keeping affordability in place . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : John , you 're absolutely right , and two things on that : I visited one of the facilities in the Valleys the other day that was taking this forward—a very good independent sector-run childcare provision , with Welsh language and English language running alongside each other , and I asked the point about the integration , curiously , but what they were doing was— . Their standard of staff was an exemplar of what we 'd want to see : not only very well-qualified childcare staff who were qualified within not simply the child-minding but the wider child development aspects— . So , it was hard to differentiate , in some ways , what was happening there from what would be happening in a child development educational surrounding , and including the nutritional stuff and all of that . Now , that is the model we need to see , and the £4.50 seems to work , at the moment , for that . It 'll be interesting , as we discussed previously , as it goes forward— . We need to look at whether that works , going forward . But the quality , I think , is key , and that 's why we 're focused very much on registered inspected providers , as opposed to every Tom , Dick and Harriet . John Griffiths AM : If we want to increase salary levels , though , which I think is a necessary part of this picture of improving quality , then obviously that might impact on the £4.50 rate . Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , indeed , and we are cognisant— . It 's interesting that we focus on whether the £4.50 is affordable , but the £4.50—you know , we 're having an interesting discussion internally about how that £4.50 offer per hour sits alongside others , such as the foundation phase offer , and it 's more generous . So , I think it 's : how do we align , as time goes by , the child development aspects of the whole early years stuff ? Now , we 're doing some fascinating work that I think I 've referred to on this committee before about aligning the early years development entirely . Now , this is an evolving piece of work , but I think the childcare offer should ultimately fit within that . How do you make sure that every offer that is Government-funded works on child development ? It 's not simply childcare . 
Query : What did Huw Irranca-Davies think about the Flying Start scheme when talking about the impact on children ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , but the fact that Flying Start , we know , is leading to those outcomes where those children , in quite challenged circumstances very often , are more ready to step up to the foundation year , are more ready , then , to step through into mainstream education in later years—those things tie together . So , there are the 10 hours of education provision that sits here for every family , by the way , within this offer , let alone the childcare . That does n't mean that everybody 's excluded , but it does mean , yes , that this offer is focused on working parents . And we do n't think that that 's a bad thing . In fact , it does overlap with other offers that other political parties were taking forward into the last election , which was focusing on how we support the biggest thing that we often have in our constituency mailbags , which is , ' I ca n't afford to go back to work because I ca n't afford the childcare . Do n't tell me to go back to work , I ca n't afford it . ' Llyr Gruffydd AM : The majority of disadvantaged children do n't live in Flying Start areas , do they ? Huw Irranca-Davies AM : Yes , indeed . 
Query : How did Huw Irranca-Davies ensure the high qualification and quality of the workforce while the rates remained at £4.50 ? John Griffiths AM : Yes , certainly , Chair .

Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Project Manager : Uh fourth meeting . { vocalsound } User Interface : We have to do what ? Project Manager : Some extra deciding . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } W what ? Alri alright . We 'll see . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well { disfmarker } User Interface : Oh . Project Manager : { gap } I 'll show you the notes again . Very interesting . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well you 'll you two will uh present us your prototype . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Then um { disfmarker } I guess that 's your bit ? I I did n't s see anything about it , Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : so { vocalsound } I already uh thought you uh you were { gap } to do that . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So the you 're uh { gap } . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : I 'll show you how we 're going to do with financing this uh design . User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , that 's important too . Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : And then we 'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it . User Interface : { vocalsound } Bit late . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Because uh well we 'll see about the costs . Um we 'll uh evaluate our p our uh production and then uh we can close . Industrial Designer : Alright . Project Manager : Well the finance uh we 'll do later , so um firstly uh { vocalsound } I 'll show you the notes . { vocalsound } I do n't think it 's very interesting . { vocalsound } User Interface : I think it is . Project Manager : Oh nei . Uh no . { vocalsound } Alright . This is copy paste . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : From me of course , yeah . Project Manager : Of course . You had some very strange layout . Industrial Designer : Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . { vocalsound } It 's a nice chorus , yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well um { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : We ge we went through the agenda , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I do n't think it 's very interesting and go through it again . Industrial Designer : Repeat it yeah . Alright . Project Manager : So uh { disfmarker } This is what we decided . It 's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : And then uh we can we can uh use the time better . Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us . Industrial Designer : Alright , we both uh will ? Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Or one of us will ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Alright . Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } User Interface : No you go and I 'll uh supplement you . Industrial Designer : Alright . If I make mistakes uh you 'll uh { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : Correct . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Right . Uh well this is our design . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh it 's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we 'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there 's this part um { vocalsound } which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we 're we 're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : and later we 'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . { vocalsound } Um then we have uh the lower part { vocalsound } of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it 's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . User Interface : Yeah , it 's a double R_ , but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah ? User Interface : It 's a double R_ . Industrial Designer : It 's a double R_ . Yeah the logo { disfmarker } User Interface : But { vocalsound } it 's very difficult to to draw that in { disfmarker } Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , alright . Industrial Designer : Uh uh it 's difficult to draw so small , but it 's our double R_ uh logo is in there . Project Manager : Okay . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Um so that 's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it 's difficult to draw again the little oval or round { disfmarker } I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . User Interface : Oval yeah . Project Manager : Alright . Industrial Designer : So { gap } uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m User Interface : Channel up and volume ? Industrial Designer : Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh { vocalsound } uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button 's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : And then we 've here the Menu button and the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Alright . User Interface : Menu for the L_C_D_ screen . Industrial Designer : And the video button . The { disfmarker } Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Marketing : Mm right . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen . Project Manager : 'Kay . Industrial Designer : Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want . Project Manager : Well if I look at it , the side the side view { disfmarker } User Interface : Well , at the back { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : and then you can add suggestions . Project Manager : Oh yeah alright . Yeah { gap } . Industrial Designer : Maybe I I do n't want to { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I do n't want to suppress you but n I 'll uh finish this uh quick . Project Manager : { gap } Industrial Designer : Um okay I 've had everything I guess on the front ? User Interface : No the back . With the logo and our uh l uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah the back . Yeah . { vocalsound } We thought about { disfmarker } Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . { vocalsound } And we thought about the logo big in the middle . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Maybe that 's too much Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : but you have to say uh say that if you think that way . User Interface : No I do n't think { disfmarker } And the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : That 's basically what we were thinking about , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . Industrial Designer : and { disfmarker } Project Manager : W User Interface : And about the side view um { disfmarker } This the front wo n't be as thick , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well I see , but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course , Project Manager : Well . Yeah I see it . Industrial Designer : the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it 's terrible . User Interface : Well , it wo n't be visible . Mm ? Project Manager : If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Why ? { vocalsound } Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : mean uh the the the the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . Marketing : Yeah , I agree . User Interface : { gap } If y { vocalsound } If you handle a remote , you you usually do n't have your hand straight like this . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } In the middle in the { disfmarker } User Interface : You you have it a bit uh { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : It depends on the size . If it 's kinda small , this is is great . But if it 's it 's larger , then you want to grab it . Project Manager : And how large is it ? User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , that 's the question . Industrial Designer : That 's the question . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh well { disfmarker } Yeah . H What do you suggest I mean we do ? { gap } This was Mike 's prototype , Project Manager : Well uh { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : and y you seemed to agreed on it . Project Manager : Well the sides I have n't seen yet , uh { gap } ? Industrial Designer : But now you have a totally different { gap } . User Interface : Well , they lay there all the time . Industrial Designer : The size ? Yeah well the size does n't really matter w I mean { disfmarker } Project Manager : They the the the the the side view , Industrial Designer : Side ? Uh oh the side ? Project Manager : we did n't uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : W we we he drew the s the side , User Interface : Yeah yeah . Industrial Designer : but you d you were n't paying attention as usual . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well any case , we 'll discuss it now . Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea { gap } . Marketing : Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : But you you hold it like this . User Interface : Yeah you you do n't you do n't grab it , Industrial Designer : You 're not holding it like this or something . User Interface : you you { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well y y y you do n't have it like this . Project Manager : No no no . Industrial Designer : You have it more like this . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { gap } You you you 're using buttons this way , or if you 're right-handed , this way . Marketing : Like you 're holding your telephone . Project Manager : Yep . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So you { disfmarker } Yeah . So { disfmarker } Marketing : Because if you have a screen on it , you wan na look at your screen . User Interface : Hmm . That way , it it falls into your hand . I think . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah well { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , Marketing : Yeah , I agree on this . Industrial Designer : so { disfmarker } Well { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : No , I do n't think so . That 's not uh the point { disfmarker } User Interface : No but but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Well the the { disfmarker } Well that 's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree Project Manager : Yeah well User Interface : and only Nils { disfmarker } Project Manager : uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that 's it . User Interface : But you 're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes . So uh I c I c Industrial Designer : If necessary . Project Manager : Well , we 'll we we 'll do it like this . Industrial Designer : But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Alright , if you think that that 's the way it should { gap } { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah ? Industrial Designer : Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable . Project Manager : No { disfmarker } No , Industrial Designer : But do you Project Manager : when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick { disfmarker } But { disfmarker } In the market uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : But d you do n't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think . Project Manager : No not totally . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Not totally , well { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } For me , I I would n't buy it . Let 's say it like that . Industrial Designer : Yeah but of course y you are also human . We have to take uh { vocalsound } every everyone into account . So { disfmarker } Project Manager : No { gap } { disfmarker } Marketing : And you might be uh { disfmarker } You might be target customer . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yes but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Well uh who who else thinks like you ? User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : We do n't know . Project Manager : Yeah , we do n't know , Industrial Designer : Maybe a thousand people , Project Manager : but that 's uh that 's that 's that 's more market research . Industrial Designer : or a million people . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So { vocalsound } let it be like this at uh at this moment . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Let it be . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay ? Industrial Designer : Alright . So that 's that . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh any other suggestions ? Project Manager : No , I think it 's great . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : But what about the redesigning ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Comes to that later . User Interface : Okay . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Um you . Uh c You can uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Walter . { vocalsound } You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } You 're very personal again . Marketing : { vocalsound } Alright . Great . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : That 's more useful than just { vocalsound } speaking . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Well , this is just a short intro . Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : I 'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . That 's gon na be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : So I made a { disfmarker } I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . Well , I put some questions in a Word file . See if I can find them . Uh uh uh uh mm . Project Manager : 'Kay . Marketing : Well { disfmarker } User Interface : Hmm . Marketing : I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I do n't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . Seventy five percent of them . So what do we think ? Industrial Designer : Well d we designed it , so of course we are very { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : Yeah , we 're we 're not quite uh objective about this . Marketing : Yeah { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : Well we designed it to be good-looking . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : No , I know , but { vocalsound } I have to uh evaluate it . So I have to take this questionnaire . Project Manager : To the customers ? Industrial Designer : So and we ha we have answer now ? Project Manager : To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . { gap } Marketing : Yeah { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Yeah , but I ca n't can s Project Manager : Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know . User Interface : Hmm . Project Manager : But um { disfmarker } Well { vocalsound } we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . Uh do we find it good-looking ? Well we think so . Uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I { disfmarker } Yeah , I think it { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , but uh , you know { disfmarker } We dis we di { vocalsound } we designed it to be perfect . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : So { vocalsound } { disfmarker } But we have to be critic critical about it . And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . So we { vocalsound } we know where we stand . Project Manager : Well , one . Industrial Designer : { gap } Marketing : 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten . Project Manager : Well so it 's point four . Easy to find t Industrial Designer : Well l well let 's start with the beginning , just one by one . { vocalsound } Marketing : Right , so { disfmarker } Right . Uh is it good-looking ? Industrial Designer : Well , I guess uh I think uh { vocalsound } it 's uh it 's it 's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . { gap } Project Manager : Two . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : That was our target audience of course . But it 's also not completely um { vocalsound } uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . Uh it 's it 's not f a device that { disfmarker } Marketing : The titanium might be uh f for older people . Industrial Designer : Yeah , that 's that 's uh for older people , it 's it 's more that classical look . So { disfmarker } Marketing : It you put uh put a black front on it or something . User Interface : Hmm . Industrial Designer : Uh no . { vocalsound } I think { disfmarker } Yeah they like black of course , but I think they 'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also { disfmarker } Uh I think it 's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . So I think it 's very good-looking Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : and not only for youth uh young people . User Interface : I think we should n't discuss any points points that long , because I do n't know how how many points there are but uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : No . I totally agree . Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : Yeah , the fourteen yeah . Project Manager : We we have to get get on , go through this . Marketing : Right , a number please . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Is it easy to t change channels ? Yeah well I think so . Marketing : So the last one is seven . User Interface : Um , no it 's uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Easy to change channels ? Project Manager : No , not false . It 's one . Marketing : Oh , sorry . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , right . Project Manager : Well uh two ? Y Well we have to go through it { gap } . Marketing : Change channels ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I think it 's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : So I { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Yeah . You { disfmarker } How can you make it any easier ? { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } With two huge buttons . Marketing : The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : Yeah , huge is a { disfmarker } Yeah . Project Manager : Two . Marketing : Two ? Alright . The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ? Project Manager : Well , no . We did n't implement anything about that . { gap } Industrial Designer : D we d we do n't we do n't have uh that s User Interface : Well it 's easier to find than a a normal black one or something , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well six then . { vocalsound } User Interface : because of the colour . But { disfmarker } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Six ? Right . Industrial Designer : Well we do n't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so , Project Manager : Are the functions easy to learn ? Industrial Designer : but um um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an { disfmarker } User Interface : { gap } We have so few functions , so { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , I agree . Project Manager : And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ? User Interface : Well , I should { disfmarker } I think two , Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : because { vocalsound } the voice recorder is n not self learning . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Ah . Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager : { gap } Marketing : Alright . Two ? Industrial Designer : Mm ? Project Manager : Yeah , but just do some { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { gap } We we { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } I th I th I think this is too time consuming . Industrial Designer : Are we take too much time ? Project Manager : Uh not not towards you , Marketing : Yeah , I agree . Project Manager : but towards this all . Marketing : No . Project Manager : Th this is { gap } { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : We you have to put it to the customers . Marketing : Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? { vocalsound } R_S_I_ sensitive ? Project Manager : Uh well well a bit , so four . Marketing : Four . Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah , very much . One . Project Manager : One . And features included also one . And { disfmarker } { vocalsound } One . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . Uh we still think so . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Device fancy feeling . Industrial Designer : And I think fancy-feeling too , Project Manager : Yeah , cool man . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : because of the titanium back . Yeah . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Are there enough technology ? Yeah well also we have two . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , that 's great . Project Manager : Is the device easy to use ? User Interface : The { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes we have { vocalsound } not many buttons . Industrial Designer : So well maybe two Project Manager : Two , three . User Interface : Two { vocalsound } two . Industrial Designer : because of the voice recorder . Marketing : Well , with the uh { disfmarker } Three . Project Manager : Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? User Interface : T Industrial Designer : F Project Manager : Well in our covers , in our fronts . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : So yes , one . Industrial Designer : Yeah . One or two . Yeah . User Interface : One or two , another two . Marketing : Nah f four I think . Industrial Designer : Four ? Marketing : { vocalsound } If you look at this { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well , it does n't really resemble any fruit , uh that 's true . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course . Marketing : No . Project Manager : Oh okay . Okay { gap } . User Interface : Well three . Marketing : Three , alright . Industrial Designer : And you can also have { gap } front with uh with fruit on it . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , that 's true . Project Manager : Is the material attractive ? Marketing : But { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : Mm . Yeah . Project Manager : Well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . So I would say at least two . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well { disfmarker } Yeah . User Interface : This is the last meeting ? Project Manager : Yes , but we we have to design much more , User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : The average will uh come later . Project Manager : because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . { vocalsound } Um { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly . Project Manager : Oh . Uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : There had to be some kind of trouble along the way . User Interface : Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point . Industrial Designer : My god . Project Manager : I had to fit it in . Marketing : It has to go to twelve , right ? Project Manager : I twelve and a half . Marketing : Twelve and a half . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Well what costs a lot ? The sample spea costs four . Industrial Designer : The what ? Project Manager : The sample speaker , Industrial Designer : The { disfmarker } Marketing : Out . Project Manager : the s sensor . Marketing : That 's easy . Kick it out . Project Manager : Kick it out . User Interface : The what ? Project Manager : We have to go to twelve and a half . Marketing : Yeah . The speaker . Project Manager : The speaker costs far , by far the most . User Interface : Oh . Industrial Designer : Yeah w tha that 's uh that 's a bit an optional option . Marketing : That 's some wrong info , man . { vocalsound } Project Manager : It it is n't worth it . Industrial Designer : No . No , d th No . Marketing : No . Project Manager : We could make two different versions , one with and one without . Marketing : It 's uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : But for this { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : It 's just extra . Kick it out . Project Manager : So , zero . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Then we go to fourteen point six . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Well the titanium I do n't want to lose actually . Marketing : What more ? Industrial Designer : No . Marketing : { vocalsound } Batteries are uh quite { disfmarker } Project Manager : L_C_ three ? Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on , Marketing : { vocalsound } Uh no , no no no . Project Manager : w a remote control has a battery . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : N Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think . User Interface : Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ? Industrial Designer : Because uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said . Industrial Designer : { gap } the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah ? Marketing : Hmm . User Interface : Ca n't we do that with a regular chip ? Industrial Designer : No . User Interface : Why not ? Industrial Designer : Because uh that uh y { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well what what 's the difference between simple and regular ? Industrial Designer : because my information says it . Project Manager : What 's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ? Industrial Designer : Huh ? User Interface : Yeah . Regular is normal . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : And simple ? Industrial Designer : Uh well yeah I I read something about it , but { disfmarker } User Interface : Simple . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Nothing . User Interface : { vocalsound } Elementary . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well { gap } ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , Project Manager : Your part . Industrial Designer : I I read something about it , but it was n't very clear . I d I did n't in include it in my report . Project Manager : What happens if we do { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Single { disfmarker } Well you have to use a chip . So { disfmarker } Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen . Project Manager : How much do we win ? One . User Interface : We we we { disfmarker } Why ? Project Manager : { gap } User Interface : We have very little options furthermore , for the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : But if you have a regular chip , you ca n't have the L_C_D_ screen . User Interface : Uh well we have to put that in . Marketing : Yeah , we need to have the { vocalsound } the L_C_D_ screen . Industrial Designer : That that 's a fact . Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well , we could say , well this special colour , that is n't that that is n't there , Marketing : No { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour . Industrial Designer : Yeah , but it 's only one half . Marketing : Yeah , but { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : Nah . Industrial Designer : Uh it d it does n't { disfmarker } Marketing : No , that 's n It 's not relevant . Project Manager : Yeah , User Interface : Yeah , you must change the chip uh back . Project Manager : then you s then you only have one half left . User Interface : You must change the chip back , Nils . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Uh yeah . Industrial Designer : But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen . Marketing : No , { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Then the whole concept is uh Industrial Designer : Yeah , I know but that 's what my information says . I di I did n't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . { vocalsound } User Interface : Hmm . { vocalsound } No { vocalsound } we oh { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : You { disfmarker } You can make you can make it cheaper . Industrial Designer : You have to use it . Marketing : But if you do n't sell Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : You you we have an advanced chip-on-print , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : and we have an L_C_ display . I think that 's a bit double . Project Manager : Yeah ? No , { vocalsound } User Interface : Y we do n't need both . Project Manager : the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display . Industrial Designer : For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah . User Interface : Says { gap } . Project Manager : Says , his { disfmarker } Uh that was in the second meeting , I think . Industrial Designer : Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? Because we you have uncurved { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well I I did single curve to { disfmarker } Well you said s double curved , User Interface : I ? Project Manager : uh he , User Interface : { gap } ? Project Manager : because uh I thought it 's a b a bit cheaper already . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : We can also make it flat . Industrial Designer : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : { gap } No Industrial Designer : But what what did what do n Marketing : no no no . Project Manager : But { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Sorry , but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } What do they mean with the curves ? Project Manager : Curved ? Industrial Designer : Is th Is this a curve ? Project Manager : Yes , that 's curved . Industrial Designer : One curve ? Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah . Project Manager : No , it 's one curve . Industrial Designer : It 's how you { disfmarker } It 's how you look at it . User Interface : { vocalsound } One curve . { vocalsound } Project Manager : One curve , simple . Industrial Designer : Well then we have a huge problem I think . Marketing : { gap } Industrial Designer : W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half . Project Manager : We have a big financial problem . User Interface : Well we make it more expensive to buy . Project Manager : Well , then we have two dollars less profit . Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they wo n't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } { gap } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . But { disfmarker } Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing people might buy . Industrial Designer : But uh I { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah or we could replace it { disfmarker } Marketing : If you if you make it cool to have { disfmarker } Project Manager : By the way , we also have this one . Marketing : Oh , that 's just great . Project Manager : Oh , costs nothing . That 's nice . { vocalsound } Marketing : Oh , alright . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Hey but uh I think you 'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it 's it 's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . Project Manager : Plastic is { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Yes , but I just got it . Marketing : { gap } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Well that 's pretty uh l User Interface : Why why do n't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , Marketing : That is pretty stupid . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : N not very practical . { vocalsound } Well { disfmarker } User Interface : uh titanium-coloured plastic ? Project Manager : Who ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : You want to dump the titanium ? User Interface : Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper . Project Manager : And make all plastic , then we ha then we 're there . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } But I 'm n I do n't agree . User Interface : But then we we 've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again . Industrial Designer : I think { disfmarker } Project Manager : Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy . User Interface : Ah no no . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : It 's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same . Project Manager : No , I do n't think so . User Interface : Well , I do think so . Industrial Designer : I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the { disfmarker } Marketing : Y Project Manager : Yes . And the feel , User Interface : { gap } feel . Project Manager : and th that it is strong , and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i Marketing : Yeah , I agree . Industrial Designer : Alright it 's not our target audience , but it 's it 's useful if it 's uh important for old people . Project Manager : We still { vocalsound } we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : but not lose the one { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I think the titanium is very important . User Interface : Yeah alright but then we we wo n't get there . Industrial Designer : Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then . User Interface : We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think . Marketing : I do n't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen . Industrial Designer : Well what else ? User Interface : No , nothing . Industrial Designer : W I mean uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Or you shou { vocalsound } It 's { disfmarker } User Interface : Amen . Marketing : Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Because you have lots of functions { vocalsound } in it too . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , well yeah . Alright . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Why ca n't I { disfmarker } User Interface : But { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I agree with that . So we u we use uh { disfmarker } Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic . Project Manager : I 'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that 's trendy d these days . Marketing : Yeah , I agree . Industrial Designer : So titanium-coloured plastic for the back . Project Manager : I I 'll talk to the managers . { vocalsound } User Interface : No no no no . W Titanium stays there . Project Manager : Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah this is good , Marketing : Osl { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : but it it 's not good enough . { vocalsound } So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I 'm afraid . Project Manager : Ah those { gap } those account managers , what do th d what do they know ? User Interface : Well { disfmarker } Project Manager : Come on . Riot . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : What do we { disfmarker } Well what do we know ? All we want is a is a fancy design but we do n't really consider the costs . So { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes , yes . User Interface : No because we did not know anything about it . Project Manager : One and a half Euros . Hmm ? Industrial Designer : Yeah al alright , yeah . Marketing : If you do n't have the money , you ca n't make it . Industrial Designer : But we have to deal with it now . So { disfmarker } Marketing : So s If you do n't have the money , you ca n't make it . So this is too expensive . Project Manager : So ? Industrial Designer : So { disfmarker } Marketing : So we have to make it cheaper . Industrial Designer : Titanium gone and add plastic . User Interface : Yeah , but then we 've got money left . Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ? Project Manager : Well , no it 's just uh all plastic . Industrial Designer : No { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well alright . Huh . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } No yeah well { disfmarker } Project Manager : { gap } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Oh six . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } It 's just free , man . Industrial Designer : A lot of plastic , yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Four . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : No two for the to make it clear . Project Manager : But then we can add the special colour ? As we have money over uh left . { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : And we still have money left . User Interface : Yeah . W Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : What do we want , guys ? Industrial Designer : I want gold plating . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No no um { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah right . I want chrome . { vocalsound } User Interface : Well I think uh the case is double curved then . Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : Because you y have that curve Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } We have we have to uh fill { disfmarker } User Interface : and you have that curve . Project Manager : Y Oh no . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Well , th that that is the problem . User Interface : Yeah well uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : W we ha { vocalsound } Project Manager : Alright . Industrial Designer : No no no , but th that 's not f um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Safe . User Interface : Well y we have curves in all directions . Industrial Designer : Well you can you can double curve , if you do n't have titanium . And that we dropped , Project Manager : So { disfmarker } alright . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : so it it can be done . { vocalsound } But it 's pretty funny . We we do want to reach twelve point five . But it is n't bad to to to stay at eleven . Project Manager : Finance ? User Interface : I mean , this this ai n't titanium , but it looks like it . Project Manager : Well , guys ? Industrial Designer : We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : Guys ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : We have to dump our titanium , Marketing : Shoot . Project Manager : and we 'll hate the managers for that , but now we 're going to evaluate our project , of uh project , User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Objection . User Interface : Pro project . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } project . { vocalsound } Well , { vocalsound } satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ? Industrial Designer : Well I ca n't get no satisfaction , but uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I think it 's uh { disfmarker } Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : I think it 's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , me too . Project Manager : That 's really bad . But that that that 's that , yeah that 's a reason , Industrial Designer : Its it 's uh ridiculous actually , but { disfmarker } User Interface : And uh unrealistic . Project Manager : but also for our creativity . We had um nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity . User Interface : Well we we we used our creativity , Marketing : Right . User Interface : but we just had to adapt it to the costs . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Which is n't very practical , Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Nei . Uh no . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : but { vocalsound } that 's the way . Project Manager : Well , alright . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh leadership next . User Interface : { vocalsound } Terrible . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh teamwork ? { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Leadership . User Interface : Leadership ? Well { disfmarker } Marketing : Well it 's { vocalsound } { disfmarker } It was very democratic . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh yeah well { vocalsound } I think so also . User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager : I al I I 've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : But o alright , the teamwork ? Industrial Designer : Well uh they they did n't think of the requirements . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : It 's the requirements of the user , uh I guess . Project Manager : No they said , oh we wo n't d uh we wo n't uh use teletext , uh we wo n't use the D_V_D_ . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Alright , teamwork ? Well great I think . Marketing : Well { disfmarker } User Interface : Right yeah . { gap } Marketing : Yeah , think so too . Project Manager : Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } It was a complete disaster . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , I do n't like it . Yeah ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } No { disfmarker } Uh it it it uh it is uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } User Interface : No , that 's a SMARTboard , and that 's a digital pen . Project Manager : It 's also a It 's both the SMARTboards . User Interface : Or not ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No it 's other way around . That 's the SMARTboard . Project Manager : I liked this SMARTboard , Industrial Designer : That 's the digital panel . Project Manager : but I hated that one . Marketing : This this this is n't a SMARTboard , right ? Project Manager : Well it 's both a SMARTboard . Industrial Designer : That 's that 's the smart Marketing : Yeah right . B but you { disfmarker } User Interface : Oh they 're both SMARTboards . { vocalsound } Marketing : This is just a large t large television . Project Manager : No . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } A televi Yeah . Marketing : You u you use the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : It 's both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw . Marketing : Yeah , but you ca This is just a beamer function . And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . But { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well , wi w which one did you like ? User Interface : { gap } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Left or right ? { vocalsound } Marketing : That one . Project Manager : { vocalsound } That one . { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } That one is n't accurate . { vocalsound } It just does n't work . Project Manager : Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : But I I think this is meant by the digital pen . Marketing : You can { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes . Th that is so . Industrial Designer : Well I did n't use uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , but I think there 's a big distinction between the { vocalsound } these th Project Manager : We 're now talking about the SMARTboards . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : I do n't need a SMARTboard . User Interface : { gap } Well we we used that one , Industrial Designer : Nei It it 's much m { vocalsound } User Interface : and we needed it . I think . Marketing : Yeah , but { vocalsound } give me a beamer . That 's uh that 's much uh much cheaper . User Interface : Yeah alright , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an { disfmarker } I I like it . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Okay , alright . User Interface : Yeah I like that one , but that one is terrible . Industrial Designer : But uh you can uh { disfmarker } I I sent it about three times now . Uh { vocalsound } a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing . Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah , it is . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : The simple uh sch school board . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Marketing : I agree . Project Manager : And uh the digi the digital pen ? Did uh did you like that one ? Industrial Designer : I I did n't use it . Marketing : No . Industrial Designer : I wrote things down but I did n't import it into my laptop . Project Manager : I used it uh just to check it out , but uh { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } That 's the { gap } { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : You you ca n't send that to anyone , because you you 've scrabbled something on a page for yourself , User Interface : { gap } Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } It is n't practical . Right . Project Manager : and then you 're going to send it , yeah . Well , no . Industrial Designer : W { vocalsound } But also y you write things down . And i you can also bring your your your note block . Marketing : Your notepad . Yeah . Industrial Designer : So what 's the what 's the th what 's the point of importing it into { disfmarker } Project Manager : It 's , no , it it 's useless . User Interface : Well I I drew this . { gap } Mm . And I made a mistake . But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah alright . For drawings , Project Manager : For drawings , yes . User Interface : Yeah for drawings . Industrial Designer : but not for personal notes . I think that 's not very { disfmarker } User Interface : { gap } N notes mm . Industrial Designer : Uh I mean { vocalsound } you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper { disfmarker } Project Manager : But { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , it might be useful for drawings . I I agree on that . User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : If you 've { disfmarker } If you 've { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : But for notes , it i you you have to put that in a strict { disfmarker } Uh you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . And notes uh for a meeting are very strict . So if you uh were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So it does n't d does n't have any { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , right . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah I understand . Marketing : That Stefan use . Industrial Designer : But I think uh d this option is only useful if you 've got a lot of paperwork . { vocalsound } You ca n't { disfmarker } It 's not very uh ni Yeah well a lot of documents are { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : No , I do n't think so . It 's it 's only useful if you have to draw something . User Interface : Yeah . But then uh it 's really useful , I think . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yep . Alright . Um etcetera ? Well uh the laptops ? Industrial Designer : Mu Yeah right . Project Manager : Of course great . Marketing : Yeah , great .

Industrial Designer : Well did you really uh { disfmarker } Did you really take uh take those in account ? { vocalsound } I { vocalsound } half of time I did n't notice they were there . So { disfmarker } Project Manager : No . No . I have n't looked w one time directly at the camera . { vocalsound } I do n't care about it . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } But we should n't talk about that . User Interface : Well I did . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Because { vocalsound } this is a realistic environment . Project Manager : Well w why not ? Uh etcetera { gap } { disfmarker } We { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : { vocalsound } N new ideas found ? Industrial Designer : Right . Okay . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : What kind of ideas for n a future schedule { vocalsound } { disfmarker } What ? { vocalsound } For future um meetings { vocalsound } you have got ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Well I missed uh the option to uh to email , Marketing : Communicate in between . User Interface : yeah .

So { disfmarker } User Interface : No it is n't . Project Manager : Yeah , for drawings . Industrial Designer : Well , for drawing for drawings . Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . So it is n't useless . Project Manager : But uh two t But uh th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if I had a company and I 'm going to uh buy those expensive huge expensive uh things , I and I have to w pay those uh papers uh that are expensive , I 'm not going to uh { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well { disfmarker } No { disfmarker } Marketing : For people who uh sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it 's useful . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well th then still they they they should have a a nice graphics programme on the laptop . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : But it 's still an expensive uh expensive { disfmarker } Project Manager : Because this is huge Marketing : Well { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : uh this v very very uh expensive paper . User Interface : Well you you ca n't you ca n't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand . Marketing : Yeah , I agree . User Interface : With the mouse it is { disfmarker } No . { gap } Industrial Designer : But if w Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Well and if { disfmarker } Marketing : Mouse is ju just is n't working if you 're sketching . User Interface : Uh indeed . Industrial Designer : And but what if uh maybe this this board uh SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . But suppose it was working correctly , what uh would it be useful then , if it was n't off all the time ? { vocalsound } A Project Manager : Well no . I hated to draw like that . You you ca n't draw anything uh neat . Industrial Designer : Really ? Marketing : Yeah , but he 's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , { vocalsound } yeah , very precise { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Anything you want . Any b b Yeah . L li li Project Manager : I if it if it would be perfect following . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well th th then still it 's it 's it 's very expensive uh towards a a just a green { gap } uh { gap } school board . Industrial Designer : Well it is n't , but maybe that thing is uh is { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , mu Industrial Designer : Yeah , board , a school board , yeah . User Interface : Yeah , but but then you can uh save it in instantly , and and and re-use it , and uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : I it has { disfmarker } It is useful . Yeah . Marketing : It saves time . Project Manager : Yeah yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : This uh if it works correct , maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : So uh if we get in uh if we get another one and you make sure it does work , Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : I think then it 's pretty useful . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Because uh yeah you can draw t things quickly and uh clearly for anyone uh in the discussion room . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And then you can save it immediately . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well , they are now . User Interface : Hmm .

Query : Summarize the presentation on the prototype . Industrial Designer : Uh it 's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we 'll begin uh with the front . We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there 's this part um { vocalsound } which is made of hard plastic , the front . And uh we 're we 're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : and later we 'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . { vocalsound } Um then we have uh the lower part { vocalsound } of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it 's also titanium . You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . User Interface : Yeah , it 's a double R_ , but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah ? User Interface : It 's a double R_ . Industrial Designer : It 's a double R_ . Yeah the logo { disfmarker } User Interface : But { vocalsound } it 's very difficult to to draw that in { disfmarker } Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , alright . Industrial Designer : Uh uh it 's difficult to draw so small , but it 's our double R_ uh logo is in there . Project Manager : Okay . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Um so that 's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner . Then we have the buttons . Uh it 's difficult to draw again the little oval or round { disfmarker } I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons . User Interface : Oval yeah . Project Manager : Alright . Industrial Designer : So { gap } uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m The m User Interface : Channel up and volume ? Industrial Designer : Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh { vocalsound } uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button 's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : And then we 've here the Menu button and the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Alright . User Interface : Menu for the L_C_D_ screen . Industrial Designer : And the video button . The { disfmarker } Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Marketing : Mm right . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen . Project Manager : 'Kay . Industrial Designer : Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want . Project Manager : Well if I look at it , the side the side view { disfmarker } User Interface : Well , at the back { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk User Interface : Yeah .

Project Manager : { gap } Industrial Designer : Um okay I 've had everything I guess on the front ? User Interface : No the back . With the logo and our uh l uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah the back . Yeah . { vocalsound } We thought about { disfmarker } Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . { vocalsound } And we thought about the logo big in the middle . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Maybe that 's too much Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : but you have to say uh say that if you think that way . User Interface : No I do n't think { disfmarker } And the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . 
Query : What did the Industrial Designer and the Project Manager discuss about the LCD screen ? Project Manager : They the the the the the side view , Industrial Designer : Side ? Uh oh the side ?

I think . Project Manager : No not totally . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Not totally , well { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } For me , I I would n't buy it . Let 's say it like that . Industrial Designer : Yeah but of course y you are also human . We have to take uh { vocalsound } every everyone into account . So { disfmarker } Project Manager : No { gap } { disfmarker } Marketing : And you might be uh { disfmarker } You might be target customer . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yes but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Well uh who who else thinks like you ? User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : We do n't know . Project Manager : Yeah , we do n't know , Industrial Designer : Maybe a thousand people , Project Manager : but that 's uh that 's that 's that 's more market research .

Industrial Designer : mean uh the the the the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . Marketing : Yeah , I agree . User Interface : { gap } If y { vocalsound } If you handle a remote , you you usually do n't have your hand straight like this . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } In the middle in the { disfmarker } User Interface : You you have it a bit uh { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : It depends on the size .

Query : What did the User Interface think of using titanium when discussing product cost and quotation ? User Interface : Why why do n't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , Marketing : That is pretty stupid . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : N not very practical . { vocalsound } Well { disfmarker } User Interface : uh titanium-coloured plastic ? Project Manager : Who ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : You want to dump the titanium ? User Interface : Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper . Project Manager : And make all plastic , then we ha then we 're there . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } But I 'm n I do n't agree . User Interface : But then we we 've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again . Industrial Designer : I think { disfmarker } Project Manager : Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy . User Interface : Ah no no . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : It 's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same . Project Manager : No , I do n't think so . User Interface : Well , I do think so .

Marketing : Because you have lots of functions { vocalsound } in it too . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , well yeah . Alright . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Why ca n't I { disfmarker } User Interface : But { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I agree with that . So we u we use uh { disfmarker } Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic . Project Manager : I 'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that 's trendy d these days . Marketing : Yeah , I agree . Industrial Designer : So titanium-coloured plastic for the back . Project Manager : I I 'll talk to the managers . { vocalsound } User Interface : No no no no . W Titanium stays there . Project Manager : Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah this is good , Marketing : Osl { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : but it it 's not good enough . { vocalsound } So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I 'm afraid .

Riot . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : What do we { disfmarker } Well what do we know ? All we want is a is a fancy design but we do n't really consider the costs . So { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes , yes . User Interface : No because we did not know anything about it . Project Manager : One and a half Euros . Hmm ? Industrial Designer : Yeah al alright , yeah . Marketing : If you do n't have the money , you ca n't make it . Industrial Designer : But we have to deal with it now . So { disfmarker } Marketing : So s If you do n't have the money , you ca n't make it . So this is too expensive . Project Manager : So ? Industrial Designer : So { disfmarker } Marketing : So we have to make it cheaper . Industrial Designer : Titanium gone and add plastic . User Interface : Yeah , but then we 've got money left . Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ? Project Manager : Well , no it 's just uh all plastic .

User Interface : Yeah . W Marketing : { vocalsound } 
Query : Why did the Industrial Designer disagree to replace the titanium when discussing product cost and quotation ? User Interface : Ah no no . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : It 's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same . Project Manager : No , I do n't think so . User Interface : Well , I do think so . Industrial Designer : I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the { disfmarker } Marketing : Y Project Manager : Yes . And the feel , User Interface : { gap } feel . Project Manager : and th that it is strong , and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i Marketing : Yeah , I agree . Industrial Designer : Alright it 's not our target audience , but it 's it 's useful if it 's uh important for old people . Project Manager : We still { vocalsound } we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : but not lose the one { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I think the titanium is very important . User Interface : Yeah alright but then we we wo n't get there . Industrial Designer : Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then . User Interface : We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think . Marketing : I do n't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen . Industrial Designer : Well what else ? User Interface : No , nothing . Industrial Designer : W I mean uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Or you shou { vocalsound } It 's { disfmarker } User Interface : Amen . Marketing : Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen . 
Query : Summarize the discussion about product quotation . User Interface : Why why do n't we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium , Marketing : That is pretty stupid . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : N not very practical . { vocalsound } Well { disfmarker } User Interface : uh titanium-coloured plastic ? Project Manager : Who ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : You want to dump the titanium ? User Interface : Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper . Project Manager : And make all plastic , then we ha then we 're there . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } But I 'm n I do n't agree . User Interface : But then we we 've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again . Industrial Designer : I think { disfmarker } Project Manager : Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy . User Interface : Ah no no . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : It 's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same . Project Manager : No , I do n't think so . User Interface : Well , I do think so . Industrial Designer : I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the { disfmarker } Marketing : Y Project Manager : Yes . And the feel , User Interface : { gap } feel . Project Manager : and th that it is strong , and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i Marketing : Yeah , I agree . Industrial Designer : Alright it 's not our target audience , but it 's it 's useful if it 's uh important for old people . Project Manager : We still { vocalsound } we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : but not lose the one { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I think the titanium is very important . User Interface : Yeah alright but then we we wo n't get there . Industrial Designer : Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then . User Interface : We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think . Marketing : I do n't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen . Industrial Designer : Well what else ? User Interface : No , nothing . Industrial Designer : W I mean uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Or you shou { vocalsound } It 's { disfmarker } User Interface : Amen . Marketing : Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Because you have lots of functions { vocalsound } in it too . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , well yeah . Alright . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Why ca n't I { disfmarker } User Interface : But { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I agree with that . So we u we use uh { disfmarker } Unfortunately . Um . Titanium-coloured plastic . Project Manager : I 'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that 's trendy d these days . 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Project Manager : Okay . So welcome back . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : What do { gap } { disfmarker } do we have to do ? { vocalsound } Marketing : { gap } . Project Manager : So first . I want to say I 'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your { disfmarker } in the map in the From the group . There 's the minutes from the first meeting . You 'll find the next minutes also there . Then { vocalsound } I wan na hear from you , what you 've done . And after that I have some new product requirements . So { disfmarker } And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we 're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we 'll have lunch . So first I wan na ask the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : That 's my task . Okay . Uh I 've { disfmarker } Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ? Hmm . I 've save it on my computer , my presentation . Project Manager : Yeah on your computer , or the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : But where ? Project Manager : What 's the name ? Industrial Designer : Uh uh uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : What 's the name of it ? Industrial Designer : It was about the working of the remote control . Project Manager : It 's the technical function or the functional requirements . Industrial Designer : Nope . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Not a { gap } of { disfmarker } Wait . The working design . But I 've saved it . Project Manager : Working design . Industrial Designer : But now I do n't know where it is . Hmm . Project Manager : Working design . What is this ? Product documents . Industrial Designer : Yeah . And I import this until { disfmarker } Project Manager : On the desktop . Up . { gap } up . Up . Up . Industrial Designer : One more . Project Manager : Up . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes . My Documents . Nope . Industrial Designer : What the fuck is this ? Project Manager : Gone . { vocalsound } Well you { disfmarker } Um { disfmarker } Nah . Nah , nah , nah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : PowerPoint . Working design . Industrial Designer : Yeah that 's the empty one . Project Manager : { vocalsound } And { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I had one . Project Manager : Presentation of working design . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . Open it . Okay here it is . Project Manager : Save as { gap } . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh it 's { disfmarker } Marketing : Desktop . Project Manager : Project { gap } . Industrial Designer : Project . Marketing : Yeah . Okay . Well . Project Manager : Save . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : Very good . Industrial Designer : A little later but here it is . Marketing : { gap } Project Manager : Okay . So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : So okay . It 's a little difficult what I 'm gon na tell you . It 's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : and { vocalsound } I do n't get it . Marketing : { vocalsound } Make it . Project Manager : Now have ten minutes to tell it . Industrial Designer : Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it { disfmarker } uh of it . Uh then I 'll have uh some kind of map , and it 's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you { disfmarker } I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I 'll think about it . First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who have n't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there 's a lot of uh plastic on it , Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : um because its uh not so expensive . And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There 's a lot of small uh electronics . So it wo n't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now { gap } { disfmarker } And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here 's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here 's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That 's what I said , it 's very difficult . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . That 's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all { vocalsound } we all do n't get it . My preferences ? It 's uh { disfmarker } it wo n't be uh { disfmarker } We should n't make it too big . Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a { gap } { disfmarker } menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : That 's { disfmarker } I think it 's easier . And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery 's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you 'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when { disfmarker } what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . This is uh just uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Oh oh . Two questions . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager : The battery . You say one battery is cheaper . Why ? Industrial Designer : If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two . Project Manager : Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer . Industrial Designer : Yeah but then we 'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting . Project Manager : Okay so it 's the size of the remote control . Industrial Designer : { gap } Just { disfmarker } Yeah . Project Manager : Okay and the buttons . When you use it on the television , you 've { disfmarker } you need the television , wh which can use it . Industrial Designer : Yeah . But uh I think this { disfmarker } our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ? Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Or is it also for other company { disfmarker } uh for other televisions ? Project Manager : I think we have to use it also on other televisions though . Industrial Designer : Then this is an option . { vocalsound } Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we wo n't use the Project Manager : Yeah but I do n't { disfmarker } I think it { disfmarker } { vocalsound } They are two different things though . We have to choose one . It has to work on o uh all televisions . User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Okay . Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . And we will uh look forward and do n't make a remote control which for the older televisions . Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : And I just uh have one more idea . Uh maybe it 's one of your tasks . But { disfmarker } Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers . So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it . Marketing : Hmm . Industrial Designer : And also different things . Project Manager : Yeah . Good idea . Industrial Designer : Yes . Marketing : Will this will this add to the cost ? Industrial Designer : Uh then it wo n't be { disfmarker } uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . And then you can buy the covers . Marketing : Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D does it make it more difficult to design ? Industrial Designer : I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Not much . 'Kay . Industrial Designer : Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones . Project Manager : Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones . Industrial Designer : Just one . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah but then we 'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . If it wo n't works then we 'll get something else . Then we uh wo n't g uh go further with it . Project Manager : Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ? Industrial Designer : Uh a p a { disfmarker } { vocalsound } a cover made in uh in China , it it wo n't be I guess so expensive I think . Project Manager : Yeah but there are also design cost . I do n't think { disfmarker } When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? Would you change the cover ? Industrial Designer : Maybe . I wi I wo n't . Project Manager : No . Industrial Designer : But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : N yeah but { disfmarker } I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Okay . And the other people ? What do you think about it ? { vocalsound } Marketing : Um { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah it 's a good idea . But { disfmarker } If if it { disfmarker } Yeah , I do n't { disfmarker } I 'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : { gap } User Interface : But it 's uh yeah it 's uh original idea . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes it is but I do n't think we have to do it . User Interface : No . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : You 're the Project Manager . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yes . That 's it . Project Manager : That 's clear . { vocalsound } Okay thank you . So now the User Interface Designer . User Interface : Oh . That 's me . Uh { disfmarker } Come on . { gap } . Ah . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh { disfmarker } for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television . And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh { disfmarker } and maybe uh teletext or something like that . Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that 's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh { disfmarker } We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ . { vocalsound } Yeah well that 's our dilemma . Um any ideas about that ? Basic or multifunctional ? Project Manager : We 'll got back on that later . User Interface : Okay yeah . Yeah well the { disfmarker } that was just on my mind . Marketing : Yes . User Interface : So uh I did n't know what uh what way we would go . Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : 'Kay . Project Manager : 'Kay , thank you . Then it 's your turn , the marketing expert . Marketing : Okay . Uh um m Yeah . { vocalsound } Um yeah okay . This bit too far . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : So { disfmarker } So I 'm uh gon na have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not . Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy . And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings . Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . Uh not important they found the audio , uh that 's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I do n't think uh , I { vocalsound } I think the younger will be most interest in it . But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the { gap } we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . Now you can clearly see young users say { gap } . I will { disfmarker } that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change { vocalsound } I think . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : And they wo n't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that 's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two { disfmarker } several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . And um they are more critical on their money spending . Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent . So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh { disfmarker } also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group does n't say that old people wo n't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it 's hard to use , remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that 's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I do n't know what 's uh good thing of speech recognition . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Um well th uh that 's my second point . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . It 's about discussion we had earlier . Um { disfmarker } You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . So uh you do n't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that . That were my findings . Project Manager : Okay thank you . Industrial Designer : Yeah . I have uh one question . Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Uh I think we do n't have that in our budget . Marketing : Yes . User Interface : No . Industrial Designer : Do you think ? Marketing : No . User Interface : And I do n't uh I do n't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something . Industrial Designer : Like { disfmarker } No . No . User Interface : So it 's { disfmarker } Yeah , it 's hard to uh get the younger group . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . Project Manager : I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Just the L_C_D_ ? Project Manager : Yes . Only the L_C_D_ . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } But we 'll come back on that . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Now { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Oh , go on . What d d d um { disfmarker } Um { disfmarker } Uh we go { gap } { disfmarker } back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we do n't need the teletext anymore . So not necessary . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Next . Only for the television . So we do n't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . Fourth point . { vocalsound } Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Next . Um no . We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So { vocalsound } like you said , we need the { disfmarker } { gap } . Maybe it 's good to put it in a document . Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us . Marketing : Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said . Project Manager : Sorry ? Marketing : The the requirements you just said , Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : maybe we should first have a discussion about that . Project Manager : Yes , it 's okay . Marketing : I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news . Project Manager : Yeah but we do n't use it . It 's a { disfmarker } { vocalsound } new requirement . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So , it 's not my requirement . Industrial Designer : 'Kay , we 'll just have to do that . Project Manager : We have to do this . Industrial Designer : Okay . No discussion about it . Marketing : Okay . Okay sorry . Project Manager : No . Marketing : Then uh { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Okay . { vocalsound } Unfortunately . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So what controls do we need ? Who first ? User Interface : Well a power button ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . Uh power . User Interface : Uh the well um I think separate channels . So { disfmarker } Project Manager : Uh mm channel . User Interface : But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something . Project Manager : Channel { disfmarker } Zero to nine . User Interface : Uh volume . Project Manager : Volume . Maybe it 's easy to pick . What was w your one ? Techno Marketing : Mine ? It 's the functional requirements . Project Manager : Okay . We had w uh no no no no . Where was that example of the { disfmarker } User Interface : Oh mine . Project Manager : Johan . That was the { disfmarker } the the the the { disfmarker } { gap } User Interface : Technical . Project Manager : technical { disfmarker } Hallo . Okay . What do we need ? On-off . Zero to nine . Industrial Designer : To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down . Project Manager : Yeah that 's the channel . Marketing : D Yeah . Do we make a menu ? Project Manager : Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : { gap } { disfmarker } M Menu . I think um the only one or two numbers . User Interface : Mm yes . Project Manager : And { disfmarker } Hello ? That 's ch { vocalsound } Marketing : { gap } I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection , Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the { disfmarker } then to scroll through the menu and to change the options . Project Manager : On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ? Marketing : Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control . Project Manager : Think it 's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So Marketing : Yes . Project Manager : we need { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : But then we come to the costs . Project Manager : N Yes . But if we have this { disfmarker } Marketing : 'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it 's a bit more cost , it will still sell . Project Manager : So now we do n't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ? User Interface : Mute . Project Manager : Mute . Maybe in the menu ? User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : Mm . User Interface : Yeah but then it 's always uh more than one uh thing to do . Project Manager : Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Maybe more ? { vocalsound } { vocalsound } No . Well . Then that 's all . This will be the buttons . And { disfmarker } I think that 's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : But now we have only the buttons . Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : And uh we do n't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or { disfmarker } Project Manager : No that 's for the next phase . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : Um { gap } { disfmarker } Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we 'll have the concepts . Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay . Project Manager : That 's for the { disfmarker } So uh next point . Now we have lunch-break . After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No . Your individual action , you can find them in the email . So now it 's time for lunch . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : Okay . Good idea . Project Manager : Thanks for coming . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } 
Query : What did Industrial Designer say about the structure of the device ? Industrial Designer : First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it { disfmarker } uh of it . Uh then I 'll have uh some kind of map , and it 's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you { disfmarker } I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I 'll think about it . First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who have n't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there 's a lot of uh plastic on it , Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : um because its uh not so expensive . And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There 's a lot of small uh electronics . So it wo n't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it . Now { gap } { disfmarker } And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here 's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here 's the battery . And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That 's what I said , it 's very difficult . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television . That 's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all { vocalsound } we all do n't get it . My preferences ? It 's uh { disfmarker } it wo n't be uh { disfmarker } We should n't make it too big . Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it . We can also make uh a button uh with a { gap } { disfmarker } menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : That 's { disfmarker } I think it 's easier . And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery 's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you 'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when { disfmarker } what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it . This is uh just uh { disfmarker } 
Query : What did Project Manager question about the Industrial Designer 's presentation ? Project Manager : Oh oh . Two questions . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager : The battery . You say one battery is cheaper . Why ? Industrial Designer : If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two . Project Manager : Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer . Industrial Designer : Yeah but then we 'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting . Project Manager : Okay so it 's the size of the remote control . Industrial Designer : { gap } Just { disfmarker } Yeah . Project Manager : Okay and the buttons . When you use it on the television , you 've { disfmarker } you need the television , wh which can use it . Industrial Designer : Yeah . But uh I think this { disfmarker } our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ? Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Or is it also for other company { disfmarker } uh for other televisions ? Project Manager : I think we have to use it also on other televisions though . Industrial Designer : Then this is an option . { vocalsound } Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we wo n't use the Project Manager : Yeah but I do n't { disfmarker } I think it { disfmarker } { vocalsound } They are two different things though . We have to choose one . It has to work on o uh all televisions . User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Okay . Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions . And we will uh look forward and do n't make a remote control which for the older televisions . Marketing : Hmm . 
Query : What did the team think about the new idea of Industrial Designer concerning the cover of the device ? Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : And I just uh have one more idea . Uh maybe it 's one of your tasks . But { disfmarker } Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers . So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it . Marketing : Hmm . Industrial Designer : And also different things . Project Manager : Yeah . Good idea . Industrial Designer : Yes . Marketing : Will this will this add to the cost ? Industrial Designer : Uh then it wo n't be { disfmarker } uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . And then you can buy the covers . Marketing : Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D does it make it more difficult to design ? Industrial Designer : I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Not much . 'Kay . Industrial Designer : Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones . Project Manager : Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones . Industrial Designer : Just one . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah but then we 'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . If it wo n't works then we 'll get something else . Then we uh wo n't g uh go further with it . Project Manager : Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost ? Industrial Designer : Uh a p a { disfmarker } { vocalsound } a cover made in uh in China , it it wo n't be I guess so expensive I think . Project Manager : Yeah but there are also design cost . I do n't think { disfmarker } When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? Would you change the cover ? Industrial Designer : Maybe . I wi I wo n't . Project Manager : No . Industrial Designer : But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : N yeah but { disfmarker } I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Okay . And the other people ? What do you think about it ? { vocalsound } Marketing : Um { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah it 's a good idea . But { disfmarker } If if it { disfmarker } Yeah , I do n't { disfmarker } I 'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : { gap } User Interface : But it 's uh yeah it 's uh original idea . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes it is but I do n't think we have to do it . User Interface : No . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : You 're the Project Manager . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yes . That 's it . 
Query : What did User Interface say about the technical function design ? Project Manager : That 's clear . { vocalsound } Okay thank you . So now the User Interface Designer . User Interface : Oh . That 's me . Uh { disfmarker } Come on . { gap } . Ah . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh { disfmarker } for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set . Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting . Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television . And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh { disfmarker } and maybe uh teletext or something like that . Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that 's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh { disfmarker } We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more . Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ . { vocalsound } Yeah well that 's our dilemma . Um any ideas about that ? Basic or multifunctional ? Project Manager : We 'll got back on that later . User Interface : Okay yeah . Yeah well the { disfmarker } that was just on my mind . Marketing : Yes . User Interface : So uh I did n't know what uh what way we would go . Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk { vocalsound } . 
Query : What was the finding of the market ? Marketing : So { disfmarker } So I 'm uh gon na have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls . Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not . Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy . And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings . Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection . And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important . Uh not important they found the audio , uh that 's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings . Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups . Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I do n't think uh , I { vocalsound } I think the younger will be most interest in it . But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the { gap } we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . Now you can clearly see young users say { gap } . I will { disfmarker } that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change { vocalsound } I think . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : And they wo n't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that 's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two { disfmarker } several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here . And um they are more critical on their money spending . Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent . So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh { disfmarker } also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group does n't say that old people wo n't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it 's hard to use , remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that 's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested . And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I do n't know what 's uh good thing of speech recognition . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Um well th uh that 's my second point . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . It 's about discussion we had earlier . Um { disfmarker } You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . So uh you do n't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one . But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that . That were my findings . 
Query : What did the team discuss about the new features ? Industrial Designer : If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Uh I think we do n't have that in our budget . Marketing : Yes . User Interface : No . Industrial Designer : Do you think ? Marketing : No . User Interface : And I do n't uh I do n't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something . Industrial Designer : Like { disfmarker } No . No . User Interface : So it 's { disfmarker } Yeah , it 's hard to uh get the younger group . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . Project Manager : I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Just the L_C_D_ ? Project Manager : Yes . Only the L_C_D_ . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } But we 'll come back on that . 
Query : What did the team say about the new product requirements ? Project Manager : Now { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Oh , go on . What d d d um { disfmarker } Um { disfmarker } Uh we go { gap } { disfmarker } back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we do n't need the teletext anymore . So not necessary . Project Manager : So what controls do we need ? Who first ? User Interface : Well a power button ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . Uh power . User Interface : Uh the well um I think separate channels . So { disfmarker } Project Manager : Uh mm channel . User Interface : But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something . Project Manager : Channel { disfmarker } Zero to nine . User Interface : Uh volume . Project Manager : Volume . Maybe it 's easy to pick . What was w your one ? Techno Marketing : Mine ? It 's the functional requirements . Project Manager : Okay . We had w uh no no no no . Where was that example of the { disfmarker } User Interface : Oh mine . Project Manager : Johan . That was the { disfmarker } the the the the { disfmarker } { gap } User Interface : Technical . Project Manager : technical { disfmarker } Hallo . Okay . What do we need ? On-off . Zero to nine . Industrial Designer : To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down . Project Manager : Yeah that 's the channel . Marketing : D Yeah . Do we make a menu ? Project Manager : Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus . Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : { gap } { disfmarker } M Menu . I think um the only one or two numbers . User Interface : Mm yes . Project Manager : And { disfmarker } Hello ? That 's ch { vocalsound } Marketing : { gap } I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection , Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the { disfmarker } then to scroll through the menu and to change the options . Project Manager : On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ? Marketing : Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control . Project Manager : Think it 's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions . So Marketing : Yes . Project Manager : we need { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : But then we come to the costs . Project Manager : N Yes . But if we have this { disfmarker } Marketing : 'Kay . But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control . And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it 's a bit more cost , it will still sell . Project Manager : So now we do n't have a lot of buttons . Is this enough ? User Interface : Mute . Project Manager : Mute . Maybe in the menu ? User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : Mm . User Interface : Yeah but then it 's always uh more than one uh thing to do . Project Manager : Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Maybe more ? { vocalsound } { vocalsound } No . Well . Then that 's all . This will be the buttons . And { disfmarker } I think that 's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to { disfmarker } 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Marketing : Great man . Who starts ? Project Manager : Well I 'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting . Marketing : Alright , great . Alright . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . I 've put some uh new things in the in the map . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Uh oh . { vocalsound } This is it . I do n't know the shortcut , so { disfmarker } Ah F_ five . Well our functional design meeting , that 's the stage we 're in . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it . Marketing : Yes . Project Manager : Well um in we 'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided . But uh { disfmarker } Uh then we 'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you . I think you have prepared uh all three uh ? { vocalsound } Marketing : 'Kay . Industrial Designer : Well , yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Um we 'll look at th the new project requirements we uh { disfmarker } I dunno . Y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ? Industrial Designer : No . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Oh I 've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , Marketing : No . You 're the only one . { vocalsound } Project Manager : and I 'll have a look if { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Oh . Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it 's not really uh smart uh to uh to include some things uh we ca n't , because of the new requirements . Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . Marketing : 'Kay . Project Manager : We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . Uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ? Project Manager : Uh yeah , I think so . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Alright . Project Manager : Well uh { gap } the closing uh we 'll not uh look at it yet . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : Um { vocalsound } now I 'll look at { gap } show { gap } this board . Um { disfmarker } Well uh notes , first meeting . Now . I gave a disc a a presentation . Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . So we said that uh we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . Industrial Designer : Huh ? Project Manager : Uh not too many one buttons . One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . { vocalsound } It 's uh one of our ideas . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah well that wa It 's just thirty minutes ago , User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : so it 's not quite uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } But well I have to do it . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm , now it 's right . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from { gap } , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . It should be uh recognisable at all times . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : It 's meant to be easily wiped out , yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : Mm . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Well fronts were to be { gap } just like mobile telephones . And uh the technical aspects um { disfmarker } And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . Well that 's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . It 's quite logical al all of it . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Um now the new project requirements , I 'll just show them . I got this mail from uh our bosses . Well , teletext goes out . We will not use teletext . User Interface : Oh . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext . Industrial Designer : I I disagree , but uh it 's not uh t it 's not my place to disagree I guess . Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ User Interface : Oh . Project Manager : and they do n't want it , because of our time we have for this project . Marketing : Alright . Industrial Designer : Oh , alright . User Interface : Oh , that 's a shame . Project Manager : So that 's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . Because uh we do n't have those customers a lot at th at this point . Um well it 's a bit pity because it 's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it . Marketing : Yeah . But let 's forget about it . It 's just time-consuming , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : so we uh have to go on . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um { disfmarker } Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company . Marketing : Yes . Industrial Designer : Yeah , we are a { vocalsound } real fashionable company . I read uh I read it on the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . { vocalsound } Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I did n't know what company we were , Marketing : Mm . Industrial Designer : but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Okay . Industrial Designer : So it has to be uh a modern design . That 's important to know , uh when you design a thing of course . Project Manager : Yes . I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . It 's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : So maybe that 's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something . Marketing : Right . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Alright then um we 're going to uh have three presentations . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : You want to start ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } I think I have to start . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Oh you have to start ? I did n't see anything about uh who had to start . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } The order ? No . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Oh no , no problem . Project Manager : Well s then start . User Interface : Mm . Marketing : I I just have to uh to think which file 's mine , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : 'cause I was uh bit in a hurry . Project Manager : Okay . Well uh { disfmarker } Marketing : I think it 's this one . But I 'm not sure . { gap } Project Manager : { gap } You already uh opened uh PowerPoint . Marketing : Hmm ? Yeah . S Right . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yes . This is it . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Well , I 'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Um to start with these points . Uh next sheet ? Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it 's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . Uh , furthermore it 's very important what they do like and what they do use . { vocalsound } Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I 'll um show you our target { vocalsound } audience or our target product users , customers . Well , { vocalsound } um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : That 's seventy five per cent of the current users . They do n't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . Um { disfmarker } They also say , that 's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it 's very important that you design a a nice looking control . { vocalsound } Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it 's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . Furthermore , it 's uh { vocalsound } seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } You can zap away . Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , yeah right . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Right . A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their { vocalsound } in their living room . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that 's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : I dunno , maybe that 's an idea . Industrial Designer : Oh . Marketing : 'Cause it 's uh a big { disfmarker } I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Oh ? Project Manager : It should actually uh { disfmarker } It should actually be loose from the television , User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : because it can also be used for other televisions . So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . Marketing : Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ? Project Manager : No you can click it on your television . Marketing : Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah in another room , yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well yes . Marketing : Nee but it it specifically says it 's uh the the control is lost in the same room . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So { disfmarker } Well a beeping device would be { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well we 'll have a look at it , yeah . Marketing : Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it 's it 's too uh too difficult to learn . So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah but people do n't read manuals . Industrial Designer : I did n't read it ? User Interface : No . Industrial Designer : Oh , alright . Marketing : No . Industrial Designer : { gap } users to uh add one ? Do you think ? User Interface : I do n't think { disfmarker } Marketing : I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual . User Interface : Yeah . Yes you should { disfmarker } You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it 's supposed to work . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : Yeah alright . Because they do n't use it ? Alright . Project Manager : Well there sh should always be a menu , Marketing : Yeah . Right . Project Manager : but it c can be very short . Marketing : And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . User Interface : Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think . Project Manager : Yes okay . Industrial Designer : Well maybe for the { disfmarker } If you do n't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I do n't know it ? Marketing : Alright . User Interface : Yeah right . It sh it should be there , the manual . But but not to explain how the remote works . Only { disfmarker } { gap } Marketing : And we do n't have much time . So it 's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than { disfmarker } I think . Project Manager : Well we are a design team , User Interface : Hmm . Project Manager : we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Is n't it part of the of the u Marketing : Yeah right , right . Project Manager : So User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No . No . Never mind . Project Manager : Well we 'll have a look . Um yes ? Marketing : Next point . Um R_S_I_ . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Well that 's about twenty per cent I thought . But uh the designer should uh take it uh { vocalsound } should uh { disfmarker } Wie zeg ik dat ? Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote . Industrial Designer : Consider the m Yeah . Marketing : It should be a good in your hand . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Yep . Marketing : Right , this is the most important part . Um , we 're { disfmarker } Like the requirements said , we 're gon na specify of we 're gon na target a younger audience . Um , { vocalsound } that 's about sixty per cent of the market , so it 's uh quite important . Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . Uh { disfmarker } I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : So it 's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs . Project Manager : Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we ca n't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : It 's going to be expensive . Yeah . User Interface : No . Marketing : Yeah but { vocalsound } they think it 's really important . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : So if we want to s If we have a big { disfmarker } { vocalsound } If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno . We have to uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Well we 'll uh consider it uh . Project Manager : Yeah well uh it 's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : We 'll think abo we 'll think { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , I do n't know . I do n't have any information on that . So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Nigh User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : I know . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No , we 'll look we 'll look into that later . Alright ? Marketing : Right . And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . They also like that , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : but research is very uh costly . So { disfmarker } User Interface : I think that 's uh difficult to realise also . Marketing : Yeah , but { vocalsound } it { vocalsound } it might be important for the sale . Industrial Designer : We have very demanding clients . Project Manager : It 's not yet a standard uh development uh those so { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think . Project Manager : We sh Marketing : Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . Project Manager : Yeah absolutely . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : So we might consider L_C_D_ screens . User Interface : { vocalsound } No . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , alright . Well we 'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : We do n't rule them out uh yet . Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : { gap } 'Kay . Marketing : Alright . Um , I think that 's it . Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Alright . Marketing : I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : So you can { disfmarker } Right . Project Manager : Well you { disfmarker } I c I can uh still see your presentation . Marketing : Yeah . Right . Project Manager : It 's in the { disfmarker } Well uh next um I dunno who is next . User Interface : Oh you go . Industrial Designer : Shall I give a technical talk ? Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : Alright . Project Manager : Well go ahead . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design . Project Manager : Yip . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } We have that here . Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the { disfmarker } Project Manager : F_ five . Industrial Designer : F_ F_ five . Project Manager : { vocalsound } F_ five . Industrial Designer : Yep . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well , the working design , Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : that 's my uh { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Next button . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well alright uh , you know who I am and what I do . So uh we have this . It 's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something . It was originally in black and white Marketing : Oh right . Industrial Designer : but it became black and purple . Marketing : Purple { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : But I think you can read it . User Interface : { vocalsound } { gap } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , yeah , yeah . A bit . Industrial Designer : Um well um I think it 's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . Uh well you can see uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Maybe you can select it . So it uh inverts . Industrial Designer : { gap } And I then can select I can select on the dings { gap } It goes to the next page . Marketing : { gap } the p the whole picture . Project Manager : Click . { vocalsound } Marketing : Nah , uh never mind . Industrial Designer : Well , you can read it , User Interface : Yeah , go ahead . Industrial Designer : it 's not too difficult . Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . Marketing : Yeah . Alright . Industrial Designer : And uh the source is of course the user . Uh the user interface is um { vocalsound } uh the { vocalsound } the { gap } the buttons of course . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And the { vocalsound } the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver . That 's the that 's the basic idea . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : Very basic . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Um well I have uh { vocalsound } uh { vocalsound } put it in a in in in a { vocalsound } a couple of basic steps . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . The key { gap } a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . { vocalsound } uh and recognise the key . So { vocalsound } well you understand . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it 's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the { vocalsound } the signal , and performs the assigned task . Project Manager : So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I 'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that . And a button for T_V_ . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Ah bu Yeah , but we do n't . Uh we { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No no , but { disfmarker } Yeah . Exactly . Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I 've some couple of pictures here . It 's a very basic one . And uh { gap } if we if we 're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it , it uh wo n't look anything like this , but { disfmarker } This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . It has uh very little buttons and { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : But it it uh it 's it 's quite um { disfmarker } Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . They 're uh far enough apart and an anything . It 's not very um uh not very high-tech uh User Interface : High tech . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : indeed , and it 's not very user-friendly . Uh if you look at the shape , it 's uh just a simple long box uh shape . So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing do n't do n't oc do n't occur . Marketing : Right . Can I say something ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . Well teletext is not an option , so that uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : But I think it 's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you ca n't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . Industrial Designer : Yeah , because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately { disfmarker } Marketing : Right . Make them big , make them easy to uh to press . Project Manager : Well but but { vocalsound } User Interface : You can also like { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : You do n't have to look and and search for them . Project Manager : if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves . Marketing : Right . User Interface : Yeah , I was thinking you can { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , right . Right . Project Manager : But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : and that 's on of the things about R_S_I_ . User Interface : Are some of the the the um { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , that 's right . That 's right . That 's right . Industrial Designer : Well you you ca n't have any uh every button { vocalsound } under the thumb , of course . Marketing : We Project Manager : No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . Marketing : But { disfmarker } Yeah . That 's very important . And { disfmarker } User Interface : Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some Project Manager : Yes I 've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons . Marketing : But is that is that useable ? User Interface : Hmm ? Marketing : Do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : It 's a f it 's a new feature , Project Manager : Well it it 's { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it . User Interface : Yeah alright , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well also i if someone puts { vocalsound } picks up his uh remote { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they 'll understand it { gap } , I think . Project Manager : Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he 's a already on the next channel . User Interface : Eighty per cent would . Industrial Designer : Well , { gap } . Marketing : Yeah , he feels it immediately . Project Manager : That 's very irritating , I think . User Interface : Yeah that 's true . Marketing : Yeah , that 's right . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Right , continue . Industrial Designer : But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . Marketing : Sorry . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I think that 's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they do n't use it uh all the time . Well it 's uh pretty pretty { vocalsound } basically uh as you said . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I do n't want to get too technical , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : because uh that 's not uh very uh useful for you . Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 's your part of the job . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , that 's right . Industrial Designer : So yeah { gap } exactly { gap } this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : And uh well that 's about it I think . Oh yeah , I still have this . Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new { disfmarker } Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . Industrial Designer : But I had too too little time , Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : but uh do n't uh do n't look at it please . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well we understand . Industrial Designer : I I think it 's it 's clear uh how it works . Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : We understand . Marketing : Yeah , it 's clear . Project Manager : Oh right , no . Industrial Designer : Alright . That 's the most important thing . Project Manager : Nice . Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation . Industrial Designer : Alright . Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : How late is did we start his presentation uh ? { gap } Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : { vocalsound } I dunno . I think uh w About twenty minutes ago ? Project Manager : Wha Yeah . Marketing : Losing time losing time . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well then we have still the time , so { disfmarker } { vocalsound } But we do have to come to a decision , right later on . Marketing : Yeah right . So { disfmarker } Project Manager : So { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { gap } User Interface : Well I thought um everybody on the website { vocalsound } uh would see the same thing , but obviously { vocalsound } that 's not the case . Marketing : I do n't think so . Industrial Designer : Yeah , uh there are different uh { disfmarker } We have all have different home pages , with different links . Project Manager : Oh yeah ? User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah right . Project Manager : Uh ? User Interface : For instance you could n't see this . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay , yeah well . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Yeah . Well I 'm Mike { gap } , User Interface Designer . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : The the method ? Well { disfmarker } I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : These are already in use ? User Interface : Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer . Marketing : Alright , okay . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : Well { disfmarker } Project Manager : I like user-centred . Marketing : Yeah , me too . User Interface : I like user-centr centred uh { vocalsound } uh also the best . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . We also do that . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . Marketing : Mm . User Interface : Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . Marketing : But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ? User Interface : But { disfmarker } Yes . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Th that 's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Alright . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we 'll need . Marketing : Yeah , right . User Interface : { vocalsound } I um I kinda like the shape . { vocalsound } I think this is what we talked about . But { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { gap } You ca n't really see uh the differ from different sides . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : But I think uh { disfmarker } User Interface : No I 've { disfmarker } Well I showed it somewhere . Um { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh you can draw it if you { disfmarker } Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Oh yeah . I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : So we can can uh yeah customise the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . So we can not just uh make someone w User Interface : Mm ? { vocalsound } Yeah . { vocalsound } It 's a front . It 's not the the whole remote that changes , of course . Project Manager : No but that 's th the side they look uh look at is the front . User Interface : You can { disfmarker } Marketing : But it { disfmarker } Project Manager : So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone . User Interface : Mm . Marketing : Yeah , that 's right User Interface : Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . Marketing : Yeah , that 's a must . User Interface : So l like Ericsson does { gap } every uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , we must . Industrial Designer : We can put it on the on the back side . Marketing : We must have that . Project Manager : Yeah well and and { disfmarker } User Interface : S something like this . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : It 's recognisable . Project Manager : 'Kay . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : We can make a symbol of the company right here . And { vocalsound } if you put a front on it , there 's a hole on the front . So the symbol 's always on User Interface : Yeah ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , so that you do n't replace the symbol , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah yeah yeah . User Interface : Yeah yeah . Something like that , Project Manager : Or the th the the lowest part of the remote is n't changed by the front . User Interface : in the { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : { disfmarker } Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Those kind of things . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : But let 's not focus on the front { gap } . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes . Okay . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Well so uh uh like I said I thought we 'd we 'd use more function . If we we had to include more functions . But we do n't . So um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Yeah . I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . Marketing : Alright . User Interface : Maybe some less . Like eject we do n't need , and some other buttons we do n't need . I think uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ? User Interface : Yeah , I will . I think uh for the remote um uh less is more . { vocalsound } The less buttons the better the design . Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : We should go with that concept I think . Marketing : Yeah , I agree . User Interface : I know . Project Manager : Alright . Marketing : I 've I 've got another point . Project Manager : Yeah ? Marketing : Um there are two target audi audiences , and we 've uh chose for the younger one . User Interface : Mm . Marketing : Um , research has shown that um it 's a high interested uh in features . They are high high interested in feature . But they are more critical . Fo Yeah , critical . Industrial Designer : The younger uh { disfmarker } Marketing : So { disfmarker } The younger audience . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people . Project Manager : Well what if we um { disfmarker } I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : a f a little uh { disfmarker } You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people do n't use but s some do do . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh { vocalsound } uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Clip are n't used much . Project Manager : Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot , Industrial Designer : No um mm usually { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah right . Industrial Designer : But { disfmarker } Project Manager : but not { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah , but what kind of features ? Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . Industrial Designer : Yeah I think { vocalsound } m most { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah but { disfmarker } Yeah . User Interface : But I 've { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Most uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Here , look at these numbers . The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control . Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Uh . Marketing : You see ? So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Competitors . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Our competitor . Yeah . Marketing : The concurrent ? { vocalsound } Competitors , right . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } So , I do think we have to uh have some features . Project Manager : Yeah . Well maybe w we could uh s Marketing : Even though they cost a little more . Project Manager : On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , Marketing : Right . Right . Project Manager : or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . And if if that 's gives you a little bit of sta status information . Marketing : Like a ticker-tape . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Which programme you are l watching or something . User Interface : Yeah , that 's nice . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s . And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you 're currently watching . Marketing : Yeah , right . Yeah right . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen . { vocalsound } Project Manager : For example . It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . User Interface : Yeah , we should keep that simple too . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : It will { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well maybe . Marketing : No not clickable . User Interface : No , it should be uh integrated . Industrial Designer : or { vocalsound } or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . { vocalsound } Marketing : Nah , no no no . User Interface : I think { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , just at at the top . So when you s { vocalsound } you sit like this you can can watch . Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah , Marketing : I think it should be at the top . User Interface : something like on um some radios in car . You { disfmarker } Where it 's , yeah , walking to { disfmarker } Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah right . It 's a ticker-tape idea . Project Manager : R_D_S_s or something . Industrial Designer : But that 's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and { vocalsound } that kind of thing . User Interface : Wa Yeah . Project Manager : Well I think it 's you got { disfmarker } It just means it 's a script that 's uh keeps it uh rolling , Marketing : Well it 's just one script . { vocalsound } Project Manager : and it 's not uh { disfmarker } That 's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : So I do n't think that 's the issue . Project Manager : No . Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? Project Manager : Uh well I think so , yes . Um { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . Marketing : 'Kay . Right , I do n't know if I can find that , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : We 're g No but we 're we 'll have to look into that . User Interface : Or maybe you will get that information uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Um we can use this board again , I think . Marketing : Next time . Yeah right . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue . { vocalsound } Where is my presentation ? { vocalsound } Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , I understand what you 're saying . Project Manager : { gap } Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : We should have a general idea of how it 's gon na look . Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } I mean we 're all here now , I think . These I 've already given you . So we have to decide on the different remote control functions . So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that 's special . Marketing : Right . At the top . Industrial Designer : Should n't we start with the most important parts ? Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : At the top or at the bottom ? Industrial Designer : The L_C_D_ screen alright { gap } but we should start with the power button ? Marketing : I think the top is more uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah but { disfmarker } Marketing : When you s How do you zap ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : You just sit in your chair ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Huh ? User Interface : Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . Marketing : With the remote ? Project Manager : That thing is terrible . User Interface : 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah but that 's where your hand ball might be . Project Manager : Uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah , no Mm . Marketing : Yeah , I dunno . Industrial Designer : And then uh { disfmarker } Marketing : We 'll draw two , and then we 'll see uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . { vocalsound } I dunno what uh you were talking about but { disfmarker } Marketing : No { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { gap } we are busy with something { gap } . Marketing : Um he thinks { disfmarker } Yeah , right . He thinks it 's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it 's better at the top . Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . Why do you think it 's better at the bottom ? User Interface : Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . Marketing : But your { disfmarker } User Interface : I c Industrial Designer : But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there 's room for the for the interface . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Well I d I think that 's that 's ugly but { disfmarker } Marketing : The the ticker { disfmarker } The L_C_D_ is like like small . { vocalsound } It 's it 's wide . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . Marketing : It 's not not high . But { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , User Interface : { vocalsound } I th Industrial Designer : And and we can { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . User Interface : Yeah . Power button always { disfmarker } Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Bottom . Project Manager : So and and I I like to use the ones on the top . User Interface : Yeah , y you got ta zap like this or { vocalsound } you want to { disfmarker } Yeah . Project Manager : So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah right . But { disfmarker } We 're making a remote with { vocalsound } with a few functions you know . Industrial Designer : Well { vocalsound } that 's { vocalsound } a bit exaggerated . Well , I agree with you { gap } . It 's it 's also more recognisable . Marketing : We Industrial Designer : It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes but we we we we do n't want that . User Interface : Yeah you do n't want { disfmarker } Project Manager : We do n't want them to look like a calculator . User Interface : You want uh { disfmarker } Yeah it it it must be a remote . Project Manager : We want to look it like our original but familiar { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah w well , User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : but uh you do n't have to throw uh um important aspe { vocalsound } important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , Marketing : High-tech { gap } . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yea Industrial Designer : uh because { vocalsound } I think it 's uh { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } We White ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I think it 's still important to have it at the top , Marketing : Width . Project Manager : Width . Uh format yeah format ? Line width ? Width ? Industrial Designer : because it 's uh it 's more familiar that way . Marketing : { gap } Th that 's not a problem . Project Manager : Yeah ? Marketing : { vocalsound } When I draw here it User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { disfmarker } Oh . Huh ? Project Manager : It 's a bit off . Marketing : Yeah , it 's off . Project Manager : Well . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } A little a little bit . Marketing : { vocalsound } It { vocalsound } it needs to be calibrated again . Well { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well uh let 's uh talk about that later uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Maybe you should another pen . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Maybe that 's uh better . { gap } You e you only have one pen for that screen . Yeah . Marketing : Where ? Project Manager : It 's special pen . Marketing : { vocalsound } Alright , we have to make a decision now , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : because we do n't have much time . Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : No . Marketing : I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . Industrial Designer : Yeah . I I agree . Project Manager : I think it should be at the button , bottom . Bottom . The L_C_D_ . User Interface : At the bottom ? Industrial Designer : Well I 'm the { vocalsound } I I 'm the designer , so um { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } In a few minutes { disfmarker } Marketing : At the bot User Interface : Oh yeah , oh yeah , I totally agree . Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : So { disfmarker } We are two uh V_S_ two . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , User Interface : { vocalsound } He 's the boss . { vocalsound } Project Manager : and then look at the design . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Right . Great . Industrial Designer : Uh we uh we were busy with that . Project Manager : Because we have to decide this . Industrial Designer : Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So , we have the power button . Marketing : And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s . Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : It 's uh your it 's your job . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well we have a power button . Industrial Designer : Yeah of course . Uh it 's uh . Yeah . W wh User Interface : No it 's our job . Project Manager : Guys ? User Interface : For all of us I think . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : While you have to agree , I can say { gap } it 's like this and { vocalsound } you must agree . Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , right . Project Manager : Guys ? Marketing : Alright , let 's keep it central . Project Manager : { vocalsound } We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } The ten numbers ? Yeah ? Industrial Designer : Channel , yeah . Project Manager : Uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Volume ? Industrial Designer : Volume control . Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Uh the mute button . Industrial Designer : Well let 's look at your uh design . Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : I h love that one . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . User Interface : I think we we should use something like this um to um { disfmarker } The the channel up and channel down button ? { vocalsound } Yeah , in circle , you know ? Project Manager : Yes . Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . Well that 's that 's also design . User Interface : And and a volume control also in it . Project Manager : Yes . Um { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : { gap } Yeah . Project Manager : Well h ho Industrial Designer : But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a D_V_D_ player or something . So { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes . Yes . They are for some uh video uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yes , as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons . { vocalsound } Marketing : You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance . User Interface : Yeah . I think these should be in one big circle in the middle . Marketing : Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_ was { vocalsound } t kinda true . When { gap } { vocalsound } when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you 're doing the same thing all the time , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : and that 's just what R_S_I_ 's all about . So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . Project Manager : Apart . So people have to move their hand . And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_ . Industrial Designer : Yeah , it 's it 's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . Project Manager : { gap } That 's what I always do , Industrial Designer : Y { gap } Project Manager : because all my i important buttons are the same place . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . It 's good to move uh from time to time . Yeah . Project Manager : Yes ? User Interface : Yeah but people do n't like it when their buttons are all over the place . Marketing : Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well not { disfmarker } User Interface : They they need to be centred . Industrial Designer : No but now y W would we have to choose a way in middle ? Marketing : Frequency of uh button use . Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . You can see . Project Manager : Uh-huh . User Interface : { vocalsound } Volume hardly . Marketing : So the the { vocalsound } channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . User Interface : No I do n't think . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Oh . Project Manager : Up and down far apart from each other ? Industrial Designer : Far apart ? Marketing : { gap } { vocalsound } You thinking uh about R_S_I_ ? User Interface : Yeah but { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well not too much . { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah but { disfmarker } Marketing : Y look at uh look at the frequency . User Interface : No . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : Nei not too much , but { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you do n't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together . Project Manager : Well for example the power button , you can { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : Well they are used four times an hour , so { disfmarker } Project Manager : If someone is constantly z zapping , it 's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . Because I have someone { disfmarker } But the buttons is way . Marketing : Nei nei nei n I I totally agree . Project Manager : So that one can be put away . Marketing : But just { disfmarker } Yeah . Right . Yeah . I agree . Project Manager : The power button can uh be uh uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Power bu button should be left at the top . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yes . Marketing : And should and should be red . Project Manager : Oh man , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : five minutes . { vocalsound } Yeah , well five minutes left . Marketing : Right , just make some decisions . Project Manager : Yep . Marketing : The most important things we have to uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Um how are we going to do it with those numbers ? Industrial Designer : C c can you make you make { disfmarker } We can use uh the drawing board now , I think . Uh it it does n't work well but { disfmarker } But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing . Project Manager : Well I have it here . Yeah well that 's going to take too too much time . Marketing : I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : Mm . Yeah . Marketing : Just uh you decide that , you decide that , Industrial Designer : Mm . Alright . Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : and { vocalsound } ready . Project Manager : Well the L_C_D_ . Um you are Industrial , you are User Interface . So I think it 's going to go to Mike . But you will have to make consensus with { gap } . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } User Interface : Well consensus , um { disfmarker } We we can put it in the middle , so { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well it 's a bit hard , because we are going to be uh individually . Marketing : Nei . We 're { disfmarker } No { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : That 's a bit uh { disfmarker } Marketing : We 're deciding now , so { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : Top or bottom ? Industrial Designer : Well uh yeah I I still think it 's it 's quite important though to uh to have it at the top , so Project Manager : Yes it is . Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } Yeah . You say familiarity is n't important but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well what if we 're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ? Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ? Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah d Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , right . Okay . Project Manager : Alright these functions . User Interface : Alright . Industrial Designer : As we we we we agreed , we do have a L_C_D_ . Project Manager : The number f Well yes , that 's alright . Industrial Designer : So that 's that 's enough . Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , okay . Project Manager : W the number function . Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike 's screen with uh one button that says I 'm going to do a t two number digital ? User Interface : No . Project Manager : How do you want it to do then ? User Interface : Well just when you push a one one and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : There 's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero . Project Manager : It it has to r recognise one as { vocalsound } there could still come more . User Interface : No , { vocalsound } if you { disfmarker } On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , { vocalsound } d it { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Oh , like that . Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : They 'd recognise it . Project Manager : Alright so no button for that . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Th that 's the most { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : That that 's very easy . Yeah . Marketing : No . Project Manager : Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ? Industrial Designer : I think these are the the most important functions . Marketing : Do you still have the pictures over there ? User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , that 's about it . You do need the uh multi Or did uh { disfmarker } No , like this one . You do need them ? Project Manager : No , we 'd uh just said we did n't uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , I know . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : But are we { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Alright , alright uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Now okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um well because we ca n't integrate it with any other uh remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant . So just for a television is that all we need ? Marketing : Right . Yeah , it 's most useable this way . Industrial Designer : { gap } basic function . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Teletext is gone . So all those buttons that { vocalsound } ar are to do with teletext { disfmarker } Oh screen placing . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : We 'll have uh those uh buttons about uh { disfmarker } And uh the two important ones we 're l f forgetting . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh there 's um { vocalsound } screen . You can make it wider and less wide . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video . Marketing : Right . Industrial Designer : Oh yeah . Marketing : I do think we have to put that underneath a clip . Project Manager : Those two ? But it 's just two , and we make a clip ? Industrial Designer : Uh just two just two under uh under uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Th that 's a bit uh waste . User Interface : We we can make { vocalsound } make uh a little row of like four buttons down here . Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : Yeah . Okay , right . Project Manager : Or at the top . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I I think uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go . { vocalsound } User Interface : Or at { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . User Interface : Yeah alright then . Industrial Designer : Uh that 's that 's too complicated . Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : You can just put it somewhere Project Manager : Yeah Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } They they are n't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere { disfmarker } User Interface : Oh , they can be small or round like buttons . Industrial Designer : Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah . Yeah or at the top , yeah . What do you think uh those those buttons ? Project Manager : Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote . Industrial Designer : Above or down ? And w where ? Well we design it later . We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah . Project Manager : Yes ? Yes . Yes . Well any other uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Well if you { vocalsound } you take those th If you { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : Why go to video ? Project Manager : Go to video , that 's always on your remote control . To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ . Marketing : Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : The the video channel uh ? User Interface : That 's just zero . Yeah . Project Manager : Well l n no not at not at my remote . Industrial Designer : No no not always . Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah , but you can can zap down { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ . Project Manager : Yes . I do n't . User Interface : Yes , I think th Project Manager : I go to ninety-nine . { vocalsound } User Interface : No , then you press ninety nine . Marketing : Ah uh well whatever , { vocalsound } . User Interface : I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : Th that 's the button uh { disfmarker } No . Industrial Designer : But it 's easy to go { disfmarker } { vocalsound } If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . Project Manager : No you can ch push zero . Yeah . Yeah , Industrial Designer : It 's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button . Project Manager : I I think that one button is uh { disfmarker } I use it uh { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , but if we 're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new T_V_ . You have to set the channels . Project Manager : Yeah ? Marketing : Right all th these uh different buttons you have to { disfmarker } Project Manager : These buttons , I do n't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote . Industrial Designer : Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk { vocalsound } Marketing : Ah , I do . { vocalsound } Project Manager : It 's it 's incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah well y you must have . Industrial Designer : Yeah y you you you you have screen width . User Interface : Yeah you yeah you have one one button from { vocalsound } s set frequency o or something , Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Right . That 's the only one we put uh in there . Project Manager : So we still { gap } have one uh four ? Marketing : For a screen uh fu uh channel setting . Project Manager : Ch ch Industrial Designer : Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : Programme , right . Project Manager : Okay . Oh the Okay button ? { vocalsound } Marketing : Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . User Interface : Yeah , alright . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Menu button . Industrial Designer : You should { disfmarker } Yeah . I think that 's important . Project Manager : Channel , setting , menu . Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } { gap } And and the settings to change the brightness { vocalsound } Project Manager : { gap } We have to go . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : the settings to change the brightness and the contrast . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Channel , yeah . Project Manager : So um Save . Marketing : { gap } Industrial Designer : Chief ? Chief ? Project Manager : Yes see . Industrial Designer : Th the menu menu button is also important . Project Manager : Yes I have put it in . Industrial Designer : Then you can uh { disfmarker } Where ? { vocalsound } I do n't see it . Project Manager : Here . Industrial Designer : Oh Menu , alright . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah . Industrial Designer : In the menu . And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . User Interface : Yeah , the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Alright . Industrial Designer : Because uh the zapping buttons are n't used then if you are in the menu . User Interface : Or the volume or something like that . Project Manager : Guys ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Or the volume , yeah . Project Manager : We 're going to uh go to our uh rooms , and uh we 'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So { disfmarker } User Interface : Your pen . Marketing : Ah . Great . Industrial Designer : Yes chief . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : Well see you uh { disfmarker } User Interface : I thought we 'd uh lunch uh right now , or not ? Project Manager : W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah this is this is your thing . User Interface : Yeah , lunch break . Marketing : Ah . Okay . { gap } Industrial Designer : I am hungry . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Lunch . Marketing : { vocalsound } Get into my belly . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Ah . We did n't exactly do everything but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } So { disfmarker } User Interface : { gap } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : See you later mate . { vocalsound } 
Query : Summarize the presentation on functional requirements . Marketing : Well , I 'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Um to start with these points . Uh next sheet ? Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it 's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . Uh , furthermore it 's very important what they do like and what they do use . { vocalsound } Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I 'll um show you our target { vocalsound } audience or our target product users , customers . Well , { vocalsound } um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : That 's seventy five per cent of the current users . They do n't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . Um { disfmarker } They also say , that 's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it 's very important that you design a a nice looking control . { vocalsound } Um the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it 's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy . Furthermore , it 's uh { vocalsound } seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } You can zap away . Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , yeah right . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Right . A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their { vocalsound } in their living room . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that 's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : I dunno , maybe that 's an idea . Industrial Designer : Oh . Marketing : 'Cause it 's uh a big { disfmarker } I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Oh ? Project Manager : It should actually uh { disfmarker } It should actually be loose from the television , User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : because it can also be used for other televisions . So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . Marketing : Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ? Project Manager : No you can click it on your television . Marketing : Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah in another room , yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well yes . Marketing : Nee but it it specifically says it 's uh the the control is lost in the same room . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So { disfmarker } Well a beeping device would be { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well we 'll have a look at it , yeah . Marketing : Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it 's it 's too uh too difficult to learn . So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah but people do n't read manuals . Industrial Designer : I did n't read it ? User Interface : No . Industrial Designer : Oh , alright . Marketing : No . Industrial Designer : { gap } users to uh add one ? Do you think ? User Interface : I do n't think { disfmarker } Marketing : I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual . User Interface : Yeah . Yes you should { disfmarker } You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it 's supposed to work . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : Yeah alright . Because they do n't use it ? Alright . Project Manager : Well there sh should always be a menu , Marketing : Yeah . Right . Project Manager : but it c can be very short . Marketing : And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . User Interface : Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think . Project Manager : Yes okay . Industrial Designer : Well maybe for the { disfmarker } If you do n't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I do n't know it ? Marketing : Alright . User Interface : Yeah right . It sh it should be there , the manual . But but not to explain how the remote works . Only { disfmarker } { gap } Marketing : And we do n't have much time . So it 's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than { disfmarker } I think . Project Manager : Well we are a design team , User Interface : Hmm . Project Manager : we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Is n't it part of the of the u Marketing : Yeah right , right . Project Manager : So User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No . No . Never mind . Project Manager : Well we 'll have a look . Um yes ? Marketing : Next point . Um R_S_I_ . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Well that 's about twenty per cent I thought . But uh the designer should uh take it uh { vocalsound } should uh { disfmarker } Wie zeg ik dat ? Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote . Industrial Designer : Consider the m Yeah . Marketing : It should be a good in your hand . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Yep . Marketing : Right , this is the most important part . Um , we 're { disfmarker } Like the requirements said , we 're gon na specify of we 're gon na target a younger audience . Um , { vocalsound } that 's about sixty per cent of the market , so it 's uh quite important . Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . Uh { disfmarker } I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : So it 's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs . Project Manager : Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we ca n't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : It 's going to be expensive . Yeah . User Interface : No . Marketing : Yeah but { vocalsound } they think it 's really important . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : So if we want to s If we have a big { disfmarker } { vocalsound } If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno . We have to uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Well we 'll uh consider it uh . Project Manager : Yeah well uh it 's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : We 'll think abo we 'll think { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , I do n't know . I do n't have any information on that . So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Nigh User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : I know . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No , we 'll look we 'll look into that later . Alright ? Marketing : Right . And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . They also like that , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : but research is very uh costly . So { disfmarker } User Interface : I think that 's uh difficult to realise also . Marketing : Yeah , but { vocalsound } it { vocalsound } it might be important for the sale . Industrial Designer : We have very demanding clients . Project Manager : It 's not yet a standard uh development uh those so { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think . Project Manager : We sh Marketing : Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . Project Manager : Yeah absolutely . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : So we might consider L_C_D_ screens . User Interface : { vocalsound } No . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , alright . Well we 'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : We do n't rule them out uh yet . Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : { gap } 'Kay . Marketing : Alright . Um , I think that 's it . Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Alright . Marketing : I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : So you can { disfmarker } Right . Project Manager : Well you { disfmarker } I c I can uh still see your presentation . Marketing : Yeah . Right . 
Query : What did Project Manager think of the manual design when discussing the ease of use ? Marketing : Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it 's it 's too uh too difficult to learn . So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah but people do n't read manuals . Industrial Designer : I did n't read it ? User Interface : No . Industrial Designer : Oh , alright . Marketing : No . Industrial Designer : { gap } users to uh add one ? Do you think ? User Interface : I do n't think { disfmarker } Marketing : I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual . User Interface : Yeah . Yes you should { disfmarker } You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it 's supposed to work . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : Yeah alright . Because they do n't use it ? Alright . Project Manager : Well there sh should always be a menu , Marketing : Yeah . Right . Project Manager : but it c can be very short . Marketing : And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . User Interface : Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think . Project Manager : Yes okay . Industrial Designer : Well maybe for the { disfmarker } If you do n't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I do n't know it ? Marketing : Alright . User Interface : Yeah right . It sh it should be there , the manual . But but not to explain how the remote works . Only { disfmarker } { gap } Marketing : And we do n't have much time . So it 's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than { disfmarker } I think . Project Manager : Well we are a design team , User Interface : Hmm . Project Manager : we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Is n't it part of the of the u Marketing : Yeah right , right . 
Query : What did the group conclude on LCD screens and the speech recognition suggested by Marketing ? Project Manager : I know . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No , we 'll look we 'll look into that later . Alright ? Marketing : Right . And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . They also like that , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : but research is very uh costly . So { disfmarker } User Interface : I think that 's uh difficult to realise also . Marketing : Yeah , but { vocalsound } it { vocalsound } it might be important for the sale . Industrial Designer : We have very demanding clients .

Marketing : So we might consider L_C_D_ screens . User Interface : { vocalsound } No . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , alright . Well we 'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : We do n't rule them out uh yet . Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : { gap } 'Kay . Marketing : Alright . Um , I think that 's it . Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Alright . Marketing : I think it is sensible to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . Project Manager : Yes . 
Query : Summarize the presentation and discussion about the technical design . Project Manager : It 's in the { disfmarker } Well uh next um I dunno who is next . User Interface : Oh you go . Industrial Designer : Shall I give a technical talk ? Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : Alright . Project Manager : Well go ahead . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design . Project Manager : Yip . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } We have that here . Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the { disfmarker } Project Manager : F_ five . Industrial Designer : F_ F_ five . Project Manager : { vocalsound } F_ five . Industrial Designer : Yep . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well , the working design , Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : that 's my uh { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Next button . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well alright uh , you know who I am and what I do . So uh we have this . It 's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something . It was originally in black and white Marketing : Oh right . Industrial Designer : but it became black and purple . Marketing : Purple { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : But I think you can read it . User Interface : { vocalsound } { gap } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , yeah , yeah . A bit . Industrial Designer : Um well um I think it 's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . Uh well you can see uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Maybe you can select it . So it uh inverts . Industrial Designer : { gap } And I then can select I can select on the dings { gap } It goes to the next page . Marketing : { gap } the p the whole picture . Project Manager : Click . { vocalsound } Marketing : Nah , uh never mind . Industrial Designer : Well , you can read it , User Interface : Yeah , go ahead . Industrial Designer : it 's not too difficult . Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . Marketing : Yeah . Alright . Industrial Designer : And uh the source is of course the user . Uh the user interface is um { vocalsound } uh the { vocalsound } the { gap } the buttons of course . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And the { vocalsound } the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver . That 's the that 's the basic idea . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : Very basic . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Um well I have uh { vocalsound } uh { vocalsound } put it in a in in in a { vocalsound } a couple of basic steps . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed . The key { gap } a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . { vocalsound } uh and recognise the key . So { vocalsound } well you understand . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it 's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the { vocalsound } the signal , and performs the assigned task . Project Manager : So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I 'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that . And a button for T_V_ . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Ah bu Yeah , but we do n't . Uh we { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No no , but { disfmarker } Yeah . Exactly . Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I 've some couple of pictures here . It 's a very basic one . And uh { gap } if we if we 're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it , it uh wo n't look anything like this , but { disfmarker } This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . It has uh very little buttons and { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : But it it uh it 's it 's quite um { disfmarker } Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . They 're uh far enough apart and an anything . It 's not very um uh not very high-tech uh User Interface : High tech . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : indeed , and it 's not very user-friendly . Uh if you look at the shape , it 's uh just a simple long box uh shape . So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing do n't do n't oc do n't occur . Marketing : Right . Can I say something ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . Well teletext is not an option , so that uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : But I think it 's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you ca n't have R_S_I_ uh consequences . Industrial Designer : Yeah , because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately { disfmarker } Marketing : Right . Make them big , make them easy to uh to press . Project Manager : Well but but { vocalsound } User Interface : You can also like { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : You do n't have to look and and search for them . Project Manager : if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves . Marketing : Right . User Interface : Yeah , I was thinking you can { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , right . Right . Project Manager : But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : and that 's on of the things about R_S_I_ . User Interface : Are some of the the the um { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , that 's right . That 's right . That 's right . Industrial Designer : Well you you ca n't have any uh every button { vocalsound } under the thumb , of course . Marketing : We Project Manager : No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ . Marketing : But { disfmarker } Yeah . That 's very important . And { disfmarker } User Interface : Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some Project Manager : Yes I 've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons . Marketing : But is that is that useable ? User Interface : Hmm ? Marketing : Do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : It 's a f it 's a new feature , Project Manager : Well it it 's { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it . User Interface : Yeah alright , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well also i if someone puts { vocalsound } picks up his uh remote { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they 'll understand it { gap } , I think . Project Manager : Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he 's a already on the next channel . User Interface : Eighty per cent would . Industrial Designer : Well , { gap } . Marketing : Yeah , he feels it immediately . Project Manager : That 's very irritating , I think . User Interface : Yeah that 's true . Marketing : Yeah , that 's right . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Right , continue . Industrial Designer : But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . Marketing : Sorry . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I think that 's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they do n't use it uh all the time . Well it 's uh pretty pretty { vocalsound } basically uh as you said . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I do n't want to get too technical , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : because uh that 's not uh very uh useful for you . Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 's your part of the job . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , that 's right . Industrial Designer : So yeah { gap } exactly { gap } this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : And uh well that 's about it I think . Oh yeah , I still have this . Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new { disfmarker } Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . Industrial Designer : But I had too too little time , Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : but uh do n't uh do n't look at it please . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well we understand . Industrial Designer : I I think it 's it 's clear uh how it works . Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : We understand . Marketing : Yeah , it 's clear . Project Manager : Oh right , no . Industrial Designer : Alright . That 's the most important thing . Project Manager : Nice . Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation . Industrial Designer : Alright . Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : How late is did we start his presentation uh ? { gap } Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : { vocalsound } I dunno . I think uh w About twenty minutes ago ? Project Manager : Wha Yeah . Marketing : Losing time losing time . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well then we have still the time , so { disfmarker } { vocalsound } But we do have to come to a decision , right later on . Marketing : Yeah right . So { disfmarker } Project Manager : So { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { gap } User Interface : Well I thought um everybody on the website { vocalsound } uh would see the same thing , but obviously { vocalsound } that 's not the case . Marketing : I do n't think so . Industrial Designer : Yeah , uh there are different uh { disfmarker } We have all have different home pages , with different links . Project Manager : Oh yeah ? User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah right . Project Manager : Uh ? User Interface : For instance you could n't see this . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay , yeah well . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Yeah . Well I 'm Mike { gap } , User Interface Designer . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : The the method ? Well { disfmarker } I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : These are already in use ? User Interface : Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer . Marketing : Alright , okay . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : Well { disfmarker } Project Manager : I like user-centred . Marketing : Yeah , me too . User Interface : I like user-centr centred uh { vocalsound } uh also the best . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . We also do that . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . Marketing : Mm . User Interface : Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . Marketing : But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ? User Interface : But { disfmarker } Yes . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Th that 's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Alright . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we 'll need . Marketing : Yeah , right . User Interface : { vocalsound } I um I kinda like the shape . { vocalsound } I think this is what we talked about . But { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { gap } You ca n't really see uh the differ from different sides . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : But I think uh { disfmarker } User Interface : No I 've { disfmarker } Well I showed it somewhere . Um { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh you can draw it if you { disfmarker } Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Oh yeah . I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : So we can can uh yeah customise the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . So we can not just uh make someone w User Interface : Mm ? { vocalsound } Yeah . { vocalsound } It 's a front . It 's not the the whole remote that changes , of course . Project Manager : No but that 's th the side they look uh look at is the front . User Interface : You can { disfmarker } Marketing : But it { disfmarker } Project Manager : So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone . User Interface : Mm . Marketing : Yeah , that 's right User Interface : Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . Marketing : Yeah , that 's a must . User Interface : So l like Ericsson does { gap } every uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , we must . Industrial Designer : We can put it on the on the back side . Marketing : We must have that . Project Manager : Yeah well and and { disfmarker } User Interface : S something like this . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : It 's recognisable . Project Manager : 'Kay . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : We can make a symbol of the company right here . And { vocalsound } if you put a front on it , there 's a hole on the front . So the symbol 's always on User Interface : Yeah ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , so that you do n't replace the symbol , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah yeah yeah . User Interface : Yeah yeah . Something like that , Project Manager : Or the th the the lowest part of the remote is n't changed by the front . User Interface : in the { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : { disfmarker } Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Those kind of things . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : But let 's not focus on the front { gap } . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes . Okay . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Well so uh uh like I said I thought we 'd we 'd use more function . If we we had to include more functions . But we do n't . So um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Yeah . I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . Marketing : Alright . User Interface : Maybe some less . Like eject we do n't need , and some other buttons we do n't need . I think uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ? User Interface : Yeah , I will . I think uh for the remote um uh less is more . { vocalsound } The less buttons the better the design . Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : We should go with that concept I think . Marketing : Yeah , I agree . User Interface : I know . Project Manager : Alright . Marketing : I 've I 've got another point . Project Manager : Yeah ? Marketing : Um there are two target audi audiences , and we 've uh chose for the younger one . User Interface : Mm . Marketing : Um , research has shown that um it 's a high interested uh in features . They are high high interested in feature . But they are more critical . Fo Yeah , critical . Industrial Designer : The younger uh { disfmarker } Marketing : So { disfmarker } The younger audience . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people . Project Manager : Well what if we um { disfmarker } I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : a f a little uh { disfmarker } You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people do n't use but s some do do . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh { vocalsound } uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Clip are n't used much . Project Manager : Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot , Industrial Designer : No um mm usually { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah right . Industrial Designer : But { disfmarker } Project Manager : but not { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah , but what kind of features ? Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . Industrial Designer : Yeah I think { vocalsound } m most { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah but { disfmarker } Yeah . User Interface : But I 've { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Most uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Here , look at these numbers . The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control . Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Uh . Marketing : You see ? So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Competitors . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Our competitor . Yeah . Marketing : The concurrent ? { vocalsound } Competitors , right . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } So , I do think we have to uh have some features . Project Manager : Yeah . Well maybe w we could uh s Marketing : Even though they cost a little more . Project Manager : On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , Marketing : Right . Right . Project Manager : or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . And if if that 's gives you a little bit of sta status information . Marketing : Like a ticker-tape . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Which programme you are l watching or something . User Interface : Yeah , that 's nice . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s . And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you 're currently watching . Marketing : Yeah , right . Yeah right . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen . { vocalsound } Project Manager : For example . It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . User Interface : Yeah , we should keep that simple too . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : It will { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well maybe . Marketing : No not clickable . User Interface : No , it should be uh integrated . Industrial Designer : or { vocalsound } or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . { vocalsound } Marketing : Nah , no no no . User Interface : I think { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , just at at the top . So when you s { vocalsound } you sit like this you can can watch . Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah , Marketing : I think it should be at the top . User Interface : something like on um some radios in car . You { disfmarker } Where it 's , yeah , walking to { disfmarker } Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah right . It 's a ticker-tape idea . Project Manager : R_D_S_s or something . Industrial Designer : But that 's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and { vocalsound } that kind of thing . User Interface : Wa Yeah . Project Manager : Well I think it 's you got { disfmarker } It just means it 's a script that 's uh keeps it uh rolling , Marketing : Well it 's just one script . { vocalsound } Project Manager : and it 's not uh { disfmarker } That 's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : So I do n't think that 's the issue . Project Manager : No . Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? Project Manager : Uh well I think so , yes . Um { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost . Marketing : 'Kay . Right , I do n't know if I can find that , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : We 're g No but we 're we 'll have to look into that . User Interface : Or maybe you will get that information uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Um we can use this board again , I think . Marketing : Next time . Yeah right . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue . { vocalsound } Where is my presentation ? { vocalsound } Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , I understand what you 're saying . Project Manager : { gap } Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : We should have a general idea of how it 's gon na look . Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } I mean we 're all here now , I think . These I 've already given you . So we have to decide on the different remote control functions . So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that 's special . Marketing : Right . At the top . Industrial Designer : Should n't we start with the most important parts ? Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : At the top or at the bottom ? Industrial Designer : The L_C_D_ screen alright { gap } but we should start with the power button ? Marketing : I think the top is more uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah but { disfmarker } Marketing : When you s How do you zap ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : You just sit in your chair ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Huh ? User Interface : Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . Marketing : With the remote ? Project Manager : That thing is terrible . User Interface : 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah but that 's where your hand ball might be . Project Manager : Uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah , no Mm . Marketing : Yeah , I dunno . Industrial Designer : And then uh { disfmarker } Marketing : We 'll draw two , and then we 'll see uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . { vocalsound } I dunno what uh you were talking about but { disfmarker } Marketing : No { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { gap } we are busy with something { gap } . Marketing : Um he thinks { disfmarker } Yeah , right . He thinks it 's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it 's better at the top . Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . Why do you think it 's better at the bottom ? User Interface : Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . Marketing : But your { disfmarker } User Interface : I c Industrial Designer : But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there 's room for the for the interface . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Well I d I think that 's that 's ugly but { disfmarker } Marketing : The the ticker { disfmarker } The L_C_D_ is like like small . { vocalsound } It 's it 's wide . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . Marketing : It 's not not high . But { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , User Interface : { vocalsound } I th Industrial Designer : And and we can { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . User Interface : Yeah . Power button always { disfmarker } Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Bottom . Project Manager : So and and I I like to use the ones on the top . User Interface : Yeah , y you got ta zap like this or { vocalsound } you want to { disfmarker } Yeah . Project Manager : So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah right . But { disfmarker } We 're making a remote with { vocalsound } with a few functions you know . Industrial Designer : Well { vocalsound } that 's { vocalsound } a bit exaggerated . Well , I agree with you { gap } . It 's it 's also more recognisable . Marketing : We Industrial Designer : It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the the thing on top . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes but we we we we do n't want that . User Interface : Yeah you do n't want { disfmarker } Project Manager : We do n't want them to look like a calculator . User Interface : You want uh { disfmarker } Yeah it it it must be a remote . Project Manager : We want to look it like our original but familiar { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah w well , User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : but uh you do n't have to throw uh um important aspe { vocalsound } important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , Marketing : High-tech { gap } . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yea Industrial Designer : uh because { vocalsound } I think it 's uh { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } We White ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I think it 's still important to have it at the top , Marketing : Width . Project Manager : Width . Uh format yeah format ? Line width ? Width ? Industrial Designer : because it 's uh it 's more familiar that way . Marketing : { gap } Th that 's not a problem . Project Manager : Yeah ? Marketing : { vocalsound } When I draw here it User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { disfmarker } Oh . Huh ? Project Manager : It 's a bit off . Marketing : Yeah , it 's off . Project Manager : Well . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } A little a little bit . Marketing : { vocalsound } It { vocalsound } it needs to be calibrated again . Well { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well uh let 's uh talk about that later uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Maybe you should another pen . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Maybe that 's uh better . { gap } You e you only have one pen for that screen . Yeah . Marketing : Where ? Project Manager : It 's special pen . Marketing : { vocalsound } Alright , we have to make a decision now , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : because we do n't have much time . Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : No . Marketing : I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . Industrial Designer : Yeah . I I agree . Project Manager : I think it should be at the button , bottom . Bottom . The L_C_D_ . User Interface : At the bottom ? Industrial Designer : Well I 'm the { vocalsound } I I 'm the designer , so um { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } In a few minutes { disfmarker } Marketing : At the bot User Interface : Oh yeah , oh yeah , I totally agree . Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : So { disfmarker } We are two uh V_S_ two . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , User Interface : { vocalsound } He 's the boss . { vocalsound } Project Manager : and then look at the design . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Right . Great . Industrial Designer : Uh we uh we were busy with that . Project Manager : Because we have to decide this . Industrial Designer : Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So , we have the power button . Marketing : And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s . Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : It 's uh your it 's your job . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well we have a power button . Industrial Designer : Yeah of course . Uh it 's uh . Yeah . W wh User Interface : No it 's our job . Project Manager : Guys ? User Interface : For all of us I think . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : While you have to agree , I can say { gap } it 's like this and { vocalsound } you must agree . Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , right . Project Manager : Guys ? Marketing : Alright , let 's keep it central . Project Manager : { vocalsound } We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } The ten numbers ? Yeah ? Industrial Designer : Channel , yeah . Project Manager : Uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Volume ? Industrial Designer : Volume control . Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Uh the mute button . 
Query : Why did User Interface think they should use more buttons than the current one when discussing the technical function design ? Marketing : These are already in use ? User Interface : Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer . Marketing : Alright , okay . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : Well { disfmarker } Project Manager : I like user-centred . Marketing : Yeah , me too . User Interface : I like user-centr centred uh { vocalsound } uh also the best . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . We also do that . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . Marketing : Mm . User Interface : Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . Marketing : But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ? User Interface : But { disfmarker } Yes . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Th that 's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Alright . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we 'll need . Marketing : Yeah , right . 
Query : What did the group think of the pros and cons of having an LCD screen on top of the remote ? Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } I mean we 're all here now , I think . These I 've already given you . So we have to decide on the different remote control functions . So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that 's special . Marketing : Right . At the top . Industrial Designer : Should n't we start with the most important parts ? Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : At the top or at the bottom ? Industrial Designer : The L_C_D_ screen alright { gap } but we should start with the power button ? Marketing : I think the top is more uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah but { disfmarker } Marketing : When you s How do you zap ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : You just sit in your chair ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Huh ? User Interface : Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . Marketing : With the remote ? Project Manager : That thing is terrible . User Interface : 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah but that 's where your hand ball might be . Project Manager : Uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah , no Mm . Marketing : Yeah , I dunno . Industrial Designer : And then uh { disfmarker } Marketing : We 'll draw two , and then we 'll see uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . { vocalsound } I dunno what uh you were talking about but { disfmarker } Marketing : No { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { gap } we are busy with something { gap } . Marketing : Um he thinks { disfmarker } Yeah , right . He thinks it 's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it 's better at the top . Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . Why do you think it 's better at the bottom ? User Interface : Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . Marketing : But your { disfmarker } User Interface : I c Industrial Designer : But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there 's room for the for the interface . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Well I d I think that 's that 's ugly but { disfmarker } Marketing : The the ticker { disfmarker } The L_C_D_ is like like small . { vocalsound } It 's it 's wide . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . Marketing : It 's not not high . But { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , User Interface : { vocalsound } I th Industrial Designer : And and we can { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . User Interface : Yeah . Power button always { disfmarker } Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Bottom . Project Manager : So and and I I like to use the ones on the top . User Interface : Yeah , y you got ta zap like this or { vocalsound } you want to { disfmarker } Yeah . Project Manager : So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah right . But { disfmarker } We 're making a remote with { vocalsound } with a few functions you know . Industrial Designer : Well { vocalsound } that 's { vocalsound } a bit exaggerated . Well , I agree with you { gap } . It 's it 's also more recognisable . Marketing : We 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I 'm proud of it . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . And again I 'll take minutes . The { disfmarker } what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you 've been working on so diligently . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : It does look very cool . Project Manager : Um then Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } then Cat 's going to present the evaluation criteria that we 're going to be evaluating this against . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it 's within the finance criteria . Um and then we 'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we 've been through . So we 've got forty minutes . S Marketing : And then do we get to make a remote control ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } 'Cause we missed out . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : So Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : it 's now { disfmarker } I guess that we 're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we 've got until four fifteen . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ? Project Manager : Is that right ? User Interface : Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : until about four fifteen . So yeah . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay , so . Project Manager : Go for it . Do you want { disfmarker } User Interface : So , you said um { disfmarker } are are we starting with the the { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : Presentation . User Interface : so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Okay . { vocalsound } Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and { vocalsound } { disfmarker } we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Um { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : It 's a bit um phallic . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Well , but it 's it 's just an a approximation . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Dual use , perfect . Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Dual use , perfect . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Oh , { vocalsound } { gap } your remote control ? Oh that 's just bad . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Um so basically it 's the it 's the flip open thing again . Project Manager : Sorry , sorry . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : So now we we have the { disfmarker } okay , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Wow . Industrial Designer : and uh { vocalsound } the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : And it 's { disfmarker } the whole thing 's made of rubber , is that { disfmarker } User Interface : Uh yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah . User Interface : Rubber . Marketing : Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? User Interface : Yeah , { gap } . Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be { gap } and { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , User Interface : so we said the back side round , yeah . Industrial Designer : well , but i since it 's made of rubber anyway . I I think it 's it 's uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : It l does look like the { gap } curvy User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : and then the whole shape 's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Hmm . User Interface : Yeah . And it 's spongy as well . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } I was n't very keen on that , but yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : So { vocalsound } so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the { vocalsound } on the cover we just have the very basic things . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Huh . Mm-hmm . User Interface : So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three { disfmarker } there would be numbers in in the { disfmarker } on the actual one . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : So it 's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Six seven eight nine . I like that . User Interface : Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It 's it 's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it 's it 's kind of user friendly . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and { disfmarker } like the previous one and the next one . Project Manager : Uh-huh . User Interface : And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . Marketing : So where 's the volume ? Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : The volume is is scrolling . Industrial Designer : It 's on the side . User Interface : On the side , Marketing : Ah , you did get that in then , User Interface : this one . Yeah you just do it like this . Marketing : mm-hmm . User Interface : And and and it 's it 's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . Marketing : Oh okay , { gap } . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : See ? So the volume is { vocalsound } you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , { vocalsound } okay , there there you have the screen Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : and and you have the mm { vocalsound } spinning wheel with options to choose . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Uh no , we we 'd not put { gap } { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : A mute button . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials . User Interface : Well , { gap } we 'll have this on the screen , on the display . Project Manager : Y or you could have it { disfmarker } so you { disfmarker } on the wheel if you { disfmarker } Marketing : On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . Industrial Designer : Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . User Interface : Well , but the but the mute { disfmarker } yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? Project Manager : But if you hold it in , Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Yeah , but it 's a scroll and click , is n't it ? Project Manager : if it 's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? Marketing : Okay , cool . User Interface : Okay , yeah , okay . Marketing : So that { gap } that solves the whole mute issue . Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : Yeah . { vocalsound } And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . Project Manager : { gap } no . User Interface : You ca n't really see it in the interface . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , it 's hidden in there somewhere . User Interface : Yeah . And we do have the logo on it as well . Project Manager : Mm-hmm , very good . User Interface : So I think it { disfmarker } Project Manager : And it 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } with the the black and yellow you 're even in the right colours . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : { gap } . Industrial Designer : Cool . User Interface : Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } We ran out of resources here , so . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : In the actual one . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : You can have a look . { vocalsound } User Interface : So if you have questions . Project Manager : Very good , let 's have a look . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Test it out . { vocalsound } Marketing : { gap } . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh it 's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess . Marketing : Yeah , oh , we hold the remote . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : I hate Play-Do , it 's just minging . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : But yeah , uh that 's cool , cool . Project Manager : Very good . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : and then we 'll there { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , see the budget . Project Manager : I suspect we 're gon na have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we 'll se I 'm sure we can get around them somehow . Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : We 'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : and cut some of the prices that way . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Wales . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Wales , for example . { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Fabulous , Project Manager : Marketing Expert . Marketing : yeah . Okay , cool . So what we 're gon na do is prefer { disfmarker } prepare the evaluation of the new design . { vocalsound } Um so we 're gon na be using a seven point scale , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really does n't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we 've done and we 've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like { disfmarker } so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Okay ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Cool , so these are what they are . Oh { disfmarker } Project Manager : So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ? Marketing : Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . Project Manager : Mm dots , never mind . Marketing : Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } I guess we 'll give it maximum points in everything . { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah , the yeah , it 's definitely attractive . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , I agree . User Interface : Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot . Marketing : Well , I thought we 'd um kinda said that you 'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? Project Manager : Yeah , just prepare one now . User Interface : Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . User Interface : It will be red , too . Marketing : Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at . That 's this one . What do you all say ? Industrial Designer : So ? Project Manager : I reckon it { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : I I go for seven . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yes . Marketing : Oh { vocalsound } we 're all so proud of the { gap } . Project Manager : Seven , yeah , it 's terribly sexy . Yeah . Marketing : Okay , so that 'll be a seven for A_ . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Could { disfmarker } oh no , you ca n't whilst that 's up there . Okay um uh what I 've done on the next page is I 've set it up so we just put the marks in . Project Manager : Ah , okay . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : Excellent . Except we ca n't { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : But we can we can { disfmarker } Marketing : But that 's alright . Project Manager : uh we can if we { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I can I can take note uh uh { disfmarker } Marketing : If you take a note of them , and then I 'll put them in in a minute . Project Manager : then yeah , I 'll take a note , it 's fine . Marketing : Okay , so { vocalsound } we 're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? Industrial Designer : Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , Project Manager : I think it does . User Interface : I would think yes , yeah . Marketing : Yeah . I mean { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so if you 're left-handed you 're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . User Interface : Yeah , Project Manager : Alright . User Interface : so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m { vocalsound } model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : But that 's gon na be a problem , Industrial Designer : But then { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : 'cause you do n't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So bu it 's it 's not a huge problem , Marketing : I th I think it 's not { vocalsound } it 's not like it 's a pen . Industrial Designer : because i i it is operatable . User Interface : But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : so they just { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , but I mean because it 's not like it 's a pen , you know , left-handed people ca n't normally write right-handed , User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : but they can normally do most things right-handed , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : so I would say it 's not such a big issue . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : so i if the majority are right-handed , it 's uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yep . Marketing : So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : So maybe we need to put { disfmarker } that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? Project Manager : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : What do you what do you all think ? Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Six . User Interface : Or maybe six , because it 's just one one i one among the issues , Project Manager : Yeah , I think I think for um { disfmarker } User Interface : I mean . Yeah . Project Manager : I mean most people are right-handed , so in { vocalsound } in terms of our greatest target group , I think it 's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want { disfmarker } might want to um { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : One more thing is that i Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , Project Manager : They { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so it opens on the side . So { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : No , yeah , but mm but we have it { vocalsound } nicely { vocalsound } with the hinges here { gap } yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah yeah yeah , I mean { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : So it wo n't be a problem , Marketing : Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : So you guys can decide wh whether { disfmarker } User Interface : it will be { disfmarker } and it will be { disfmarker } it wo n't be heavy . Industrial Designer : Oops . Marketing : I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top . Industrial Designer : Yeah , but we { disfmarker } which makes it kind of really big , yeah . User Interface : Yeah well yeah , Project Manager : The length is gon na be difficu User Interface : but it 's it 's a bit long . It 's a little bit long . Marketing : Yeah um { disfmarker } User Interface : Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah . Marketing : But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Uh this this kind of uh makes it more { gap } Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Because { disfmarker } User Interface : S uh slightly smaller . Industrial Designer : and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel . Marketing : So you have to keep that side flat . User Interface : Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side 's flat , than that will work . Industrial Designer : Right . Okay . Marketing : Okay . Um { vocalsound } okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we 're gon na stick a locator on the T_V_ ? Industrial Designer : No , we have a locator . Project Manager : No , we 're gon na put it like { disfmarker } we 've got th there 's the locator dot . Marketing : There 's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a { disfmarker } that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , User Interface : Mm that you stick on T_V_ . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : does n't it ? To make it beep . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Or a buzzer . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some { disfmarker } to make some sounds , so { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : So that 's two , so that 's seven , yeah . It 's locatable ? User Interface : Yep . Marketing : Fabulous . D_ . Industrial Designer : Intuitive , completely intuitive . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . If { vocalsound } uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : and it 's { disfmarker } I th I think it 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : I 'd say six , 'cause the { disfmarker } I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you 've got it . I really like the way you have it , Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : but it 's not the immediate thing that you 're used to . Industrial Designer : Intuitive . Marketing : Yeah , and I mean d Industrial Designer : And uh even the scroll , it 's a it 's a new technology Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni Project Manager : Might be { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it 's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it . Project Manager : But it { disfmarker } and it 's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : So , should we maybe say f a five Industrial Designer : So l Marketing : and say it is intuitive , Project Manager : Five ? Marketing : but it 's different , so , do you know , I mean it 's obvious how to use it , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay . I 'm gon na give a seven in everything , so . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yep . Project Manager : I 'm happy with five ? User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : I 'm glad you 're accepting this . It has taken a little while , has n't it ? Um intuitive but { disfmarker } Sorry , it 's really hard to write on those . Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } Marketing : I just went a bit mad , did n't I ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Um okay , cool , E_ , okay . Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . Investigate . Project Manager : Yep . But otherwise it 's superb . Marketing : So , should we give it a six ? Project Manager : Six . Marketing : Six ? User Interface : Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , Industrial Designer : { gap } . User Interface : but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting . User Interface : yeah ? See . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah , so it 's kinda { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic . Marketing : I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , Project Manager : Well we 've banned them from { disfmarker } Marketing : and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm yeah . Marketing : so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest . Industrial Designer : And moreover it it has um { vocalsound } L_C_D_ and everything , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , it 's varied . Marketing : Okay , so we give that a six , Project Manager : Yeah . Six ? Marketing : yeah . Okay , F_ . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah , { gap } { disfmarker } it does have { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Absolutely . Project Manager : Voice control have seven . Marketing : Hang on , how come it 's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That 's just { disfmarker } Project Manager : Ah , that 's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it 's got score , but not on the previous slide . Marketing : Oh okay , cool . Um { vocalsound } right , so { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : So it has voice control . Marketing : Yes , so that 's a seven then . Industrial Designer : Yep . Marketing : Um , cool . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : G_ technologically innovative . Industrial Designer : Anyway it ha yeah , User Interface : Technologi { gap } well { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : it 's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . User Interface : Yeah . Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is { disfmarker } yeah , it 's kind of new . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , but I mean you do n't { disfmarker } Project Manager : All of the components have been used in other things before . Industrial Designer : Yeah , but they 've been brought together in a remote . User Interface : But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . Marketing : They 're never been used i they 've never been using remote remote control before I do n't think . Project Manager : But do { disfmarker } yeah , yeah . Yeah . Marketing : { gap } . Project Manager : What do you reckon , five , six ? Marketing : Yeah , what do you all think ? User Interface : Six . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : Six ? User Interface : I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Well , that 's it , I mean { disfmarker } User Interface : It still has to do what i what it has to do . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , has n't it ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : So , I do n't think many peop Project Manager : Space remote . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : That 's it , they can take it with them . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Put fashion in electronics . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Absolutely . { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah , is n't it fashionable ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : The carrot banana remote . { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah , sure . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : It 's the maximum fashion . Marketing : So , we give it seven , and we write { disfmarker } User Interface : Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : There we go . Industrial Designer : I think that 's a { gap } . User Interface : So I think we 've done very well , but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Cool . Project Manager : Very good . User Interface : { vocalsound } What 's the assessment ? Marketing : So , we need the average here , so we got { disfmarker } User Interface : The average is about six and something . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , one . User Interface : A little bit over six . Marketing : Seven { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } There are how many sixes ? Project Manager : Or a seven { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : One , two , three . Marketing : So we 've got four sevens , User Interface : No , wait , a little bit under six . Marketing : so that 's twenty eight , Industrial Designer : Three . User Interface : No , wait . Marketing : three sixes , Industrial Designer : And one five . Marketing : eighteen . User Interface : Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . Industrial Designer : Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one . Project Manager : Six point point { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Fifty one divided by { disfmarker } User Interface : Six point something , yeah . Marketing : Two three four { disfmarker } Seven eight . Project Manager : about six point five . User Interface : { vocalsound } Six point five , yeah . Project Manager : Close enough . Marketing : Okay , that 's pretty good , I think . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Now wait until we { vocalsound } get to finance and then we 'll see if we can afford it . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : That 's all you 've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ? Marketing : Um no , that 's it , Project Manager : That 's it ? Marketing : yeah . Project Manager : Alright . So , finance . And we 'll see if we can unscrew this first . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Cool , there we go . Project Manager : Sorry , this is { disfmarker } I 'm just um { disfmarker } Marketing : { gap } . There we go and there are the marks . Project Manager : Beautiful . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Not anymore . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Computer no signal ? Industrial Designer : Mm I guess it 'll have to wait for a bit . Project Manager : Adjusting . There we go . Okay , so we 've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . And now we have to calculate the production costs . So I 've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . Can you read that ? Almost . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : More or less . Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . No hand dynamo , right ? Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : One simple battery . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : No kinetic energy , no solar . The chip , we 're going for an advanced chip on print . Industrial Designer : Advanced , yeah . Project Manager : We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . User Interface : Yep . Project Manager : Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . User Interface : Yeah , yes . Project Manager : Case material we said rubber . User Interface : Rubber . Industrial Designer : Yep . Project Manager : I do n't know what special colour means . Industrial Designer : Mm anything uh I think which is not more { gap } . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : I think something coloured , yeah , probably . So I think this is probably special co no ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : It could be { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , does n't it ? You know . Project Manager : Rub rubber comes coloured , User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : it 's { disfmarker } I would { disfmarker } { vocalsound } maybe it 's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it 's different . User Interface : Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , Project Manager : Yeah , let 's leave it as zero , 'cause it 's easy . { vocalsound } User Interface : { gap } yeah yeah , okay . Marketing : Yeah , User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . Project Manager : We we 're definitely going to have to { disfmarker } User Interface : We have pushbuttons , Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : so we 've got pushbutton , and then we 've User Interface : scro we have scroll wheel as well . Project Manager : Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? Industrial Designer : No uh we we have uh yeah . User Interface : S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : And we have L_C_ display Project Manager : And button supplements . User Interface : and { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm no . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : { gap } . No . Industrial Designer : We do n't have { disfmarker } Project Manager : No . No ? Industrial Designer : we 're not using any of that . User Interface : Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel { disfmarker } Project Manager : But the the spinning wheel 's not there . I have { disfmarker } think { disfmarker } maybe it 's integrated with the L_C_ display ? User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : We 've got more than one pushbutton though , User Interface : Okay , let 's { gap } yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : have n't we ? Project Manager : I think the pushbutton { disfmarker } oh . Marketing : 'Cause then you have { disfmarker } Project Manager : I do n't know if that 's one { disfmarker } Marketing : That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total does n't it ? Not counting anything , we 'd still be in budget . Project Manager : Yeah . That seems unlikely . Industrial Designer : Huh ? Project Manager : Push what uh Industrial Designer : Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh . Marketing : Twelve point five . Project Manager : whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we { disfmarker } User Interface : We have to count all of them , or { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm I do n't think so , no . Project Manager : I do n't think that makes sense . Marketing : No . Industrial Designer : No it says what what is the kind of interface , Marketing : Well it does n't , but it uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : No . Industrial Designer : if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it 's a scroll wheel { disfmarker } so we we 've put it 's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : And L_C_ display . Industrial Designer : so that 's that 's the three kind of interfaces that we have . Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . So , as we can see , that 's way too expensive down here . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Wh wh what 's our criteria ? Marketing : This sample sensor { gap } . Project Manager : Our budget 's twelve point five . Industrial Designer : Uh okay . Marketing : Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that 's the most expensive thing on there . Project Manager : Yeah , so that has implications though for the { gap } . Industrial Designer : Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . { gap } when you say { disfmarker } when you press one it says one or it says hello . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : For the locator . Marketing : But that 's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , is n't it ? Industrial Designer : Mm { vocalsound } and the locator also goes away . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : We can afford to get rid of it . User Interface : But it was very no innovative Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : So that means no locator , does it ? User Interface : { gap } innovativeness { gap } . Well um { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : I mean does { disfmarker } Project Manager : What else does it need ? User Interface : Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . Project Manager : Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . User Interface : This would be { disfmarker } Yeah , yeah yeah { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : there you record your samples your speech samples and { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , okay , so we { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : A also i in the case I 'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it 's just rubber , so it 's probably a flat surface rubber . Uh I mean uh um { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : Uh-huh . Marketing : Okay , yeah . Industrial Designer : Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Right , so we need one fifty off . Marketing : See , I was gon na say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause { disfmarker } Project Manager : Take it down to just a scroll wheel . { vocalsound } We could do { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : So tha that { vocalsound } mean that we can not press { disfmarker } how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ? User Interface : Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . Industrial Designer : If { vocalsound } in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d can not push the button . User Interface : Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we do n't have a pushbutton uh we ca we do n't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . Marketing : But that 's { disfmarker } well you would just have to to spin it down { gap } . Project Manager : Yeah . You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : No w w w but ha Marketing : So that 's point three . Industrial Designer : it 's it 's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . User Interface : But I mean { vocalsound } we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . Marketing : Yeah , User Interface : If you { disfmarker } Marketing : I mean that would n't actually cost any more . That 's the spin wheel though , is n't it ? Did n't that come with the L_C_ { disfmarker } Project Manager : That 's with the L_C_ Industrial Designer : That comes with the L_C_D_ ? Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : We decided , 'cause it 's not on our list . Industrial Designer : Oh so so the the this is { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : The scroll wheel is on the side . Industrial Designer : { gap } . So { vocalsound } we 're adding costs for { gap } right , okay uh I mean I think this is good . Marketing : S so we 're point three over . User Interface : So { disfmarker } Project Manager : We 're point three over at the moment . Marketing : Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether Project Manager : It 's nothing n Marketing : and just have pushbuttons for the volume . Could b still put them on the side . But yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , Marketing : I mean the scroll wheel 's pretty cool , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : I have { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up { disfmarker } for up and down . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : On the side . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Okay , yeah . Project Manager : Rather than having three different things that people have to do . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { gap } . User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : There we go . Oh look , we 're way under budget and we 'll make huge profits and we 'll all get bonuses . Marketing : Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve { gap } , could n't we ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . Marketing : Yeah , but { gap } { disfmarker } Project Manager : So that 's alright . We we 'll leave it at that { gap } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : and then I 'll take { disfmarker } I can send it back to management and say we were n't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we 've still got some space for it , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } We have , yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Excellent . Alright . So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? Marketing : No . Industrial Designer : Not really , no . Marketing : No , I do n't think so . Industrial Designer : Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : We { disfmarker } instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : We just got rid of a gimmick that was never { gap } anyway , Industrial Designer : Um yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was { disfmarker } it 's not a great difference I do n't think . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } But we lose the locator . Project Manager : Alright then . Marketing : Really ? Project Manager : We 're gon na have a beep . User Interface : { vocalsound } Well { gap } we 're going to have a beeping thing . Industrial Designer : So instead of speaker , { gap } . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : But yeah , it 's it 's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : 'Kay . { vocalsound } Marketing : Cool . That 's not a very exciting colour . I think you should make it more vegetable-like . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Tha User Interface : Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Oh the the beeper thing . Project Manager : { gap } . Marketing : It { disfmarker } User Interface : But it can be yellow as well . It can come in the same colour as the the case . Project Manager : 'Cause we we wo n't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh { gap } . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : You know , your pen vibrates ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : But only for a very short time . Um okay . So looks like we 've designed a banana . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well done , team . { vocalsound } Um we need { disfmarker } we 've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they 're designing a product . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I think it mm { disfmarker } Marketing : Cool . Project Manager : Feedback ? Ideas ? User Interface : Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Um we kap kept a adding things randomly . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So , had we known { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : If we 'd had that sheet at the beginning { gap } should 've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let 's just throw it together and do what we can . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , that or not , yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . So { vocalsound } d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } Project Manager : But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . Industrial Designer : Yeah , mm . Marketing : I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . It was n't like we were alone for very long , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : so you did n't { vocalsound } st go off and think , would n't it be great to have a vibrating { vocalsound } remote control { vocalsound } shaped like a banana , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Banana . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen 's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Um yeah , so yeah . User Interface : Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used . Project Manager : Mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens . User Interface : And the pens . { vocalsound } Marketing : Uh I like the pens . Project Manager : { vocalsound } We like the pens . { vocalsound } Marketing : I want one . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s Project Manager : Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah yeah , Project Manager : and have it printed out when you got back to the office . User Interface : Yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : that 's it 's it 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : They great ? Industrial Designer : I wonder what one of these costs . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Do you think they 'd notice if one went ? Marketing : { vocalsound } I do n't think you should say that was the recording . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Oh okay . Marketing : Okay , cover up the microphone . Alright , let 's take it . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yep . Shh . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yep . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the { disfmarker } I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it 's so static and you ca n't change it once you 're in there , Marketing : It is a bit limiting , is n't it ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : yep . User Interface : Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . The thing flew in , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : you did n't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there was n't time for that , so yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . That 's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah . Marketing : Not that you can do that on the board , either . We could make some little { disfmarker } User Interface : But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . Marketing : Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , I mean especially with that last-minute alteration . Project Manager : Mm . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : { gap } back it , { vocalsound } this is { disfmarker } just had to be changed User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : . And { disfmarker } yeah , so { disfmarker } cool . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : And presumably you do n't { disfmarker } you can say nasty things as well . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : I have no stake in it . User Interface : I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah . Marketing : Yeah , definitely . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : You were n't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good . Project Manager : You have to say that , 'cause I 'm taking the notes . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : I 'll leave the room and you can have another go . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : I know you 've got the pen , you might attack me with it . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Better than that than the banana . User Interface : And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah . Project Manager : I think it worked quite well . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? User Interface : To express them mm mm Industrial Designer : Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group , User Interface : no . Industrial Designer : so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { gap } . New ideas found . Not quite sure what about . User Interface : Well it 's it 's it 's pretty new , Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : I do n't know , I do n't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody 's already though of it . User Interface : Yeah , neither neither do I , Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : but I 've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Yeah . I 'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay . Project Manager : Yeah , that 's right . { vocalsound } Marketing : That looks boring , I 'll see if anyone 's made a { gap } remote control . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . Marketing : Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : Patent patent patent . Mm . Marketing : I think we 'd like to think the ideas were new , Project Manager : Banana remote . Marketing : but we 've got no way of finding out . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : That vibrates { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Flip . Vibrate User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really would n't it . Project Manager : . And uh { disfmarker } yeah . { vocalsound } Nothing that you really want . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : True . Yeah . { vocalsound } Okay . So , costs are within budget , Marketing : Yes . User Interface : Yes . { vocalsound } Project Manager : well within budget , including a little { disfmarker } what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we did n't foresee . Um we 've evaluated the project . User Interface : Yes . Marketing : And it 's fabulous . Project Manager : You 've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ? Marketing : It 's in the project documents { gap } . Project Manager : It 's in there already . And the process wheel did n't really have any major problems with . Were there any { disfmarker } was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that did n't go as smoothly as you 'd hope ? User Interface : And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Otherwise it 's it 's all fine . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Yeah , yeah , sometimes it 's like a little bit rushed . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I thought that was good though , because if you 're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um { disfmarker } yeah . User Interface : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay then . Um I think we 're still well within our time . Marketing : Yeah , we 've got like five minutes left . Project Manager : We 've got about five minutes left , but if we 've finished , then we 've finished . We 're just too too efficient User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } We certainly are , Project Manager : and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : mm . Yeah . User Interface : Yes . Project Manager : So I would say that 's the end of that meeting . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : 'Kay . Project Manager : Thank you , team . User Interface : Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , same here . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : It was very productive day and { disfmarker } Marketing : We could draw animals on the board again . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Mm uh no . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm uh no . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I do n't think so . { vocalsound } User Interface : You can make some animals . Marketing : I do n't like Play-Doh , no . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Oh , you do n't like anim Marketing : It 's just minging . It smells so bad . User Interface : { vocalsound } It does n't ? Marketing : It does . User Interface : Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . Industrial Designer : Was there a questionnaire already sent ? Project Manager : I do n't know if it 's already sent or not . Marketing : No , it has n't been . Project Manager : Um presumably I have to { disfmarker } Marketing : Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? Project Manager : I do n't see why you ca n't stay here , really . Marketing : Okay , so the other way . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Did I save this one ? Production costs . User Interface : { vocalsound } I made your animal for you . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } It was supposed to be pink . { vocalsound } But it was blue on the board . User Interface : Yeah , that 's the one { disfmarker } 
Query : Summarize the presentation on evaluation criteria . Project Manager : Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : and then we 'll there { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , see the budget . Project Manager : I suspect we 're gon na have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we 'll se I 'm sure we can get around them somehow . Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : We 'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : and cut some of the prices that way . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Wales . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Wales , for example . { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Fabulous , Project Manager : Marketing Expert . Marketing : yeah . Okay , cool . So what we 're gon na do is prefer { disfmarker } prepare the evaluation of the new design . { vocalsound } Um so we 're gon na be using a seven point scale , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really does n't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we 've done and we 've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like { disfmarker } so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Okay ? Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Cool , so these are what they are . Oh { disfmarker } Project Manager : So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ? Marketing : Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . Project Manager : Mm dots , never mind . Marketing : Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } I guess we 'll give it maximum points in everything . { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah , the yeah , it 's definitely attractive . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , I agree . User Interface : Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot . Marketing : Well , I thought we 'd um kinda said that you 'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? Project Manager : Yeah , just prepare one now . User Interface : Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . User Interface : It will be red , too . Marketing : Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at . That 's this one . What do you all say ? Industrial Designer : So ? Project Manager : I reckon it { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : I I go for seven . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yes . Marketing : Oh { vocalsound } we 're all so proud of the { gap } . Project Manager : Seven , yeah , it 's terribly sexy . Yeah . Marketing : Okay , so that 'll be a seven for A_ . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Could { disfmarker } oh no , you ca n't whilst that 's up there . Okay um uh what I 've done on the next page is I 've set it up so we just put the marks in . Project Manager : Ah , okay . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : Excellent . Except we ca n't { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : But we can we can { disfmarker } Marketing : But that 's alright . Project Manager : uh we can if we { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I can I can take note uh uh { disfmarker } Marketing : If you take a note of them , and then I 'll put them in in a minute . Project Manager : then yeah , I 'll take a note , it 's fine . Marketing : Okay , so { vocalsound } we 're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? Industrial Designer : Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , Project Manager : I think it does . User Interface : I would think yes , yeah . Marketing : Yeah . I mean { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so if you 're left-handed you 're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . User Interface : Yeah , Project Manager : Alright . User Interface : so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m { vocalsound } model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : But that 's gon na be a problem , Industrial Designer : But then { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : 'cause you do n't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So bu it 's it 's not a huge problem , Marketing : I th I think it 's not { vocalsound } it 's not like it 's a pen . Industrial Designer : because i i it is operatable . User Interface : But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : so they just { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , but I mean because it 's not like it 's a pen , you know , left-handed people ca n't normally write right-handed , User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : but they can normally do most things right-handed , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : so I would say it 's not such a big issue . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : so i if the majority are right-handed , it 's uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yep . Marketing : So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : So maybe we need to put { disfmarker } that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? Project Manager : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : What do you what do you all think ? Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Six . User Interface : Or maybe six , because it 's just one one i one among the issues , Project Manager : Yeah , I think I think for um { disfmarker } User Interface : I mean . Yeah . Project Manager : I mean most people are right-handed , so in { vocalsound } in terms of our greatest target group , I think it 's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want { disfmarker } might want to um { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : One more thing is that i Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , Project Manager : They { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so it opens on the side . So { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : No , yeah , but mm but we have it { vocalsound } nicely { vocalsound } with the hinges here { gap } yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah yeah yeah , I mean { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : So it wo n't be a problem , Marketing : Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : So you guys can decide wh whether { disfmarker } User Interface : it will be { disfmarker } and it will be { disfmarker } it wo n't be heavy . Industrial Designer : Oops . Marketing : I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top . Industrial Designer : Yeah , but we { disfmarker } which makes it kind of really big , yeah . User Interface : Yeah well yeah , Project Manager : The length is gon na be difficu User Interface : but it 's it 's a bit long . It 's a little bit long . Marketing : Yeah um { disfmarker } User Interface : Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah . Marketing : But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Uh this this kind of uh makes it more { gap } Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Because { disfmarker } User Interface : S uh slightly smaller . Industrial Designer : and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel . Marketing : So you have to keep that side flat . User Interface : Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side 's flat , than that will work . Industrial Designer : Right . Okay . Marketing : Okay . Um { vocalsound } okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we 're gon na stick a locator on the T_V_ ? Industrial Designer : No , we have a locator . Project Manager : No , we 're gon na put it like { disfmarker } we 've got th there 's the locator dot . Marketing : There 's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a { disfmarker } that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , User Interface : Mm that you stick on T_V_ . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : does n't it ? To make it beep . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Or a buzzer . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some { disfmarker } to make some sounds , so { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : So that 's two , so that 's seven , yeah . It 's locatable ? User Interface : Yep . Marketing : Fabulous . D_ . Industrial Designer : Intuitive , completely intuitive . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . If { vocalsound } uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : and it 's { disfmarker } I th I think it 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : I 'd say six , 'cause the { disfmarker } I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you 've got it . I really like the way you have it , Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : but it 's not the immediate thing that you 're used to . Industrial Designer : Intuitive . Marketing : Yeah , and I mean d Industrial Designer : And uh even the scroll , it 's a it 's a new technology Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni Project Manager : Might be { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it 's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it . Project Manager : But it { disfmarker } and it 's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : So , should we maybe say f a five Industrial Designer : So l Marketing : and say it is intuitive , Project Manager : Five ? Marketing : but it 's different , so , do you know , I mean it 's obvious how to use it , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay . I 'm gon na give a seven in everything , so . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yep . Project Manager : I 'm happy with five ? User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : I 'm glad you 're accepting this . It has taken a little while , has n't it ? Um intuitive but { disfmarker } Sorry , it 's really hard to write on those . Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } Marketing : I just went a bit mad , did n't I ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Um okay , cool , E_ , okay . Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . Investigate . Project Manager : Yep . But otherwise it 's superb . Marketing : So , should we give it a six ? Project Manager : Six . Marketing : Six ? User Interface : Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , Industrial Designer : { gap } . User Interface : but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting . User Interface : yeah ? See . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah , so it 's kinda { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic . Marketing : I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , Project Manager : Well we 've banned them from { disfmarker } Marketing : and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm yeah . Marketing : so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest . Industrial Designer : And moreover it it has um { vocalsound } L_C_D_ and everything , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , it 's varied . Marketing : Okay , so we give that a six , Project Manager : Yeah . Six ? Marketing : yeah . Okay , F_ . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah , { gap } { disfmarker } it does have { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Absolutely . Project Manager : Voice control have seven . Marketing : Hang on , how come it 's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That 's just { disfmarker } Project Manager : Ah , that 's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it 's got score , but not on the previous slide . Marketing : Oh okay , cool . Um { vocalsound } right , so { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : So it has voice control . Marketing : Yes , so that 's a seven then . Industrial Designer : Yep . Marketing : Um , cool . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : G_ technologically innovative . Industrial Designer : Anyway it ha yeah , User Interface : Technologi { gap } well { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : it 's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . User Interface : Yeah . Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is { disfmarker } yeah , it 's kind of new . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , but I mean you do n't { disfmarker } Project Manager : All of the components have been used in other things before . Industrial Designer : Yeah , but they 've been brought together in a remote . User Interface : But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . Marketing : They 're never been used i they 've never been using remote remote control before I do n't think . Project Manager : But do { disfmarker } yeah , yeah . Yeah . Marketing : { gap } . Project Manager : What do you reckon , five , six ? Marketing : Yeah , what do you all think ? User Interface : Six . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : Six ? User Interface : I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Well , that 's it , I mean { disfmarker } User Interface : It still has to do what i what it has to do . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , has n't it ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : So , I do n't think many peop Project Manager : Space remote . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : That 's it , they can take it with them . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Put fashion in electronics . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Absolutely . { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah , is n't it fashionable ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : The carrot banana remote . { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah , sure . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : It 's the maximum fashion . Marketing : So , we give it seven , and we write { disfmarker } User Interface : Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : There we go . Industrial Designer : I think that 's a { gap } . User Interface : So I think we 've done very well , but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Cool . Project Manager : Very good . User Interface : { vocalsound } What 's the assessment ? Marketing : So , we need the average here , so we got { disfmarker } User Interface : The average is about six and something . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , one . User Interface : A little bit over six . Marketing : Seven { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } There are how many sixes ? Project Manager : Or a seven { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : One , two , three . Marketing : So we 've got four sevens , User Interface : No , wait , a little bit under six . Marketing : so that 's twenty eight , Industrial Designer : Three . User Interface : No , wait . Marketing : three sixes , Industrial Designer : And one five . Marketing : eighteen . User Interface : Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . Industrial Designer : Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one . Project Manager : Six point point { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Fifty one divided by { disfmarker } User Interface : Six point something , yeah . Marketing : Two three four { disfmarker } Seven eight . Project Manager : about six point five . User Interface : { vocalsound } Six point five , yeah . Project Manager : Close enough . Marketing : Okay , that 's pretty good , I think . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Now wait until we { vocalsound } get to finance and then we 'll see if we can afford it . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : That 's all you 've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ? Marketing : Um no , that 's it , Project Manager : That 's it ? Marketing : yeah . 
Query : Why did Project Manager agree with Marketing when assessing the criteria of matching the operating behaviour of the user ? Marketing : Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? Industrial Designer : Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , Project Manager : I think it does . User Interface : I would think yes , yeah . Marketing : Yeah . I mean { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so if you 're left-handed you 're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . User Interface : Yeah , Project Manager : Alright . User Interface : so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m { vocalsound } model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : But that 's gon na be a problem , Industrial Designer : But then { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : 'cause you do n't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So bu it 's it 's not a huge problem , Marketing : I th I think it 's not { vocalsound } it 's not like it 's a pen . Industrial Designer : because i i it is operatable . User Interface : But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : so they just { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , but I mean because it 's not like it 's a pen , you know , left-handed people ca n't normally write right-handed , User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : but they can normally do most things right-handed , Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Right . Marketing : so I would say it 's not such a big issue . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : so i if the majority are right-handed , it 's uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yep . Marketing : So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : So maybe we need to put { disfmarker } that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? Project Manager : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : What do you what do you all think ? Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Six . User Interface : Or maybe six , because it 's just one one i one among the issues , Project Manager : Yeah , I think I think for um { disfmarker } User Interface : I mean . Yeah . Project Manager : I mean most people are right-handed , so in { vocalsound } in terms of our greatest target group , I think it 's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want { disfmarker } might want to um { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . 
Query : What 's the conclusion of the discussion about intuitive when presenting on evaluation criteria ? Marketing : Okay . Um { vocalsound } okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we 're gon na stick a locator on the T_V_ ? Industrial Designer : No , we have a locator . Project Manager : No , we 're gon na put it like { disfmarker } we 've got th there 's the locator dot . Marketing : There 's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a { disfmarker } that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , User Interface : Mm that you stick on T_V_ . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : does n't it ? To make it beep . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Or a buzzer . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some { disfmarker } to make some sounds , so { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : So that 's two , so that 's seven , yeah . It 's locatable ? User Interface : Yep . Marketing : Fabulous . D_ . Industrial Designer : Intuitive , completely intuitive . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . If { vocalsound } uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : and it 's { disfmarker } I th I think it 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : I 'd say six , 'cause the { disfmarker } I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you 've got it . I really like the way you have it , Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : but it 's not the immediate thing that you 're used to . Industrial Designer : Intuitive . Marketing : Yeah , and I mean d Industrial Designer : And uh even the scroll , it 's a it 's a new technology Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni Project Manager : Might be { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it 's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it . Project Manager : But it { disfmarker } and it 's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : So , should we maybe say f a five Industrial Designer : So l Marketing : and say it is intuitive , Project Manager : Five ? Marketing : but it 's different , so , do you know , I mean it 's obvious how to use it , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , okay . I 'm gon na give a seven in everything , so . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yep . Project Manager : I 'm happy with five ? User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : I 'm glad you 're accepting this . It has taken a little while , has n't it ? Um intuitive but { disfmarker } Sorry , it 's really hard to write on those . Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } Marketing : I just went a bit mad , did n't I ? 
Query : Summarize the discussion about project finance . Project Manager : Alright . So , finance . And we 'll see if we can unscrew this first . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Cool , there we go . Project Manager : Sorry , this is { disfmarker } I 'm just um { disfmarker } Marketing : { gap } . There we go and there are the marks . Project Manager : Beautiful . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Not anymore . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Computer no signal ? Industrial Designer : Mm I guess it 'll have to wait for a bit . Project Manager : Adjusting . There we go . Okay , so we 've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . And now we have to calculate the production costs . So I 've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . Can you read that ? Almost . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : More or less . Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . No hand dynamo , right ? Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : One simple battery . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : No kinetic energy , no solar . The chip , we 're going for an advanced chip on print . Industrial Designer : Advanced , yeah . Project Manager : We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . User Interface : Yep . Project Manager : Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . User Interface : Yeah , yes . Project Manager : Case material we said rubber . User Interface : Rubber . Industrial Designer : Yep . Project Manager : I do n't know what special colour means . Industrial Designer : Mm anything uh I think which is not more { gap } . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : I think something coloured , yeah , probably . So I think this is probably special co no ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : It could be { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , does n't it ? You know . Project Manager : Rub rubber comes coloured , User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : it 's { disfmarker } I would { disfmarker } { vocalsound } maybe it 's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it 's different . User Interface : Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , Project Manager : Yeah , let 's leave it as zero , 'cause it 's easy . { vocalsound } User Interface : { gap } yeah yeah , okay . Marketing : Yeah , User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . Project Manager : We we 're definitely going to have to { disfmarker } User Interface : We have pushbuttons , Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : so we 've got pushbutton , and then we 've User Interface : scro we have scroll wheel as well . Project Manager : Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? Industrial Designer : No uh we we have uh yeah . User Interface : S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : And we have L_C_ display Project Manager : And button supplements . User Interface : and { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm no . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : { gap } . No . Industrial Designer : We do n't have { disfmarker } Project Manager : No . No ? Industrial Designer : we 're not using any of that . User Interface : Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel { disfmarker } Project Manager : But the the spinning wheel 's not there . I have { disfmarker } think { disfmarker } maybe it 's integrated with the L_C_ display ? User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : We 've got more than one pushbutton though , User Interface : Okay , let 's { gap } yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : have n't we ? Project Manager : I think the pushbutton { disfmarker } oh . Marketing : 'Cause then you have { disfmarker } Project Manager : I do n't know if that 's one { disfmarker } Marketing : That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total does n't it ? Not counting anything , we 'd still be in budget . Project Manager : Yeah . That seems unlikely . Industrial Designer : Huh ? Project Manager : Push what uh Industrial Designer : Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh . Marketing : Twelve point five . Project Manager : whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we { disfmarker } User Interface : We have to count all of them , or { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm I do n't think so , no . Project Manager : I do n't think that makes sense . Marketing : No . Industrial Designer : No it says what what is the kind of interface , Marketing : Well it does n't , but it uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : No . Industrial Designer : if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it 's a scroll wheel { disfmarker } so we we 've put it 's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : And L_C_ display . Industrial Designer : so that 's that 's the three kind of interfaces that we have . Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . So , as we can see , that 's way too expensive down here . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Wh wh what 's our criteria ? Marketing : This sample sensor { gap } . Project Manager : Our budget 's twelve point five . Industrial Designer : Uh okay . Marketing : Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that 's the most expensive thing on there . Project Manager : Yeah , so that has implications though for the { gap } . Industrial Designer : Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . { gap } when you say { disfmarker } when you press one it says one or it says hello . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : For the locator . Marketing : But that 's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , is n't it ? Industrial Designer : Mm { vocalsound } and the locator also goes away . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : We can afford to get rid of it . User Interface : But it was very no innovative Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : So that means no locator , does it ? User Interface : { gap } innovativeness { gap } . Well um { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : I mean does { disfmarker } Project Manager : What else does it need ? User Interface : Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . Project Manager : Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . User Interface : This would be { disfmarker } Yeah , yeah yeah { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : there you record your samples your speech samples and { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , okay , so we { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : A also i in the case I 'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it 's just rubber , so it 's probably a flat surface rubber . Uh I mean uh um { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : Uh-huh . Marketing : Okay , yeah . Industrial Designer : Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Right , so we need one fifty off . Marketing : See , I was gon na say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause { disfmarker } Project Manager : Take it down to just a scroll wheel . { vocalsound } We could do { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : So tha that { vocalsound } mean that we can not press { disfmarker } how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ? User Interface : Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . Industrial Designer : If { vocalsound } in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d can not push the button . User Interface : Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we do n't have a pushbutton uh we ca we do n't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . Marketing : But that 's { disfmarker } well you would just have to to spin it down { gap } . Project Manager : Yeah . You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : No w w w but ha Marketing : So that 's point three . Industrial Designer : it 's it 's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . User Interface : But I mean { vocalsound } we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . Marketing : Yeah , User Interface : If you { disfmarker } Marketing : I mean that would n't actually cost any more . That 's the spin wheel though , is n't it ? Did n't that come with the L_C_ { disfmarker } Project Manager : That 's with the L_C_ Industrial Designer : That comes with the L_C_D_ ? Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : We decided , 'cause it 's not on our list . Industrial Designer : Oh so so the the this is { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : The scroll wheel is on the side . Industrial Designer : { gap } . So { vocalsound } we 're adding costs for { gap } right , okay uh I mean I think this is good . Marketing : S so we 're point three over . User Interface : So { disfmarker } Project Manager : We 're point three over at the moment . Marketing : Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether Project Manager : It 's nothing n Marketing : and just have pushbuttons for the volume . Could b still put them on the side . But yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , Marketing : I mean the scroll wheel 's pretty cool , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : I have { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up { disfmarker } for up and down . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : On the side . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Okay , yeah . Project Manager : Rather than having three different things that people have to do . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { gap } . User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : There we go . Oh look , we 're way under budget and we 'll make huge profits and we 'll all get bonuses . Marketing : Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve { gap } , could n't we ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . Marketing : Yeah , but { gap } { disfmarker } Project Manager : So that 's alright . We we 'll leave it at that { gap } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : and then I 'll take { disfmarker } I can send it back to management and say we were n't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we 've still got some space for it , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } We have , yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Excellent . Alright . So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? Marketing : No . Industrial Designer : Not really , no . Marketing : No , I do n't think so . Industrial Designer : Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : We { disfmarker } instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : We just got rid of a gimmick that was never { gap } anyway , Industrial Designer : Um yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was { disfmarker } it 's not a great difference I do n't think . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } But we lose the locator . Project Manager : Alright then . Marketing : Really ? Project Manager : We 're gon na have a beep . User Interface : { vocalsound } Well { gap } we 're going to have a beeping thing . Industrial Designer : So instead of speaker , { gap } . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : But yeah , it 's it 's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : 'Kay . { vocalsound } Marketing : Cool . That 's not a very exciting colour . I think you should make it more vegetable-like . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Tha User Interface : Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Oh the the beeper thing . Project Manager : { gap } . Marketing : It { disfmarker } User Interface : But it can be yellow as well . It can come in the same colour as the the case . Project Manager : 'Cause we we wo n't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh { gap } . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : You know , your pen vibrates ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : But only for a very short time . Um okay . So looks like we 've designed a banana . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well done , team . { vocalsound } Um we need { disfmarker } we 've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they 're designing a product . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I think it mm { disfmarker } Marketing : Cool . Project Manager : Feedback ? Ideas ? User Interface : Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Um we kap kept a adding things randomly . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : So , had we known { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : If we 'd had that sheet at the beginning { gap } should 've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let 's just throw it together and do what we can . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , that or not , yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . So { vocalsound } d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } 
Query : What did Marketing agree with group mates when discussing the spin wheel with LCD display ? Marketing : See , I was gon na say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause { disfmarker } Project Manager : Take it down to just a scroll wheel . { vocalsound } We could do { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : So tha that { vocalsound } mean that we can not press { disfmarker } how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ? User Interface : Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . Industrial Designer : If { vocalsound } in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d can not push the button . User Interface : Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we do n't have a pushbutton uh we ca we do n't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .

Project Manager : We decided , 'cause it 's not on our list . Industrial Designer : Oh so so the the this is { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : The scroll wheel is on the side . Industrial Designer : { gap } . So { vocalsound } we 're adding costs for { gap } right , okay uh I mean I think this is good . Marketing : S so we 're point three over . 
Query : Why did group mates disagree with Industrial Designer when discussing whether they lost their evaluation criteria ? Project Manager : Excellent . Alright . So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? Marketing : No . Industrial Designer : Not really , no . Marketing : No , I do n't think so . Industrial Designer : Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : We { disfmarker } instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : We just got rid of a gimmick that was never { gap } anyway , Industrial Designer : Um yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was { disfmarker } it 's not a great difference I do n't think . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } But we lose the locator . Project Manager : Alright then . Marketing : Really ? Project Manager : We 're gon na have a beep . User Interface : { vocalsound } Well { gap } we 're going to have a beeping thing . Industrial Designer : So instead of speaker , { gap } . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : But yeah , it 's it 's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : 'Kay . { vocalsound } Marketing : Cool . That 's not a very exciting colour .

Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Are you sure I got it all { disfmarker } head 's kinda small . User Interface : How 're we placed in terms of the { disfmarker } Marketing : Okay . { gap } User Interface : alright . Marketing : We 're okay ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Guess I should probably try to sit up straight . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Like that ? Okay , cool . Marketing : We 're good ? Industrial Designer : Oh , I think mine 's fallen off . User Interface : It fell { disfmarker } That 's why . Marketing : I guess it 's gon na be hard to drink coffee . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Uh okay . User Interface : Ah . Project Manager : Okay ? { vocalsound } Right , so I 'm just gon na start this PowerPoint real quick . Yeah , PowerPoint . Industrial Designer : Wow . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Very official . Project Manager : Yeah , well , you know , { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah I kinda like this I 'm kinda getting into it . Right . Um . So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we 're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it { vocalsound } right . Just got an agenda to set out what we 're gon na try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um { vocalsound } We 're gon na just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we 're gon na start { disfmarker } talk a little bit about tool training . Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we have n't tried out yet , the whiteboard . { vocalsound } Um { vocalsound } we 've got a general plan for the project how we 're gon na go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . Um I { gap } guess you know game or something um { vocalsound } in real life um so yeah basically I want to { disfmarker } I 'm just gon na { disfmarker } you got { disfmarker } of course you can discuss that , I 'm thinking about um { vocalsound } uh proposing that since we 've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just do n't ask , do n't tell . { vocalsound } Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um { vocalsound } y is Marketing : { vocalsound } You 're just gon na believe me , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : we 'll go from there . Project Manager : Exactly . Um I mean Marketing : Fair enough . Project Manager : obvi if if you guys { disfmarker } if if at the same time if you { disfmarker } like logically if something does n't { disfmarker } like if I 'm like we 're gon na sell a remote control that 's the size of this paper book you know um you say like well that does n't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . I mean we 'll discuss it but I 'm not gon na ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like Marketing : Prove it Project Manager : { vocalsound } yeah yeah exactly Marketing : yeah , okay . Project Manager : so , 'cause we 're { disfmarker } what we 're sort of role playing is y g yeah you 're gon na tap into your own knowledge as well { vocalsound } um . And that 's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um { vocalsound } uh you know maybe i you 're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wan na say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : you can { disfmarker } this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ? Industrial Designer : Oh yeah , that 's fine . User Interface : Sure . Marketing : Works for me . Project Manager : Sweet . Cool . So I guess that that { vocalsound } we 're totally { disfmarker } we 're making a remote control which is thrilling Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the { disfmarker } in real life I dunno if you guys uh { vocalsound } checked the um { vocalsound } uh the corporate website . Um we 've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that 's kind of the corporate strategy is we 're gon na try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham 's or something . So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wan na try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . { vocalsound } Um way we 're gon na go about doing that is basically at first we 're gon na start on the basics . And that 's where I 'm gon na need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um { vocalsound } um the other designer that I ca n't remember , Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um { vocalsound } the Industrial Designer Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : hey right on alright , User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : getting into it um Marketing : There you go . Project Manager : to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you 're gon na be { disfmarker } you 're g you guys are the bottom you know you 're like no you ca n't do that you ca n't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time . And then um we 'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um { vocalsound } I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it 's also better if it 's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . Um and so we 'll work up from there and um then we 'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we 'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me { vocalsound } tell us what 's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible um to try t of sync it all up . So that 's the detailed design . So it 's a three stage kind of thing . Um right so for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it , I have n't tried it yet either um I 'm just gon na start and um mm carry like five remotes around um and just write down { disfmarker } I 'm just gon na write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you { disfmarker } if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wan na write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um . Oh , we skipped introductions . Nice . I 'm a excellent Project Manager . Um .

Project Manager : Yeah I 'm from San Diego as well . Yeah oh man . Marketing : Nice . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : But really uh I last lived in San Francisco , I have n't lived in Cali well I have n't lived in southern California since I was eighteen . Project Manager : Going to s like North Carol I 'm sorry you you just ca n't get a better burrito than what 's available in the s in San Diego . Industrial Designer : It 's different . 'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them . Marketing : It must make all the difference . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah , it really does . Project Manager : Well it 's it 's { vocalsound } i there 's other things too there 's { disfmarker } you just ca n't place it Marketing : Ah . Project Manager : like I { disfmarker } when I went to school in the U_ { disfmarker } in Santa Barbara which is central California the Mexican food is okay , it 's just not good like and yeah it 's like two bucks , Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : like literally two bucks for this massive { disfmarker } I miss Marketing : Right . Project Manager : yeah good call on that . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Where you from in San Diego ? Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : Um just literally just metropolitan San Diego , I live like five minutes from the zoo . So Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : North Park actually if you want to get real specific . Industrial Designer : Yeah , my grandparents lived on um thirty second . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : Close t uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is , Project Manager : Yes . On university , Industrial Designer : and Project Manager : yeah . Industrial Designer : Cafe Forte { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah it 's actually like literally half a mile from my house . Industrial Designer : Cool . Project Manager : Yeah , pretty cool . Small world as we were discussing before . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Especially when we 're all from the same general region . Right so okay , success on the whiteboard . You can harness the awesome power Marketing : There you go . Project Manager : a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s Industrial Designer : Wow . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : and things we like about the city you know , I think we 'll { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Um right so { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : moving on to not fun stuff { vocalsound } uh project finance . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Um basically what we 're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . Um . { vocalsound } This is what the finance department has told me , the C_F_O_ but I do n't know , I 'm not sold on this , it 's pretty dear , I mean twenty f that 's like you know forty bucks for a remote . It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . Um so Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : what we can maybe work on that a later but we 're gon na make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it . Eur internationally . So { vocalsound } um one of the things I I was gon na mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . Um so Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it 's gon na control D_V_D_s Marketing : Makes sense . Project Manager : but um you know Marketing : Uh . Project Manager : I 'll leave that to you guys but that 's something that i i it is gon na be an international sold thing . { vocalsound } Um but we wan na try to make it for twelve fifty . So we wan na try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can . { vocalsound } Um s right so um just to close up , I 'm not sure how much time I 've used mm next time right Project Manager , sorted . Um . { vocalsound } Is uh we 'll meet in another half an hour or so um { vocalsound } and I 'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . Um { vocalsound } U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you 'll also get s assignments from { disfmarker } in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do . Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um { vocalsound } we { disfmarker } what the user 's gon na want . Marketing : What they 're looking for . Project Manager : So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user 's gon na want and what the user can have , you know like uh so { disfmarker } Marketing : And negotiate that . Uh . Project Manager : yeah well it is { vocalsound } and we 'll discuss the trade-offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email . But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um and as more things come up we 'll have meetings and you 'll get emails and so forth . Um any questions , before we get started ? User Interface : I assume that we 're building a stand alone uh remote control , we ca n't kind of build it into other uh products . Project Manager : { vocalsound } You mean to like { disfmarker } User Interface : For instance like a mobile phone or something like that . Industrial Designer : Mm . Sounds interesting . Project Manager : Hmm . { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : I do n't think there 's any rules about it yet . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ? Project Manager : Well , have a think about it . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : I mean User Interface : Yep . Okay . Project Manager : I 'm I 'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it 's certainly do-able Marketing : W yeah . Project Manager : is n't it . I mean um or if we ca n't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of { vocalsound } useful function . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : The clapper . No I mean { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : no , good idea , good idea . We 'll see what { disfmarker } see what { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . User Interface : { vocalsound } Nice . Hot . { vocalsound } Marketing : I like the little cover thingies . Project Manager : Uh-huh y I like that { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . That 's true , I guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wan na do , go back to um { disfmarker } I do n't really have any . Let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish . Uh project announcement . Ts ts ts { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Yeah . Not so much . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : All right we 'll find them , we 're on our own . User Interface : Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ? Project Manager : Yeah yeah let 's do it , let 's do . User Interface : S does anybody have any initial ideas ? Project Manager : I 'm gon na go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause { disfmarker } Marketing : Good idea . Start your minutes . Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah I mean oh yeah right . { vocalsound } So initial ideas . { vocalsound } Marketing : Well it 's pretty much given it 's gon na be universal Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : right , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : or like to have everything on one thing , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : but then , I 've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : S smaller 's better . Marketing : you ca n't tell what they do . Industrial Designer : Simple . User Interface : But { disfmarker } I 'm thinking { disfmarker } I 'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design Marketing : Yeah . Specific . User Interface : so touch screen design rather than button Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : Oh right . That 'd be different . User Interface : so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things . Marketing : Interesting . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah that 's slick Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : is n't it . I mean like { vocalsound } stylist { vocalsound } yeah like a just a User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : True . Project Manager : yeah . Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this , perfect . Um so we 've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um { vocalsound } uh size and functionality . Marketing : Mm . Mm . Project Manager : Um and we also { disfmarker } Marketing : Right . We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you 're not gon na be able to tell them apart , Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Too confusing . Industrial Designer : It 's gon na be too complicated , too crowded with buttons and things . Project Manager : I 'm also gon na note for future reference this idea Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : of um { vocalsound } so you { disfmarker } like { disfmarker } maybe like an L_ { disfmarker } like a touch screen type of remote ? User Interface : Mm-hmm . Possibly . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : I do n't think one exists . Marketing : An interesting option . Project Manager : Be a good idea . Industrial Designer : Needs { disfmarker } it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes . Marketing : Yeah . Definitely . Project Manager : Yeah all the other universal remotes . Um { vocalsound } I do n't know if there 's such a thing out there , I guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi-format like um you know PAL , N_T_S_C_ , region one { disfmarker } Marketing : Right . User Interface : I 'm pretty sure there is . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : I mean I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_ Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : that he just points at his telev any television he wants Marketing : That { disfmarker } User Interface : and it 'll figure out the { vocalsound } the specifications of it Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : and will control it Project Manager : { vocalsound } Interesting . Okay . User Interface : um so Marketing : Awesome . User Interface : I th I assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world . Project Manager : Okay . Okay . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um all right . So . I li I 'm liking that idea , this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features . Um . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Right . Project Manager : Um . { vocalsound } Let 's see . Industrial Designer : I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Yeah . Keeping it nice and slick , would be important . And { disfmarker } I do n't know , like , there 's such a problem with losing them , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : so we 're gon na have to be careful with what like { disfmarker } User Interface : Oh . Marketing : Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Uh let 's see . Um . User Interface : I like the idea of the uh multi plate . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah yeah okay . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } In in Marketing : Fi b like what are they called , those face plate things ? Project Manager : Think they 're just called face plates ? Marketing : Is n't there a name for them ? Project Manager : I do n't know . Industrial Designer : { gap } something , Marketing : Are they ? I dunno . Industrial Designer : uh we 'll have to come up with a name , User Interface : I like . Industrial Designer : patent it . User Interface : We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well . Marketing : Yeah . Something really cool . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Leopard print or something . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } For those cold winter days . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Leopard print . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Um . Marketing : Hmm . Industrial Designer : I think , it would n't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . Marketing : True . Project Manager : Mm . But if we 're bundling it { disfmarker } { vocalsound } unless we 're selling their telly with the remote . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Um { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it . Industrial Designer : True . User Interface : If you 're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either { disfmarker } Marketing : True . User Interface : well there used to be those whistling devices but that 's a little bit annoying . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . Kinda like how on a lot of um { vocalsound } uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes { vocalsound } , User Interface : Th Marketing : Right . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : could we do something like that ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I think so . User Interface : That 's cool . Marketing : Probably . User Interface : I think we could design into that . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Good . Project Manager : Um yeah { vocalsound } I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of Marketing : Mm . Yeah . Project Manager : you know { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that 's last couple of years , very much so . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Curves . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty { disfmarker } you know it 's pretty expensive Marketing : Right . Project Manager : so maybe we might wan na trade off some of the features for a lower price . Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote Marketing : { vocalsound } Right . Project Manager : that 's black and you know m massive , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere . Marketing : Mm . Definitely . Project Manager : But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we 're gon na sell it Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : and um { disfmarker } Marketing : Or if you our users in mind , like these { disfmarker } grandmas are not gon na be into this whole new let 's design , no it 's { disfmarker } they 're used to the buttons so we 'll have to be careful of exactly who we 're marketing this to , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : and who we 're gon na be able to get it out of . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : 'S true . Marketing : But { disfmarker } User Interface : We 're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ? Project Manager : Twenty five Euros . Marketing : Euros . User Interface : { vocalsound } Slight difference I guess . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . { vocalsound } They 're all weaker than { disfmarker } they 're all stronger than the Dollar . Although , computer parts , all { disfmarker } Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : if you 're gon na upgrade your computer , buy it in the States . Like um do you guys know Fry 's ? Huge computer uh electronics store ? User Interface : No . Marketing : Mm-mm . Project Manager : They serve um { disfmarker } right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about . Right so um let 's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I 'm gon na put these initial ideas that we 've got in the um { vocalsound } project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we 've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we 've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : And uh right so thanks for that . Let 's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into . Marketing : With half an hour ? Project Manager : Um . Yes . Marketing : 'Kay . Perfect . Project Manager : Thanks guys . Marketing : Cool . Industrial Designer : Alright . User Interface : Thank you . 
Query : What did the Project Manager think of the profit when discussing the financial issue and why ? Project Manager : moving on to not fun stuff { vocalsound } uh project finance . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Um basically what we 're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . Um . { vocalsound } This is what the finance department has told me , the C_F_O_ but I do n't know , I 'm not sold on this , it 's pretty dear , I mean twenty f that 's like you know forty bucks for a remote . It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . Um so Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : what we can maybe work on that a later but we 're gon na make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it . Eur internationally . So { vocalsound } um one of the things I I was gon na mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . Um so Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it 's gon na control D_V_D_s Marketing : Makes sense . Project Manager : but um you know Marketing : Uh . Project Manager : I 'll leave that to you guys but that 's something that i i it is gon na be an international sold thing . { vocalsound } Um but we wan na try to make it for twelve fifty . So we wan na try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can . { vocalsound } Um s right so um just to close up , I 'm not sure how much time I 've used mm next time right Project Manager , sorted . Um . { vocalsound } Is uh we 'll meet in another half an hour or so um { vocalsound } and I 'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . Um { vocalsound } U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you 'll also get s assignments from { disfmarker } in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do . Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um { vocalsound } we { disfmarker } what the user 's gon na want . Marketing : What they 're looking for . 
Query : What did the group discuss about the functions of the remote control ? User Interface : I assume that we 're building a stand alone uh remote control , we ca n't kind of build it into other uh products . Project Manager : { vocalsound } You mean to like { disfmarker } User Interface : For instance like a mobile phone or something like that . Industrial Designer : Mm . Sounds interesting . Project Manager : Hmm . { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : I do n't think there 's any rules about it yet . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ? Project Manager : Well , have a think about it . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : I mean User Interface : Yep . Okay . Project Manager : I 'm I 'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it 's certainly do-able Marketing : W yeah . Project Manager : is n't it . I mean um or if we ca n't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of { vocalsound } useful function . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : The clapper . No I mean { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : no , good idea , good idea . We 'll see what { disfmarker } see what { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . User Interface : { vocalsound } Nice . Hot . { vocalsound } Marketing : I like the little cover thingies . Project Manager : Uh-huh y I like that { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . That 's true , I guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wan na do , go back to um { disfmarker } I do n't really have any . Let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish . Uh project announcement . Ts ts ts { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Yeah . Not so much . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : All right we 'll find them , we 're on our own . User Interface : Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ? Project Manager : Yeah yeah let 's do it , let 's do . User Interface : S does anybody have any initial ideas ? Project Manager : I 'm gon na go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause { disfmarker } Marketing : Good idea . Start your minutes . Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah I mean oh yeah right . { vocalsound } So initial ideas . { vocalsound } Marketing : Well it 's pretty much given it 's gon na be universal Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : right , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : or like to have everything on one thing , 
Query : What did the Project Manager think of the appearance and the buttons of the remote control when discussing about the multi functions ? Marketing : but then , I 've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : S smaller 's better . Marketing : you ca n't tell what they do . Industrial Designer : Simple . User Interface : But { disfmarker } I 'm thinking { disfmarker } I 'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design Marketing : Yeah . Specific . User Interface : so touch screen design rather than button Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : Oh right . That 'd be different . User Interface : so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things . Marketing : Interesting . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah that 's slick Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : is n't it . I mean like { vocalsound } stylist { vocalsound } yeah like a just a User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : True . Project Manager : yeah . Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this , perfect . Um so we 've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um { vocalsound } uh size and functionality . Marketing : Mm . Mm . Project Manager : Um and we also { disfmarker } Marketing : Right . We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you 're not gon na be able to tell them apart , Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Too confusing . Industrial Designer : It 's gon na be too complicated , too crowded with buttons and things . Project Manager : I 'm also gon na note for future reference this idea Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : of um { vocalsound } so you { disfmarker } like { disfmarker } maybe like an L_ { disfmarker } like a touch screen type of remote ? User Interface : Mm-hmm . Possibly . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : I do n't think one exists . Marketing : An interesting option . Project Manager : Be a good idea . 
Query : Why did Industrial Designer put forward that the appearance design should be paid due attention when discussing the user interface ? Industrial Designer : I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Yeah . Keeping it nice and slick , would be important . And { disfmarker } I do n't know , like , there 's such a problem with losing them , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : so we 're gon na have to be careful with what like { disfmarker } User Interface : Oh . Marketing : Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Uh let 's see . Um . User Interface : I like the idea of the uh multi plate . 
Query : What did the Industrial Designer recommend to do when discussing the naming of remote control and why ? Marketing : Is n't there a name for them ? Project Manager : I do n't know . Industrial Designer : { gap } something , Marketing : Are they ? I dunno . Industrial Designer : uh we 'll have to come up with a name , User Interface : I like . Industrial Designer : patent it . User Interface : We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well . Marketing : Yeah . Something really cool . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Leopard print or something . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } For those cold winter days . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Leopard print . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Um . Marketing : Hmm . 
Query : Summarize the group 's plan of their marketing strategy . Project Manager : We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty { disfmarker } you know it 's pretty expensive Marketing : Right . Project Manager : so maybe we might wan na trade off some of the features for a lower price . Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote Marketing : { vocalsound } Right . Project Manager : that 's black and you know m massive , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere . Marketing : Mm . Definitely . Project Manager : But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we 're gon na sell it Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : and um { disfmarker } Marketing : Or if you our users in mind , like these { disfmarker } grandmas are not gon na be into this whole new let 's design , no it 's { disfmarker } they 're used to the buttons so we 'll have to be careful of exactly who we 're marketing this to , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : and who we 're gon na be able to get it out of . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : 'S true . Marketing : But { disfmarker } User Interface : We 're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ? Project Manager : Twenty five Euros . Marketing : Euros . User Interface : { vocalsound } Slight difference I guess . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . { vocalsound } They 're all weaker than { disfmarker } they 're all stronger than the Dollar . Although , computer parts , all { disfmarker } Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : if you 're gon na upgrade your computer , buy it in the States . Like um do you guys know Fry 's ? Huge computer uh electronics store ? User Interface : No . Marketing : Mm-mm . Project Manager : They serve um { disfmarker } right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about . Right so um let 's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I 'm gon na put these initial ideas that we 've got in the um { vocalsound } project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we 've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we 've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure . 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Lynne Neagle AM : Good afternoon . Can I welcome Members to the virtual meeting of the Children , Young People and Education Committee this afternoon ? In accordance with Standing Order 34.19 , I 've determined that the public are excluded from the committee 's meeting , in order to protect public health . In accordance with Standing Order 34.21 , notice of this decision was included in the agenda for this meeting , which was published last Thursday . This meeting is , however , being broadcast live on Senedd.tv , with all participants joining via video-conference . A record of proceedings will be published as usual . Aside from the procedural adaptation related to conducting proceedings remotely , all other Standing Order requirements for committees remain in place . The meeting is bilingual , and simultaneous translation from Welsh to English is available . Can I remind everyone that the microphones will be controlled centrally , so there 's no need to turn them on and off individually ? We 've received apologies for absence from Hefin David AM , and there is no substitution . Can I ask Members if there are any declarations of interest , please ? No . Okay , thank you . Can I just note for the record that if for any reason I drop out of the meeting , the committee has agreed that Dawn Bowden AM will temporarily chair while I try to rejoin ? Moving on , then , to item 2 this afternoon , which is an evidence session with the Welsh Government in relation to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on health and social services as they relate to children and young people in Wales . I 'm very pleased to welcome Vaughan Gething AM , the Minister for Health and Social Services ; Julie Morgan AM , Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services ; Albert Heaney , deputy director general of the health and social services group ; Nicola Edwards , deputy director , childcare , play and early years ; Jean White , chief nursing officer ; and Tracey Breheny , who is deputy director of mental health , substance misuse and vulnerable groups . Thank you all very much for your attendance today—we appreciate your time . We 've got lots of questions that we 'd like to cover , which we 'll go straight into , with questions from Siân Gwenllian . Sian Gwenllian AM : Good afternoon . How much do we understand about how this virus impacts children and young people , and their role in transmitting the virus ? And how important is it that this is considered in the Welsh Government 's exit strategy , especially in the context of reopening schools ? Vaughan Gething AM : Okay . I think it 's fair to say that our understanding is developing across all age ranges about the virus and its impact . It 's still the case that children and young people are less likely to be affected significantly by COVID-19 than people with a range of healthcare conditions , and in particular the age grade that we 've seen , and that 's underpinned the advice we 've given to the whole population about self-isolation by people in age categories , as well as the extremely vulnerable group we advise to shield . We still do n't understand everything about the role that children have to play in the transmitting of the virus , and this is one of the difficulties we face . Because in cold and flu , children transmit the virus and they 're also susceptible , in particular to the flu , as well ; that 's why we have a childhood immunisation programme for the flu as well . We do know that there 's some developing evidence about what 's called a Kawasaki-like syndrome , but that 's affecting very small numbers of children . We have one possible case in Wales—a child who 's in critical care—but that is n't confirmed . That 's still a developing knowledge base . So , the rest of the world is still trying to understand that too . But the generals still apply—that children are less likely to be affected than older people , but can nevertheless still become unwell , and that 's , if you like , one of the few positives in this condition . But as I say , we 're still learning , so I wo n't try and present a fully accurate or finalised picture of knowledge in this area . Sian Gwenllian AM : And in terms— [ Inaudible . ] Vaughan Gething AM : Chair . Sorry . Excuse me , Chair . Sorry—with apologies to the Member , my translation stopped after a while , so I heard the first part translated , and then it just fell off . I 'm really sorry , but I did n't want to try to answer a different question to the one that may be being asked , and do n't think that 's fair to the Member or other members of the committee . Lynne Neagle AM : Can we check that translation is back on , please , and maybe Siân could repeat her question ? Vaughan Gething AM : I can hear it , yes . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , Siân , would you mind repeating that , please ? Sian Gwenllian AM : Not at all . I was discussing NHS services , including critical care services , and I was asking whether there is sufficient capacity in place to manage any increase . We , of course , hope that there wo n't be any increase , but should there be an increase , particularly in paediatric cases of coronavirus—let 's say such a thing were to happen and this rare syndrome that you mentioned did emerge here in Wales—do we have the capacity in place to deal with these , and with the impact of coronavirus more generally on children ? Vaughan Gething AM : At this point in time , the answer is 'yes ' , and there is always a significant caveat , though , and the 'but ' that comes in there is that despite the fact that we 've got a plan for surge capacity in paediatric care— . So , when we increased critical care right across the national health service , we of course looked at paediatric care as part of that as well . So , we can flex up our capacity . But the challenge in all of that this is—it 's part of my caution and the Government 's caution about moves out of lockdown . So , it 's much easier to go into lockdown than to come out of it , and I know you heard evidence from the Minister for Education last week about the approach that she wants to take and the principles behind doing that . So , actually , we 'll need to think carefully about if we are reopening schools , even on a limited basis , what that then does to the circulation of coronavirus within that group of children as well as within the wider community , and then to try to understand whether the current capacity we have planned for in surge capacity is still going to be enough , because , actually , one of the real success stories of the first stage of the fight with coronavirus is that we have n't had our critical care capacity filled up . It 's been extended , and the extension has meant that we have n't been overtopped . If we had n't done that , we definitely would have been . And we 'll need to carry on testing ourselves and seeing what 's happening and looking at the evidence and making sure that the plan we already have got that we published for paediatric critical care is still fit for purpose , and again to reconsider if we need to do things differently . But that 's part of the difficulty of being a Minister at the moment—you do n't know everything that 's coming , and on this disease in particular , we do know that we 're still learning with each passing day . Lynne Neagle AM : [ Inaudible . ] —Siân ? Sian Gwenllian AM : Hello . Yes , those are the questions I had on that section . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay . Lovely . Thank you very much . Right , we 'll move on now then to some question on access to health services from Dawn Bowden . Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you , Chair . Minister , just some concern that you will have heard about in terms of parents and carers maybe not taking their children into the healthcare system for other conditions while the coronavirus pandemic is with us . How are you monitoring that situation at the moment and have you had to look at your own commutation strategy in relation to that ? Vaughan Gething AM : We 've had to look at some specifics around communication , so challenges about not just different languages , but about how we get messages to people in a very different environment , and it 's really challenging . So , for example , our health visitor service has absolutely not stopped . We 've had to think about the way it works , and I had this conversation earlier this week with the chief nurse . But the bigger challenge are parents refusing to engage with the service . I understand people 's fear and anxiety , but that then means that their family , and in particular their child , is n't getting the sort of proactive care that we would want them to have . So , there 's a real concern both at the professional leadership end and for the chief nurse and for Ministers as well about how we can get through . That 's actually about rebuilding people 's confidence in the service , and that is n't straightforward because there 's a broader concern about coronavirus still circulating . But I think for us it 's really important to reiterate that we have thought again about how to provide the service . We 've thought about how to protect staff and families and the very clear message to parents is to please make sure that when health and care professionals are calling to help and support your family , please discuss your concerns with them . We 're doing even more remotely , via telephone and online as well . There are times you need to be physically in the same place , for example on routine vaccinations , because we certainly have n't stopped that programme either , and I really would n't want to see that one of the unintended consequences of what we 've done is that if parents do n't engage with that service , we could potentially see a rise in other diseases . We 're all , I think—not just you in your constituency , but others who are on this call and others as well—seeing an occasional reappearance of measles , and that 's because people did n't engage with the vaccination programme . I do n't want , either myself or a different health Minister in the future , to be sat here talking about how in years to come the failure to engage in a vaccination programme has led to clearly avoidable but significant harm to children and young people and the communities they live in . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . Jean , you wanted to come in . Vaughan Gething AM : You need to unmute yourself . Oh , no— Professor Jean White : Thank you . I just want to add to what the Minister said . So , I approached the immunisation lead in Public Health Wales to see exactly what has been happening recently and they said at the very beginning of the outbreak parents were very reluctant about coming forward for their routine immunisations , but recently , through lots of energy from the immunisation clinics and the leads within it reaching out to families , that trend seems to have turned and there 's now a much better attendance . One of the most important things we can do to protect our children is to make sure they have their vaccinations . So , yes , there was a bit of a downturn , but it does seem to be improving at the moment . Thank you . Dawn Bowden AM : Okay , thank you . And that answered my second question , Chair , so I 'm happy to leave it there . Thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you very much . We 're going to go on now to some questions about mental health from Siân Gwenllian . Siân . Sian Gwenllian AM : It 's a cause of great concern to us all , of course , in terms of the impact of this crisis on mental health and well-being among our children and young people . So , what assessment has the Government undertaken of the impact on these aspects in young people and what work is being done to understand the impact of the pandemic ? What longer term measures will be put in place and what support services will be put in place ? Vaughan Gething AM : Again , I think it 's helpful that you 've already heard from the education Minister last week , because I think the first of her key principles for returning to school is the impact on the emotional health and well-being of children . So , children 's mental health was a central concern and remains so for both myself and the education Minister . Part of the honest challenge , again , is that we do n't fully understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children but we do expect there will have been an impact . So , we 're working together with both health boards and our own knowledge and analytical services across the Government to both try to further understand what that is and the difference . Until we have more contact with families , we may not fully understand that , and that 's a real point of concern for me . In all of the unknowns within this , the impact on mental health and well-being is absolutely one of them , because we 're looking at how we then develop not just a recovery plan for the economy but a recovery plan around mental health , how we support people , and that will have to be informed by the understanding of what 's happening when we get more engagement with families about the level of need , and then how we need to think about that . Obviously , it 's a key factor for their return to school , but , actually , for the life children and young people lead outside the school environment , and that will be difficult because we 're going to phase out of lockdown—it 's not going to be a one-hit measure . That absolutely is n't going to happen . We 're going to be looking at , at each point , what difference has been made , what more we can do . And , again , there are the efforts we 're making to make sure that our online support services and our telephone support services—that we keep on reminding people that they 're there and are available , and we want people to make use of them , because I know , as this committee said , we 'd much rather be able to support people and intervene earlier rather than wait until there 's a much bigger problem in a period of months in the future . Sian Gwenllian AM : So , in reality , there 's been no assessment undertaken because it 's difficult to do that . So , the full picture in terms of the outcomes of the crisis—you do n't know what they are at the moment as things stand . Vaughan Gething AM : We ca n't know , because we do n't have that level of contact . There is a development— . I would n't say that no work 's being done , but I could n't tell you honestly that that work is finalised and we have a definitive understanding of the picture . If I tried to say that , then I 'm sure you 'd ask me , 'How on earth can you say that ? If you 're not having regular contact with people , you ca n't possibly understand the picture . ' And it 's much better to say , 'We do n't understand the full picture . We know there 'll have been an impact . We 're working alongside health boards and others , but we 'll know more as we carry on having more contact with families . ' I 'll look at a variety of different areas , again , both to reform the recovery plan , but also then to understand what we need to do at various points in the future , and the picture that we 're seeing is n't straightforward and we need to make sure that we do n't try to pretend to ourselves or to the public that there is a one-off measure that will allow us to be successful in all the areas that we 'd want to be . Sian Gwenllian AM : But can you give the committee an assurance today that this area of mental health and well-being is going to be a priority for you as health Minister ? Vaughan Gething AM : Of course . Not just on the work we 've done in the past ; not just because it 's one of the key principles for the education Minister about the reopening of schools , but it is a real worry list for me about how we understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children and young people , and to move forwards , that we do n't end up with an entire generation of children and young people who grow up with a range of damage because we have n't thought about what that will look like . So , the mental health recovery plan will of course be of very real importance to me . In amongst all the other priorities I have , I 'm certainly not going to allow the mental health and well-being of children and young people to be forgotten . Sian Gwenllian AM : And how does the current capacity in terms of child and adolescent mental health services compare to service capacity prior to the coronavirus outbreak in Wales ? Have you had to shift some resources over from CAMHS , for example , in order to deal with more general aspects of coronavirus ? Vaughan Gething AM : No , we 've actually got— . Maybe perhaps it might be helpful , Chair , if Tracey Breheny could say something about the way that we 're monitoring the impact we have , in terms of we 've got a reporting tool , but also weekly contact with leads in CAMHS services . Lynne Neagle AM : Tracey . Tracey Breheny : Of course . Thanks , Minister . Yes , on that question , we moved pretty quickly at the beginning of the pandemic phase to put in place , as the Minister said , a weekly monitoring tool of all local health boards , so through that tool , we look at that every week in terms of collecting information . Whilst national reporting 's been stood down , we are picking up assurance through that tool on things like staff sickness in CAMHS services , referral numbers and so on , so we do have that tool in place , and at the moment , that 's telling us that the system can meet the capacity ; has the capacity to meet need . Sian Gwenllian AM : Have CAMHS staff been shifted over to do other work during this virus outbreak ? Tracey Breheny : There has been some movement , as I 'm saying , around health boards , particularly where in the first phase of the epidemic the concentration was on in-patient provision , providing critical care , but my understanding is from the latest tool that we looked at last week , those staff are gradually not just returning to work from self-isolation or whatever , or from different parts of the system . Sian Gwenllian AM : And then , what about the capacity for CAMHS primary mental health services ? Has there been a reduction in that capacity since the beginning of the pandemic in terms of in-patients ? Because that 's what I 'm hearing , that there has been such a reduction , but how are those patients then treated and served ? Tracey Breheny : In terms of in-patient capacity , that is in the system in both the north Wales and in the south Wales unit at the moment . There were some discharges of young people , but we 've had the assurance that that was only undertaken where it was clinically safe to do so and where the community support was in place . Sian Gwenllian AM : And finally in this section from me , given that schools are of course closed and that schools are so very important in terms of signposting young people towards services , how can young people access appropriate services—online services , for example ? How are they signposted towards those services at the moment ? Vaughan Gething AM : Well , we 've not closed off general practice and , as you know , we 've expanded the ability for people to access services in an online manner . We 've expanded a range of telephone advice services , so the telephone advice service we already provide , we 've made sure that 's maintained , and both myself and the deputy Minister have referred to that on a number of occasions . I think the real struggle and the real difficulty is actually how you punch through different messages when the broader news agenda is so overwhelmingly focused on headline messages in other areas . That is , again , a worry for me , but the communications we have within the health and care system , people should know where to refer people to and how to provide access to both telephone and online support that continues to be available , and actually , as I say , we 've expanded that right across our healthcare system . That 's what I ’ m keen to see continue into the future . Whatever the post-COVID-19 world is , I do n't want to miss out on the progress we have made in the online provision of services . Of course , most children and young people expect to be able to access services in an online manner already . Sian Gwenllian AM : But , of course , there will be some who are missed ; they may fall between two stools because they won ’ t know where to turn . Vaughan Gething AM : Yes , and that , again , comes back to our challenge of how we help children and young people in their context , with their families , to know where support and advice and guidance is . Many people are defaulting to their general practitioner if they ca n't find advice somewhere else , so that 's why there 's the information we 're providing through general practice to signpost people , so those pathways haven ’ t been closed off . It 's about making sure that people have alternative means that they ’ re prepared to use at this point in time . If we go back to where we started this evidence session , we were talking about the difficulty of families who do n't want to engage in a traditional person-to-person contact or being in the same room as someone else or allowing people into their home . So , there 's a real challenge about how we make the service available , but then encourage people to take it up , so that we don ’ t see much greater harm that we have to try and resolve at a later point . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . I 've got a supplementary from Suzy Davies , and can I remind Ministers about concise answers , please ? Suzy . Suzy Davies AM : Yes , thank you . Just as we 're speaking about children and young people 's mental health , I wonder if you can confirm whether you 've seen the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 's reports about what they call the grave physical and psychological effect on children and young people , and whether the operational guidance you 've given out is responding to that in any way , or maybe there was something in that that you hadn ’ t thought of and you can respond to as we go along . Vaughan Gething AM : I , personally , have n't read that advice , but the Government 's already concerned about the direct physical and mental health impact of lockdown restrictions . You do n't need to be a parent to recognise that that ’ s a potential issue for children and young people . But , I 'm sure— . I have n't read it , but that 's been signposted , so I can check with officials if they have and if that would change the advice and the position that we 're already adopting , because we do regularly look at a range of advice from a range of sources , including the UN , the World Health Organization and others . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , and we are going to come onto children 's rights . But , as you know , Minister , the prevention of young suicide is a cause that is very close to my heart . Can I ask what assessment the Welsh Government has made of an increase in suicide amongst children and young people during this pandemic and because of this pandemic ? Vaughan Gething AM : Apart from the general concern that I 've expressed on mental health generally , we are already investigating , we 're having a— . We 've commissioned , through the Government , the delivery unit to work with the national advisory group , including Dr Ann John and other people , to review the current , unexpected deaths during the start of the pandemic here in Wales , because we want to try to understand the wider concerns about the potential effects of the restrictions on the mental health and well-being of children and young people , and if that is leading to a spike in suicide or not . So , that 's why we 've commissioned that review to be carried out with the current numbers of unexpected deaths that we have , so we 're able then to provide a report to understand where we are . My understanding is that we should have a report on that review before the end of this month and , obviously , I know the committee ’ s got an interest , so if it 's helpful we can write to you once we 've had a chance to receive the report and to look at it . Lynne Neagle AM : Yes , please . Thank you . In terms of provision of crisis care , then , how has that been impacted by the pandemic ? Are those crisis services available for children and young people who need them at the moment ? Vaughan Gething AM : Yes , they continue to be available . We still have seven-day-a-week crisis care . We 've made clear that mental health services , including those for children and young people , are essential services to be provided . They 're not services to be scaled down . They were not part of the series of measures that I stopped within the health service on 13 March . We have built up those crisis care services over a period of time , and the last thing we want to see is to see them disappear during this period of time when there are well-understood concerns about emotional and mental health . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . Moving on to perinatal mental health , this morning I hosted a round-table with the NSPCC where we heard about lots of good practice that 's going on in terms of supporting new mothers and their families in this period , but I wonder if you can tell the committee what you are doing as a Government to make sure that there is consistent perinatal support for all women across Wales in what is a difficult time for any new mother , let alone in a pandemic . Vaughan Gething AM : We continue , again , to provide our perinatal mental health service . That 's not been stopped either . We 've also been looking at how that 's provided on a phone or online basis where possible , because again the same concerns exist about physical contact with people . So , we 're looking to make sure that the progress is n't lost that we 've made . We know there is more to go . So , the service may have changed , but it still absolutely exists . And again , part of the challenge in all of this is about the pause or the interruption in work to create the in-patient capacity that I 've previously committed to . So , I want to understand what that really means , but again the problem is , at this point in the pandemic , I ca n't give you an answer about what that means for that in-patient provision . We 're still committed to it , but I 'm concerned about the time frame—that is partly about the length and the extent . But again , I 'm really impressed by the continuing commitment of our staff to deliver this service for women in what is a particularly uncertain time . It 's difficult enough in terms of the challenge in terms of perinatal mental health in normal times , about people being prepared to come forward and then receiving the sort of response they 'd want , and even more so now . Lynne Neagle AM : Is the Welsh Government aware that there 's apparently been a decrease in the numbers of women being willing to look at mother and baby unit provision , and will you be taking that into account in your planning ? Because , obviously , we would n't want people to think that was because of a lack of need ; it 's down to fear and the lockdown . Vaughan Gething AM : Yes , we 're aware there 's been a reduction in people wanting to make use of the service—or being prepared to make use of the service is probably a better phrase—because we know that 's the same with a range of other areas . There are n't fewer people having strokes than there were at this period of time last year ; the reason why the figures are different is the way that people are behaving because of their concerns about coronavirus . So , I certainly would n't be using this period of time to plan for the need that exists for a facility that we want to create . So , I 'm happy to give that assurance , Chair . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . The next questions are from Suzy Davies . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you , Chair . It 's a straightforward one , really . Obviously , we have the detail of the third sector resilience fund and the—there are two funds , are n't there , for third sector organisations ? But can you give us some indication of how much of that support is being targeted to children and young people , and perhaps you can specifically mention how much of the £6.3 million for hospices is for children 's hospices ? I do n't mind who answers that one . Lynne Neagle AM : The Deputy Minister would like to come in , I think . Julie Morgan AM : Yes . Certainly , I 'm sure the committee is aware , as Suzy has said , of the funds that are available for third sector services . The Deputy Minister and the Chief Whip , of course , announced on 6 April the £24 million Welsh Government third sector COVID-19 response fund , and that of course is more than we would have had as a result of consequentials from the UK Government . They can also benefit from the £400 million economic resilience fund , but I am aware that some groups do n't benefit from that and they may not qualify for that . So , we 've also got third sector support being delivered by WCVA , such as the voluntary services emergency fund , which supports volunteering , and the third sector resilience fund , supporting organisations to stay afloat . We are working very closely with the third sector on issues such as support for fostering services , care leavers and repurposing funding so that they can support the crises . Voices from Care Cymru has developed a specific offer for care leavers , and the Fostering Network provides extended helplines . We 've got lots of examples of third sector partners working with children and young people . Childline bases in Wales remain open and operational , and are still providing information and support . And , actually , about 50 per cent of contact with Childline at the moment is to do with COVID-19 . NSPCC has put together a support page for young people about COVID-19 . The NSPCC UK helpline have also reported a decrease in calls resulting in a referral to children 's social services at the start of the lockdown period , but , since then , the numbers have actually risen . So , there are lots of examples of help for children . Meic , Action for Children , and , of course , Voices From Care Cymru have come up with their own specific package . In terms of the actual percentage that is being spent on children , I ca n't give you an actual figure for that , but , certainly , there are a whole range of projects that are there helping children . I think the Minister for Health and Social Services will be able to respond to the hospice question . Vaughan Gething AM : It 's about £1.5 million from the £6.3 million that 's gone to Tŷ Gobaith and Tŷ Hafan , Suzy . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you very much for that . So , it 's about 25 per cent . Perhaps if you could ask the Deputy Minister , when she 's in a position to do so , to let us have a note . Before we finish on this point , could I ask the Deputy Minister , again , about whether any of the things you 've been talking about now is additional money , because , obviously , you mentioned yourself one of these funds is £24 million . Some of the work you mentioned is continuity of existing work . So , again , if you do n't have the answer to hand , perhaps you could send us a note in due course about how much extra is going in . Julie Morgan AM : Yes . I think most of those things I mentioned are things that are already there , and the £24 million is for support and extra help . So , any more information , I can send to you . Suzy Davies AM : Lovely . Thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you very much . The next questions , then , are from Dawn Bowden on safeguarding and child protection . Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you , Chair , and thank you , Deputy Minister , because one of the questions I was going to ask was around some of the work that you 've been doing with the third sector on safeguarding and child protection , and I think you 've covered that . But what I 'm particularly keen to find out is how you 're monitoring the impact of coronavirus on child protection and safeguarding in the round . I know the health Minister raised this as a concern in Plenary only recently , and it 's really how we are monitoring it , what concerns have been identified , and how we 're going to start to tackle some of those . Julie Morgan AM : Yes . Thank you very much , Dawn , for that question . Obviously , it is difficult to monitor if there 's not easy access to the children that we 're referring to , and that 's why we have been trying to encourage the vulnerable children to go into school or childcare settings . And there 's been a lot of encouragement for that happen . The Minister , the director of education and the director of social services sent out a joint letter recently to all the local authorities , asking them to try to encourage the vulnerable children and the families to get the children to go to school . In fact , we 've now got 890 vulnerable children attending school settings , and that 's the highest number that we 've had at all since the opening of the scheme . But it 's still only a tiny drop in the ocean . But it 's very good , and it is progress that the numbers attending are now going up . But , of course , there are a lot of children who are not attending school and the social services are not necessarily seeing . There has been a drop in safeguarding referrals to social services . Those numbers are now beginning to go up , but there certainly was a significant drop , which is a great deal of concern . One local authority , in fact , reported a drop of 27 per cent in terms of safeguarding referrals compared to this time last year . So , I issued a written statement on 1 May , setting out the work taken forward under our cross-departmental vulnerable children , young people and safeguarding work stream , and encouraging people to report any safeguarding concerns there are . Because , obviously , we are dependent on the public authorities—you know , schools and health services—to report any concerns , and at the moment , obviously , they 're not there to report them . So , we have made this public appeal for everyone to look out for each other , and I was very interested in what Siân Gwenllian told me about what was being done in Anglesey in terms of sending out a message via social media to get people to look and listen , and to raise their concerns , because , obviously , safeguarding is the concern of everybody in the community . But I think that we are reassured in terms of our contact with the local authorities that they are , in fact , keeping close touch , as far as they possibly can , with all the children that are vulnerable . For those where it is very critical , face-to-face contact is still taking place , and there are imaginative ways of trying to keep in touch with all the other children and families . So , it is a difficult situation and we are concerned about it , but I think as much as possible is being done . Lynne Neagle AM : Jean , you wanted to come in on that . Professor Jean White : Just to add to what the Deputy Minister was saying , the health visiting service has not been stopped or stepped back . It has consolidated some of the ways that it does the Healthy Child Wales Programme , but , for those families that are identified as having particular need or have children that are particularly vulnerable , all the normal contacts have been maintained , so they 're not unseen to the normal health visiting service . That covers both Flying Start and general health visiting areas . Thank you . Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you , Jean , for that , and , Deputy Minister , would there be any value at this point in actually revisiting the current Welsh Government definition and guidance around vulnerable children , in terms of who we identify as vulnerable ? Because this opens up a whole new group of children that are not necessarily known to services but can still be vulnerable . So , it 's just looking at the current guidance that we have . Do you think that needs revisiting at all ? Julie Morgan AM : The definition of vulnerable children and young people includes those with a social worker and with statements of special educational needs , and the most vulnerable of these should be prioritised . But we have now looked at this again , and we 've set out an expanded definition , and we intend to publish that this week . This does include discretion for local authorities to have some flexibility and to be able to offer a place for those who may be on the edge of receiving care and support if they are known to be vulnerable by the school or by family support services . Because , obviously , the children that we know about , we know about , but there are those other children who may be on the edge of care—the children that we 've been trying very hard , as part of our policies in the Welsh Government , to keep with their families , with a lot of support . Those are the ones that we also want to support . So , we are giving discretion to the local authorities in order to have a degree of flexibility , and that will be published this week . Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you . Thank you , Chair . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . We 're going to move on now , then , to talk about looked-after children and children on the edge of care , with questions from Janet Finch-Saunders . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you , Chair . Can you set out the impact the coronavirus emergency has had on the care system , including edge-of-care services , and where have there been areas of concern ? Julie Morgan AM : Well , local authorities have obviously had to change their working practices in response to the COVID emergency , so a red-amber-green rating risk assessment was adopted by all local authorities at the start of the pandemic to ensure that vulnerable children and families receive the right way of receiving services and the frequency of contact from the services . This is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis , so every case that is known is being RAG rated and services are being linked to that . Also , there is very close contact between Welsh Government officials and the local authorities . There are weekly meetings between officials and the heads of the children 's services . I ca n't speak too highly , really , about the amount of support and mutual work that has been going on . We 've been assured that there have been no significant increases in the numbers of looked-after children , and the number of placement breaks are minimal . The other interesting good point is the children services workforce remains at 90 per cent plus , and , obviously , that is a great testimony to the dedication of the workforce . So , there 's very close contact . The children are all being monitored individually , and I think in the circumstances we 're all doing what we possibly can . I know that Albert Heaney is able , probably , to respond in more detail to the contacts , if you 'd like to have that . Lynne Neagle AM : I think we 'll move on to the next section . Can I remind everyone again : sharp focused questions and concise answers ? Janet . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thanks . How is Welsh Government ensuring that vulnerable children have access to the necessary technology to maintain contact with their social workers and other support workers and networks ? Julie Morgan AM : It is normal practice to ensure that children and families do have appropriate access to technology to keep in touch with social workers , so that is part of our normal practice . We 're very keen as a Welsh Government that no children are left behind in their education during this period . So , last month , as you will know , the Minister for Education announced £3 million of funding to help digitally excluded learners so that they 've got access to the internet , so that they can fully participate in online learning . So , we do normally ensure that they 've got digital contact for social workers . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you . Can you set out the picture regarding children 's residential care ? What are the challenges these care settings are facing , and have any children 's homes closed ? Julie Morgan AM : Residential children 's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues , and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened . So , I 'm very pleased to report that . We obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported , and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings , and that is going on , although it may be by technology rather than face to face . We know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge , and I think it ’ s easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult . So , there have been a few issues related to that , but , where that has happened , local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis , and really there are not any major issues . In terms of residential care , Hillside is functioning well—no reporting issues . The staffing levels are normal . There are fewer children and young people there , so , in fact , there 's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children , and I think we 've had very good reports about how that has happened . So , I am absolutely reassured by our officials here that everything is as well as it could be . I also meet with the children 's commissioner once a week , who is an independent source , and she said when I met her last week , 'Well , as far as we know , it 's all good news ' . So , I do n't think we have any concerns at the moment about the residential care . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Okay . Moving on to foster care , how is Welsh Government working with local authorities to meet the challenges set out by the Association of Fostering and Adoption Cymru and its fostering guidelines ? Julie Morgan AM : We have worked with the fostering organisations . We have had close communications with them , and we 've supported AFA Cymru to develop guidance for foster carers , and that guidance has been very strongly welcomed across the sector . We 're working with the third sector . I think I mentioned before specific issues such as support for fostering services and , of course , care leavers . The Fostering Network has extended its helpline hours , and , of course , Voices from Care—I mentioned them before—have developed this particular offer of support for care leavers . I 've been reassured , as well , from Voices from Care that the young people appear to be more stable now—that they have contact with . But that 's online help for them . So , we have had quite a lot of contact with the fostering services . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : So , the final point on that , then : the Fostering Network and others , as you know , have called for foster parents who can temporarily no longer foster due to the current virus emergency to be paid a retainer , with all foster carers receiving extra financial support for additional expenses . What is your position on this , please ? Julie Morgan AM : Well , we have n't had any specific representations from local authorities asking for support for foster carers , but some local authorities have paid retainers and some people , I believe , have increased the amount of money that they are paying . They 've also given support for various activities and things—have helped sometimes , I think , with broadband access and that sort of issue . And , obviously , foster carers who do require additional support should be approaching their local authorities or the independent fostering agency . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay . Thank you . Albert , I just wanted to check there was n't anything you wanted to add , please . Albert Heaney : Thank you very much , Chair . I think the only thing to add was relating to monitoring . The Minister has indicated that we are speaking weekly with heads of children 's services , and we do now have a data collection that 's been implemented to capture the critical data in relation to the children 's services . So , that will assist us in our monitoring arrangements going forward . Thank you , Chair . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay . Thank you very much . And the next questions , then , are from Suzy Davies . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you , Chair . I just wanted to have a quick answer from probably the Minister , I think , about the primary legislation and the regulations that followed , about which children 's rights impact assessments have been done . Have any been done , and can they be shared with the committee if they have ? Sorry , Deputy Minister—my mistake . Julie Morgan AM : Well , it 's been a very difficult time , as you appreciate , in terms of having to make legislation very quickly , and it has n't been possible to do the impact assessments that we would normally do . However , I am very pleased to say that we 're actually launching a survey of children . We 're going to be launching it next week . And this is to try to get from children their views of what 's happened , what we 've been doing , and their views on the whole COVID-19 situation . So , we 're doing this in conjunction with the children 's commissioner and with Young Wales and with the Youth Parliament . So , this is an online survey that we hope will be going out to thousands of children , and we will get their response in terms of what are the important issues that have arisen for them , what they feel about what 's happened during this period , what they feel about the way that we 've dealt with the schools , the way that they 've had to cope in not going school and being at home for so long . And so we 're trying to get feedback from young people . So , I 'm very pleased that we 're doing that , but , in terms of an impact assessment , it has been very difficult , as I 'm sure you can imagine , to be able to do those at these times . I think that Albert wants to come in on that . Suzy Davies AM : Yes , because I 'll pursue that in a sec . Lynne Neagle AM : Albert . Albert Heaney : Thank you . Thank you , Chair , and I think Nicola indicated before me , so apologies , Nicola . Just to say for the committee , really importantly , that we have n't introduced any easements in relation to children 's services legislation . I think that 's really quite crucial . So , from a Welsh context , the standards that are in place do remain , so therefore there would n't have been a necessity for us to do a children 's rights impact assessment in relation to the primary legislation . I think that 's particularly a strong point to us in Wales , both in terms of safeguarding arrangements , but also ensuring that children 's rights are protected at a crucial time . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . Nicola . Nicola Edwards : Thanks . In terms of childcare and education , we 're obviously looking at the provisions under the coronavirus Act to allow us to maybe ease some of the statutory requirements , and we are going to be undertaking a full suite of impact assessments on those . Obviously , the coronavirus Act itself was UK Government legislation and they ran their own impact assessments , but , in terms of how we implement it in the childcare and education space—and I think Albert was just saying the same thing—we definitely will be looking at those impacts in terms of going forward . Suzy Davies AM : Okay . Well , just to come back on that then , are you saying to me that , as a result of the various coronavirus regulations that we 've had , no assessments for children 's needs have been postponed , cancelled or done very quickly online rather than in person ? Julie Morgan AM : Well , I think , as Albert said , that there was no relaxation of regulation for children 's social care . You know , that's—there have n't been any in Wales . Suzy Davies AM : No , but that 's what— . There 's no relaxation , but what 's happening in practice ? We 're down on staff across all our councils and in our third sectors—who 's doing the children 's needs assessments , particularly for young carers ? Julie Morgan AM : Well , I— . Albert , can you answer that ? Albert Heaney : I think the first thing to say to the committee is that , going back , we took a very strong line at the beginning that we were n't going to introduce easements in requirements to children 's social services . Of course , through the way that practitioners and social work practitioners have to operate , they are having to operate through a different time . So , assessments are still taking place for child protection and safeguarding concerns ; assessments are still taking place , and especially in relation to—as you mentioned—young carers , to support their needs . So , arrangements— [ Inaudible . ] But they 're having to be slightly differently done—so , some of the technology , and keeping in contact and keeping those visits . So , we 've used , for example , the St David 's Day fund to make sure that care leavers are well supported in terms of having contact and are accessible and able to engage as well . So , we 're having to be a little bit more—and social services departments are having to be a little bit more—innovative in the use of technology in the way that they 've engaged as well . But personal visits are taking place , and visits especially , as the Minister mentioned earlier on—they actually individually assess each case to determine the frequency of visits , to make sure that those contacts are maintained with children at a critical time . Suzy Davies AM : Okay . Thank you . I do n't want to take this much further , but personal visits and social distancing could be slightly problematic . I just want to finish with this one question , if I may . We 've had recommendations from the Carers Trust , or Carers Trust Wales . Have they been accepted by Government , and is it those that are driving the agenda of the task and finish group that you announced the other day , Deputy Minister ? Julie Morgan AM : Well , those will certainly be considered by the task and finish group . I 've had a letter from the Carers Trust about those issues , and we are setting up this group , as you know , and we will be looking at those issues in the group . Suzy Davies AM : Okay . Thank you . Any steal on when that might report ? Julie Morgan AM : I do n't have that at the moment . Suzy Davies AM : Okay . Thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Maybe we could have a note on that , Deputy Minister . Can I just say , we are running short of time ? We did start late , so , if the Ministers are happy , we 'll carry on until 2.10 p.m.—3.10 p.m.—if that 's okay . And the next questions are from Siân Gwenllian . Sian Gwenllian AM : [ Inaudible . ] Lynne Neagle AM : Hold on a sec , Siân , we 've lost translation again . Can we just see what can be done to get the translation back ? Sorry , Siân . Is there anyone who can help with the translation ? There you go , Siân . Thank you . Sian Gwenllian AM : You will know , Deputy Minister—because we have discussed this in private session—my major concerns with regard to the childcare sector , and what kind of childcare sector we will have at the end of this crisis , as families start to return to the workplace . There are still some childcare providers who are falling between the cracks and are n't receiving financial support . Do you agree—are there people who are still not being supported , and why is n't the Welsh Government able to provide that support for everyone in the childcare sector ? Julie Morgan AM : Thank you , Siân , for that question . And I know that we have had a discussion about this before . Basically , we are aware that there are some sectors in the childcare sector that do fall through some of the loops . We have guaranteed that we will pay the money for the childcare offer for three months . So , that is guaranteed to them , and they are able to take advantage of the Government 's job retainer scheme , but that does mean that there is a problem , as I think we 've discussed before , of the double funding issue , and that is something that we have been trying to resolve and there have been discussions with the Treasury in Whitehall about ways forward on this . I 'm going to ask Nicola to come in in a minute , because she 's much more up to date with the discussions about that , but , so far , I do n't think very much progress has been made on that . But we are looking to see if there are any other ways that we can get help to the childcare sector , and I 'm actually following this meeting with a meeting with the Deputy Minister for equality and chief whip , who is responsible for the voluntary sector , because obviously many of the groups that we 're talking about would come under the voluntary sector , because they have voluntary committees , but they fall between many stools , because they rent premises rather than own premises and they do n't have high turnovers that would qualify them for some of these grants . So , perhaps I could ask Nicola to come in to expand on that . Nicola Edwards : Absolutely . Lynne Neagle AM : Briefly , if possible . Nicola Edwards : I 'll try and be brief , because I 'm conscious of time . So , some childcare settings can access funding under the small business rate relief scheme , but certainly not all of them ; some of them can access funding under the economic resilience fund , and , as the Deputy Minister said , we 're following up for some of them to be able to access funding under the third sector resilience funding . All of the childcare settings can apply for the UK Government 's coronavirus job retention scheme , but there are some complications around that in that it 's a salary-based scheme and you ca n't claim two types of public funding for the same individual member of staff . So , if you were using funding under the childcare offer to pay for a particular member of staff 's salary , you ca n't access CJRS and furlough that individual with Government money as well , and that has led to some confusion and complication about how that balances , which we 're trying to work through with the sector and with local authorities around the rules and regulations that the Treasury and HMRC have put in place around that . Alongside that , there 's a whole range of different loans and services that are available . Some of those are less attractive to some childcare settings , but they are still available and Business Wales is offering support and advice for settings on how they can help weather this storm and support their workers as best they can . We 're also having some conversations now with our economy colleagues and with Business Wales about what happens next , the recovery and the return of the sector , and we 've just come out of a meeting with the childcare sector around the support they think they would need to have in place to be able to return from this as well . So , it 's a topic that 's very much live at the moment . Sian Gwenllian AM : I 'm sure you can share my concerns and the concerns of Cwlwm , which represents the childcare sector and the nursery school sector , that there are a number of providers that are n't receiving support at all and are likely to collapse as a result of this . What I ca n't understand is why you , in collaboration with the Minister for the economy , Ken Skates , ca n't devise a specific grant package for the providers that are n't currently receiving support , or we 'll be facing a situation that is very difficult when people are seeking childcare for their children and those settings wo n't be available to them . Why is n't it possible to have a bespoke scheme for those that are falling between the cracks in this sector ? Julie Morgan AM : Well , that is what we 're looking to see—if we can get a bespoke scheme . I absolutely agree with you : it is absolutely vital that we keep this sector going , because it is a fragile sector in any case , and I think about 50 per cent of the childcare settings have temporarily closed down and the reason they 've given for closing down is because they have n't had enough children to make it viable to keep their settings going . So , it is a very worrying situation . They are heavily reliant on the fees that parents pay and , of course , with the social distancing and the lockdown , this has meant that we 've had to discourage children from attending . So , that means the number of children they 've had has been much reduced and it has n't been viable for them to keep going , although obviously it 's great that about half have stayed open so we have somewhere for the children of the critical workers and the vulnerable children to go . But , I absolutely agree with what you 're saying , Siân , and we are looking for a solution , because we know it 's vital not only for the children and their parents , but for the economy as well , that we do have that sector there , surviving after this is all over . So , I can assure you , we 're working very hard , and I think Nicola 's working day and night to try to achieve this . Sian Gwenllian AM : And just finally from me , I 'm very pleased that you are working on this , and I very much hope that we will see a support package that will reach everyone in the sector , because it 's been weeks now since all of this started , and if there 's still no light at the end of the tunnel for some of them , then that needs to be dealt with . But just to conclude , how effective has the provision been in general over this period in terms of providing support for key workers ? Julie Morgan AM : I think it 's been crucial , because how would the majority of the key workers have been able to get to work and do all the wonderful things that they 've been doing if it had n't been for childcare for those who need it ? And we were very pleased to introduce the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme , which means that critical workers and families with vulnerable children are able to have free access to childcare aged 0 to 5 , and I believe that we are the only country in the UK that is providing that free service to the vulnerable children , and so— . I mean , that scheme has only really taken off now since Easter , so we do n't have any particular statistics . Nicola Edwards : I do have some early numbers , if you 'd like me to announce them ? Julie Morgan AM : Yes , that would be very good . Lynne Neagle AM : Very briefly . Nicola Edwards : Yes . In terms of the provision in schools , we 're looking at around 4,000 children a day in schools at the moment . In terms of the children accessing the coronavirus childcare assistance scheme , it has only been two weeks up and running really , so the numbers are quite low , but there were nearly 1,500 children accessing that childcare last week , and of those , just over 100 would fall within the definition of vulnerable children . So , it is picking up there ; it was 900 children the week before that , so we are seeing some traction now that parents are aware that that support is there . Sian Gwenllian AM : Okay , thank you very much . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . And , can I just ask , in terms of the other vulnerable children , what assurance can you give that all the vulnerable children who need to keep in contact with social workers and other key workers are being provided with the necessary technology to do that ? Is that happening in a uniform way ? Julie Morgan AM : Well , that is the intention—that everybody should have the opportunity to have the necessary technology , and certainly , that is what is intended . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . Suzy , very , very briefly , one question on the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service , please . Suzy Davies AM : Just generally , have you had any feedback on the effects on the family courts and the execution of the—well , the child arrangement orders , the various versions of that ? Julie Morgan AM : Yes . In terms of the family courts , as you probably know , a lot of the hearings are going on virtually , but the hearings that are more complex are being postponed to be heard at a later date . So , that 's one of the issues , really—that we may expect a lot of demand on the court service after this period has finished . And obviously , the president of the family division has issued guidance on compliance with family court child arrangement orders , which were his guidance , and obviously , this is directed at separated families subject to the family court , and that offers general advice to parents , recognising that the circumstances for each parent and each family will be different . And the Welsh Government has also provided guidance about staying at home and away from others . But of course , where parents have joint parental responsibility , as you know , the Government has said that children under 18 can be moved between the two households . With the other children , it 's on a case-by-case basis , really , what actually happens . I have met with CAFCASS to see how their operations are going , and all the CAFCASS officials are not attending any courts at all ; they 're sending in any of their views virtually , but it appeared to be that there were n't any major issues arising . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you , and we have definitely now come to the end of our time . So , can I thank the Ministers and officials for attending ? We do recognise what an immensely pressurised time this is for Welsh Government , and we are very appreciative of having your time this afternoon , so thank you both to Ministers and officials . As usual , you will receive a transcript to check for accuracy following the meeting . Diolch yn fawr . Vaughan Gething AM : Diolch yn fawr , Chair . Lynne Neagle AM : Item 3 , then . Can I propose , in accordance with Standing Order 17.42 , that the committee resolves to meet in private for the remainder of the meeting ? Are Members content ? Thank you very much . This is , of course , our last formal business of the National Assembly for Wales before we become the Senedd tomorrow , and it seems fitting that the National Assembly 's last formal proceedings are focused on children and young people , and I 'm sure that we would all agree that it is vital that they continue to be at the centre of the work of our Parliament going forward . We are now going to proceed in private . 
Query : Summarize the ways of continuing mental health service during the lockdown . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you very much . We 're going to go on now to some questions about mental health from Siân Gwenllian . Siân . Sian Gwenllian AM : It 's a cause of great concern to us all , of course , in terms of the impact of this crisis on mental health and well-being among our children and young people . So , what assessment has the Government undertaken of the impact on these aspects in young people and what work is being done to understand the impact of the pandemic ? What longer term measures will be put in place and what support services will be put in place ? Vaughan Gething AM : Again , I think it 's helpful that you 've already heard from the education Minister last week , because I think the first of her key principles for returning to school is the impact on the emotional health and well-being of children . So , children 's mental health was a central concern and remains so for both myself and the education Minister . Part of the honest challenge , again , is that we do n't fully understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children but we do expect there will have been an impact . So , we 're working together with both health boards and our own knowledge and analytical services across the Government to both try to further understand what that is and the difference . Until we have more contact with families , we may not fully understand that , and that 's a real point of concern for me . In all of the unknowns within this , the impact on mental health and well-being is absolutely one of them , because we 're looking at how we then develop not just a recovery plan for the economy but a recovery plan around mental health , how we support people , and that will have to be informed by the understanding of what 's happening when we get more engagement with families about the level of need , and then how we need to think about that . Obviously , it 's a key factor for their return to school , but , actually , for the life children and young people lead outside the school environment , and that will be difficult because we 're going to phase out of lockdown—it 's not going to be a one-hit measure . That absolutely is n't going to happen . We 're going to be looking at , at each point , what difference has been made , what more we can do . And , again , there are the efforts we 're making to make sure that our online support services and our telephone support services—that we keep on reminding people that they 're there and are available , and we want people to make use of them , because I know , as this committee said , we 'd much rather be able to support people and intervene earlier rather than wait until there 's a much bigger problem in a period of months in the future . Sian Gwenllian AM : So , in reality , there 's been no assessment undertaken because it 's difficult to do that . So , the full picture in terms of the outcomes of the crisis—you do n't know what they are at the moment as things stand . Vaughan Gething AM : We ca n't know , because we do n't have that level of contact . There is a development— . I would n't say that no work 's being done , but I could n't tell you honestly that that work is finalised and we have a definitive understanding of the picture . If I tried to say that , then I 'm sure you 'd ask me , 'How on earth can you say that ? If you 're not having regular contact with people , you ca n't possibly understand the picture . ' And it 's much better to say , 'We do n't understand the full picture . We know there 'll have been an impact . We 're working alongside health boards and others , but we 'll know more as we carry on having more contact with families . ' I 'll look at a variety of different areas , again , both to reform the recovery plan , but also then to understand what we need to do at various points in the future , and the picture that we 're seeing is n't straightforward and we need to make sure that we do n't try to pretend to ourselves or to the public that there is a one-off measure that will allow us to be successful in all the areas that we 'd want to be . Sian Gwenllian AM : But can you give the committee an assurance today that this area of mental health and well-being is going to be a priority for you as health Minister ? Vaughan Gething AM : Of course . Not just on the work we 've done in the past ; not just because it 's one of the key principles for the education Minister about the reopening of schools , but it is a real worry list for me about how we understand the impact on the mental health and well-being of children and young people , and to move forwards , that we do n't end up with an entire generation of children and young people who grow up with a range of damage because we have n't thought about what that will look like . So , the mental health recovery plan will of course be of very real importance to me . In amongst all the other priorities I have , I 'm certainly not going to allow the mental health and well-being of children and young people to be forgotten . Sian Gwenllian AM : And how does the current capacity in terms of child and adolescent mental health services compare to service capacity prior to the coronavirus outbreak in Wales ? Have you had to shift some resources over from CAMHS , for example , in order to deal with more general aspects of coronavirus ? Vaughan Gething AM : No , we 've actually got— . Maybe perhaps it might be helpful , Chair , if Tracey Breheny could say something about the way that we 're monitoring the impact we have , in terms of we 've got a reporting tool , but also weekly contact with leads in CAMHS services . Lynne Neagle AM : Tracey . Tracey Breheny : Of course . Thanks , Minister . Yes , on that question , we moved pretty quickly at the beginning of the pandemic phase to put in place , as the Minister said , a weekly monitoring tool of all local health boards , so through that tool , we look at that every week in terms of collecting information . Whilst national reporting 's been stood down , we are picking up assurance through that tool on things like staff sickness in CAMHS services , referral numbers and so on , so we do have that tool in place , and at the moment , that 's telling us that the system can meet the capacity ; has the capacity to meet need . Sian Gwenllian AM : Have CAMHS staff been shifted over to do other work during this virus outbreak ? Tracey Breheny : There has been some movement , as I 'm saying , around health boards , particularly where in the first phase of the epidemic the concentration was on in-patient provision , providing critical care , but my understanding is from the latest tool that we looked at last week , those staff are gradually not just returning to work from self-isolation or whatever , or from different parts of the system . Sian Gwenllian AM : And then , what about the capacity for CAMHS primary mental health services ? Has there been a reduction in that capacity since the beginning of the pandemic in terms of in-patients ? Because that 's what I 'm hearing , that there has been such a reduction , but how are those patients then treated and served ? Tracey Breheny : In terms of in-patient capacity , that is in the system in both the north Wales and in the south Wales unit at the moment . There were some discharges of young people , but we 've had the assurance that that was only undertaken where it was clinically safe to do so and where the community support was in place . Sian Gwenllian AM : And finally in this section from me , given that schools are of course closed and that schools are so very important in terms of signposting young people towards services , how can young people access appropriate services—online services , for example ? How are they signposted towards those services at the moment ? Vaughan Gething AM : Well , we 've not closed off general practice and , as you know , we 've expanded the ability for people to access services in an online manner . We 've expanded a range of telephone advice services , so the telephone advice service we already provide , we 've made sure that 's maintained , and both myself and the deputy Minister have referred to that on a number of occasions . I think the real struggle and the real difficulty is actually how you punch through different messages when the broader news agenda is so overwhelmingly focused on headline messages in other areas . That is , again , a worry for me , but the communications we have within the health and care system , people should know where to refer people to and how to provide access to both telephone and online support that continues to be available , and actually , as I say , we 've expanded that right across our healthcare system . That 's what I ’ m keen to see continue into the future . Whatever the post-COVID-19 world is , I do n't want to miss out on the progress we have made in the online provision of services . Of course , most children and young people expect to be able to access services in an online manner already . Sian Gwenllian AM : But , of course , there will be some who are missed ; they may fall between two stools because they won ’ t know where to turn . Vaughan Gething AM : Yes , and that , again , comes back to our challenge of how we help children and young people in their context , with their families , to know where support and advice and guidance is . Many people are defaulting to their general practitioner if they ca n't find advice somewhere else , so that 's why there 's the information we 're providing through general practice to signpost people , so those pathways haven ’ t been closed off . It 's about making sure that people have alternative means that they ’ re prepared to use at this point in time . If we go back to where we started this evidence session , we were talking about the difficulty of families who do n't want to engage in a traditional person-to-person contact or being in the same room as someone else or allowing people into their home . So , there 's a real challenge about how we make the service available , but then encourage people to take it up , so that we don ’ t see much greater harm that we have to try and resolve at a later point . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . I 've got a supplementary from Suzy Davies , and can I remind Ministers about concise answers , please ? Suzy . Suzy Davies AM : Yes , thank you . Just as we 're speaking about children and young people 's mental health , I wonder if you can confirm whether you 've seen the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 's reports about what they call the grave physical and psychological effect on children and young people , and whether the operational guidance you 've given out is responding to that in any way , or maybe there was something in that that you hadn ’ t thought of and you can respond to as we go along .

Query : What did the group talk about the evaluations on the increasing suicide crimes during the COVID-19 and the long-term special care for the pregnant women ? Vaughan Gething AM : I , personally , have n't read that advice , but the Government 's already concerned about the direct physical and mental health impact of lockdown restrictions . You do n't need to be a parent to recognise that that ’ s a potential issue for children and young people . But , I 'm sure— . I have n't read it , but that 's been signposted , so I can check with officials if they have and if that would change the advice and the position that we 're already adopting , because we do regularly look at a range of advice from a range of sources , including the UN , the World Health Organization and others . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , and we are going to come onto children 's rights . But , as you know , Minister , the prevention of young suicide is a cause that is very close to my heart . Can I ask what assessment the Welsh Government has made of an increase in suicide amongst children and young people during this pandemic and because of this pandemic ? Vaughan Gething AM : Apart from the general concern that I 've expressed on mental health generally , we are already investigating , we 're having a— . We 've commissioned , through the Government , the delivery unit to work with the national advisory group , including Dr Ann John and other people , to review the current , unexpected deaths during the start of the pandemic here in Wales , because we want to try to understand the wider concerns about the potential effects of the restrictions on the mental health and well-being of children and young people , and if that is leading to a spike in suicide or not . So , that 's why we 've commissioned that review to be carried out with the current numbers of unexpected deaths that we have , so we 're able then to provide a report to understand where we are . My understanding is that we should have a report on that review before the end of this month and , obviously , I know the committee ’ s got an interest , so if it 's helpful we can write to you once we 've had a chance to receive the report and to look at it . Lynne Neagle AM : Yes , please . Thank you . In terms of provision of crisis care , then , how has that been impacted by the pandemic ? Are those crisis services available for children and young people who need them at the moment ? Vaughan Gething AM : Yes , they continue to be available . We still have seven-day-a-week crisis care . We 've made clear that mental health services , including those for children and young people , are essential services to be provided . They 're not services to be scaled down . They were not part of the series of measures that I stopped within the health service on 13 March . We have built up those crisis care services over a period of time , and the last thing we want to see is to see them disappear during this period of time when there are well-understood concerns about emotional and mental health . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay , thank you . Moving on to perinatal mental health , this morning I hosted a round-table with the NSPCC where we heard about lots of good practice that 's going on in terms of supporting new mothers and their families in this period , but I wonder if you can tell the committee what you are doing as a Government to make sure that there is consistent perinatal support for all women across Wales in what is a difficult time for any new mother , let alone in a pandemic . Vaughan Gething AM : We continue , again , to provide our perinatal mental health service . That 's not been stopped either . We 've also been looking at how that 's provided on a phone or online basis where possible , because again the same concerns exist about physical contact with people . So , we 're looking to make sure that the progress is n't lost that we 've made . We know there is more to go . So , the service may have changed , but it still absolutely exists . And again , part of the challenge in all of this is about the pause or the interruption in work to create the in-patient capacity that I 've previously committed to . So , I want to understand what that really means , but again the problem is , at this point in the pandemic , I ca n't give you an answer about what that means for that in-patient provision . We 're still committed to it , but I 'm concerned about the time frame—that is partly about the length and the extent . But again , I 'm really impressed by the continuing commitment of our staff to deliver this service for women in what is a particularly uncertain time . It 's difficult enough in terms of the challenge in terms of perinatal mental health in normal times , about people being prepared to come forward and then receiving the sort of response they 'd want , and even more so now . Lynne Neagle AM : Is the Welsh Government aware that there 's apparently been a decrease in the numbers of women being willing to look at mother and baby unit provision , and will you be taking that into account in your planning ? Because , obviously , we would n't want people to think that was because of a lack of need ; it 's down to fear and the lockdown . Vaughan Gething AM : Yes , we 're aware there 's been a reduction in people wanting to make use of the service—or being prepared to make use of the service is probably a better phrase—because we know that 's the same with a range of other areas . There are n't fewer people having strokes than there were at this period of time last year ; the reason why the figures are different is the way that people are behaving because of their concerns about coronavirus . So , I certainly would n't be using this period of time to plan for the need that exists for a facility that we want to create . So , I 'm happy to give that assurance , Chair . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . The next questions are from Suzy Davies .

Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . The next questions are from Suzy Davies . 
Query : Summarize the problem of the priority for the vulnerable children and adequate social support for those who were in foster . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you very much . The next questions , then , are from Dawn Bowden on safeguarding and child protection . Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you , Chair , and thank you , Deputy Minister , because one of the questions I was going to ask was around some of the work that you 've been doing with the third sector on safeguarding and child protection , and I think you 've covered that . But what I 'm particularly keen to find out is how you 're monitoring the impact of coronavirus on child protection and safeguarding in the round . I know the health Minister raised this as a concern in Plenary only recently , and it 's really how we are monitoring it , what concerns have been identified , and how we 're going to start to tackle some of those . Julie Morgan AM : Yes . Thank you very much , Dawn , for that question . Obviously , it is difficult to monitor if there 's not easy access to the children that we 're referring to , and that 's why we have been trying to encourage the vulnerable children to go into school or childcare settings . And there 's been a lot of encouragement for that happen . The Minister , the director of education and the director of social services sent out a joint letter recently to all the local authorities , asking them to try to encourage the vulnerable children and the families to get the children to go to school . In fact , we 've now got 890 vulnerable children attending school settings , and that 's the highest number that we 've had at all since the opening of the scheme . But it 's still only a tiny drop in the ocean . But it 's very good , and it is progress that the numbers attending are now going up . But , of course , there are a lot of children who are not attending school and the social services are not necessarily seeing . There has been a drop in safeguarding referrals to social services . Those numbers are now beginning to go up , but there certainly was a significant drop , which is a great deal of concern . One local authority , in fact , reported a drop of 27 per cent in terms of safeguarding referrals compared to this time last year . So , I issued a written statement on 1 May , setting out the work taken forward under our cross-departmental vulnerable children , young people and safeguarding work stream , and encouraging people to report any safeguarding concerns there are . Because , obviously , we are dependent on the public authorities—you know , schools and health services—to report any concerns , and at the moment , obviously , they 're not there to report them . So , we have made this public appeal for everyone to look out for each other , and I was very interested in what Siân Gwenllian told me about what was being done in Anglesey in terms of sending out a message via social media to get people to look and listen , and to raise their concerns , because , obviously , safeguarding is the concern of everybody in the community . But I think that we are reassured in terms of our contact with the local authorities that they are , in fact , keeping close touch , as far as they possibly can , with all the children that are vulnerable . For those where it is very critical , face-to-face contact is still taking place , and there are imaginative ways of trying to keep in touch with all the other children and families . So , it is a difficult situation and we are concerned about it , but I think as much as possible is being done . Lynne Neagle AM : Jean , you wanted to come in on that . Professor Jean White : Just to add to what the Deputy Minister was saying , the health visiting service has not been stopped or stepped back . It has consolidated some of the ways that it does the Healthy Child Wales Programme , but , for those families that are identified as having particular need or have children that are particularly vulnerable , all the normal contacts have been maintained , so they 're not unseen to the normal health visiting service . That covers both Flying Start and general health visiting areas . Thank you . Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you , Jean , for that , and , Deputy Minister , would there be any value at this point in actually revisiting the current Welsh Government definition and guidance around vulnerable children , in terms of who we identify as vulnerable ? Because this opens up a whole new group of children that are not necessarily known to services but can still be vulnerable . So , it 's just looking at the current guidance that we have . Do you think that needs revisiting at all ? Julie Morgan AM : The definition of vulnerable children and young people includes those with a social worker and with statements of special educational needs , and the most vulnerable of these should be prioritised . But we have now looked at this again , and we 've set out an expanded definition , and we intend to publish that this week . This does include discretion for local authorities to have some flexibility and to be able to offer a place for those who may be on the edge of receiving care and support if they are known to be vulnerable by the school or by family support services . Because , obviously , the children that we know about , we know about , but there are those other children who may be on the edge of care—the children that we 've been trying very hard , as part of our policies in the Welsh Government , to keep with their families , with a lot of support . Those are the ones that we also want to support . So , we are giving discretion to the local authorities in order to have a degree of flexibility , and that will be published this week . Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you . Thank you , Chair . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . We 're going to move on now , then , to talk about looked-after children and children on the edge of care , with questions from Janet Finch-Saunders . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you , Chair . Can you set out the impact the coronavirus emergency has had on the care system , including edge-of-care services , and where have there been areas of concern ? Julie Morgan AM : Well , local authorities have obviously had to change their working practices in response to the COVID emergency , so a red-amber-green rating risk assessment was adopted by all local authorities at the start of the pandemic to ensure that vulnerable children and families receive the right way of receiving services and the frequency of contact from the services . This is being dealt with on a case-by-case basis , so every case that is known is being RAG rated and services are being linked to that . Also , there is very close contact between Welsh Government officials and the local authorities . There are weekly meetings between officials and the heads of the children 's services . I ca n't speak too highly , really , about the amount of support and mutual work that has been going on . We 've been assured that there have been no significant increases in the numbers of looked-after children , and the number of placement breaks are minimal . The other interesting good point is the children services workforce remains at 90 per cent plus , and , obviously , that is a great testimony to the dedication of the workforce . So , there 's very close contact . The children are all being monitored individually , and I think in the circumstances we 're all doing what we possibly can . I know that Albert Heaney is able , probably , to respond in more detail to the contacts , if you 'd like to have that . Lynne Neagle AM : I think we 'll move on to the next section . Can I remind everyone again : sharp focused questions and concise answers ? Janet . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thanks . How is Welsh Government ensuring that vulnerable children have access to the necessary technology to maintain contact with their social workers and other support workers and networks ? Julie Morgan AM : It is normal practice to ensure that children and families do have appropriate access to technology to keep in touch with social workers , so that is part of our normal practice . We 're very keen as a Welsh Government that no children are left behind in their education during this period . So , last month , as you will know , the Minister for Education announced £3 million of funding to help digitally excluded learners so that they 've got access to the internet , so that they can fully participate in online learning . So , we do normally ensure that they 've got digital contact for social workers . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you . Can you set out the picture regarding children 's residential care ? What are the challenges these care settings are facing , and have any children 's homes closed ? Julie Morgan AM : Residential children 's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues , and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened . So , I 'm very pleased to report that . We obviously expect all children in residential care to be supported , and to keep contact with their families and with their siblings , and that is going on , although it may be by technology rather than face to face . We know that some young people have found the social distancing a challenge , and I think it ’ s easy for us to understand that they have found that quite difficult . So , there have been a few issues related to that , but , where that has happened , local authorities have been able to resolve that on a case-by-case basis , and really there are not any major issues . In terms of residential care , Hillside is functioning well—no reporting issues . The staffing levels are normal . There are fewer children and young people there , so , in fact , there 's been an opportunity to give a great deal of attention to the children , and I think we 've had very good reports about how that has happened . So , I am absolutely reassured by our officials here that everything is as well as it could be . I also meet with the children 's commissioner once a week , who is an independent source , and she said when I met her last week , 'Well , as far as we know , it 's all good news ' . So , I do n't think we have any concerns at the moment about the residential care . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Okay . Moving on to foster care , how is Welsh Government working with local authorities to meet the challenges set out by the Association of Fostering and Adoption Cymru and its fostering guidelines ? Julie Morgan AM : We have worked with the fostering organisations . We have had close communications with them , and we 've supported AFA Cymru to develop guidance for foster carers , and that guidance has been very strongly welcomed across the sector . We 're working with the third sector . I think I mentioned before specific issues such as support for fostering services and , of course , care leavers . The Fostering Network has extended its helpline hours , and , of course , Voices from Care—I mentioned them before—have developed this particular offer of support for care leavers . I 've been reassured , as well , from Voices from Care that the young people appear to be more stable now—that they have contact with . But that 's online help for them . So , we have had quite a lot of contact with the fostering services . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : So , the final point on that , then : the Fostering Network and others , as you know , have called for foster parents who can temporarily no longer foster due to the current virus emergency to be paid a retainer , with all foster carers receiving extra financial support for additional expenses . What is your position on this , please ? Julie Morgan AM : Well , we have n't had any specific representations from local authorities asking for support for foster carers , but some local authorities have paid retainers and some people , I believe , have increased the amount of money that they are paying . They 've also given support for various activities and things—have helped sometimes , I think , with broadband access and that sort of issue . And , obviously , foster carers who do require additional support should be approaching their local authorities or the independent fostering agency . Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay . Thank you . Albert , I just wanted to check there was n't anything you wanted to add , please . Albert Heaney : Thank you very much , Chair . I think the only thing to add was relating to monitoring . The Minister has indicated that we are speaking weekly with heads of children 's services , and we do now have a data collection that 's been implemented to capture the critical data in relation to the children 's services . So , that will assist us in our monitoring arrangements going forward . Thank you , Chair . 
Query : What did Julie Morgan think of the monitoring system for the vulnerable children when discussing the priority to care for them ? Dawn Bowden AM : Thank you , Chair , and thank you , Deputy Minister , because one of the questions I was going to ask was around some of the work that you 've been doing with the third sector on safeguarding and child protection , and I think you 've covered that . But what I 'm particularly keen to find out is how you 're monitoring the impact of coronavirus on child protection and safeguarding in the round . I know the health Minister raised this as a concern in Plenary only recently , and it 's really how we are monitoring it , what concerns have been identified , and how we 're going to start to tackle some of those . Julie Morgan AM : Yes . Thank you very much , Dawn , for that question . Obviously , it is difficult to monitor if there 's not easy access to the children that we 're referring to , and that 's why we have been trying to encourage the vulnerable children to go into school or childcare settings . And there 's been a lot of encouragement for that happen . The Minister , the director of education and the director of social services sent out a joint letter recently to all the local authorities , asking them to try to encourage the vulnerable children and the families to get the children to go to school . In fact , we 've now got 890 vulnerable children attending school settings , and that 's the highest number that we 've had at all since the opening of the scheme . But it 's still only a tiny drop in the ocean . But it 's very good , and it is progress that the numbers attending are now going up . But , of course , there are a lot of children who are not attending school and the social services are not necessarily seeing . There has been a drop in safeguarding referrals to social services . Those numbers are now beginning to go up , but there certainly was a significant drop , which is a great deal of concern . One local authority , in fact , reported a drop of 27 per cent in terms of safeguarding referrals compared to this time last year . So , I issued a written statement on 1 May , setting out the work taken forward under our cross-departmental vulnerable children , young people and safeguarding work stream , and encouraging people to report any safeguarding concerns there are . Because , obviously , we are dependent on the public authorities—you know , schools and health services—to report any concerns , and at the moment , obviously , they 're not there to report them .

Query : What did Julie Morgan elaborate on their work with the foster organizations when talking about the adequate social support for those children who were in foster ? Janet Finch-Saunders AM : Thank you . Can you set out the picture regarding children 's residential care ? What are the challenges these care settings are facing , and have any children 's homes closed ? Julie Morgan AM : Residential children 's homes are not really reporting any particularly difficult issues , and certainly they have been able to resolve any issues that have happened .

Query : Summarize their evaluations on the legitimacy of the children 's rights , protection and demands . Lynne Neagle AM : Okay . Thank you very much . And the next questions , then , are from Suzy Davies . Suzy Davies AM : Thank you , Chair . I just wanted to have a quick answer from probably the Minister , I think , about the primary legislation and the regulations that followed , about which children 's rights impact assessments have been done . Have any been done , and can they be shared with the committee if they have ? Sorry , Deputy Minister—my mistake . Julie Morgan AM : Well , it 's been a very difficult time , as you appreciate , in terms of having to make legislation very quickly , and it has n't been possible to do the impact assessments that we would normally do . However , I am very pleased to say that we 're actually launching a survey of children . We 're going to be launching it next week . And this is to try to get from children their views of what 's happened , what we 've been doing , and their views on the whole COVID-19 situation . So , we 're doing this in conjunction with the children 's commissioner and with Young Wales and with the Youth Parliament . So , this is an online survey that we hope will be going out to thousands of children , and we will get their response in terms of what are the important issues that have arisen for them , what they feel about what 's happened during this period , what they feel about the way that we 've dealt with the schools , the way that they 've had to cope in not going school and being at home for so long . And so we 're trying to get feedback from young people . So , I 'm very pleased that we 're doing that , but , in terms of an impact assessment , it has been very difficult , as I 'm sure you can imagine , to be able to do those at these times . I think that Albert wants to come in on that . Suzy Davies AM : Yes , because I 'll pursue that in a sec . Lynne Neagle AM : Albert . Albert Heaney : Thank you . Thank you , Chair , and I think Nicola indicated before me , so apologies , Nicola . Just to say for the committee , really importantly , that we have n't introduced any easements in relation to children 's services legislation . I think that 's really quite crucial . So , from a Welsh context , the standards that are in place do remain , so therefore there would n't have been a necessity for us to do a children 's rights impact assessment in relation to the primary legislation . I think that 's particularly a strong point to us in Wales , both in terms of safeguarding arrangements , but also ensuring that children 's rights are protected at a crucial time . Lynne Neagle AM : Thank you . Nicola . Nicola Edwards : Thanks . In terms of childcare and education , we 're obviously looking at the provisions under the coronavirus Act to allow us to maybe ease some of the statutory requirements , and we are going to be undertaking a full suite of impact assessments on those . Obviously , the coronavirus Act itself was UK Government legislation and they ran their own impact assessments , but , in terms of how we implement it in the childcare and education space—and I think Albert was just saying the same thing—we definitely will be looking at those impacts in terms of going forward . Suzy Davies AM : Okay . Well , just to come back on that then , are you saying to me that , as a result of the various coronavirus regulations that we 've had , no assessments for children 's needs have been postponed , cancelled or done very quickly online rather than in person ? Julie Morgan AM : Well , I think , as Albert said , that there was no relaxation of regulation for children 's social care . You know , that's—there have n't been any in Wales . Suzy Davies AM : No , but that 's what— . There 's no relaxation , but what 's happening in practice ? We 're down on staff across all our councils and in our third sectors—who 's doing the children 's needs assessments , particularly for young carers ? Julie Morgan AM : Well , I— . Albert , can you answer that ? Albert Heaney : I think the first thing to say to the committee is that , going back , we took a very strong line at the beginning that we were n't going to introduce easements in requirements to children 's social services . Of course , through the way that practitioners and social work practitioners have to operate , they are having to operate through a different time . So , assessments are still taking place for child protection and safeguarding concerns ; assessments are still taking place , and especially in relation to—as you mentioned—young carers , to support their needs . So , arrangements— [ Inaudible . ] But they 're having to be slightly differently done—so , some of the technology , and keeping in contact and keeping those visits . So , we 've used , for example , the St David 's Day fund to make sure that care leavers are well supported in terms of having contact and are accessible and able to engage as well . So , we 're having to be a little bit more—and social services departments are having to be a little bit more—innovative in the use of technology in the way that they 've engaged as well . But personal visits are taking place , and visits especially , as the Minister mentioned earlier on—they actually individually assess each case to determine the frequency of visits , to make sure that those contacts are maintained with children at a critical time . Suzy Davies AM : Okay . Thank you . I do n't want to take this much further , but personal visits and social distancing could be slightly problematic . I just want to finish with this one question , if I may . We 've had recommendations from the Carers Trust , or Carers Trust Wales . Have they been accepted by Government , and is it those that are driving the agenda of the task and finish group that you announced the other day , Deputy Minister ? Julie Morgan AM : Well , those will certainly be considered by the task and finish group . I 've had a letter from the Carers Trust about those issues , and we are setting up this group , as you know , and we will be looking at those issues in the group . Suzy Davies AM : Okay . Thank you . Any steal on when that might report ? Julie Morgan AM : I do n't have that at the moment . Suzy Davies AM : Okay . Thank you . Lynne Neagle AM : Maybe we could have a note on that , Deputy Minister . Can I just say , we are running short of time ? We did start late , so , if the Ministers are happy , we 'll carry on until 2.10 p.m.—3.10 p.m.—if that 's okay . And the next questions are from Siân Gwenllian . Sian Gwenllian AM : [ Inaudible . ] Lynne Neagle AM : Hold on a sec , Siân , we 've lost translation again . Can we just see what can be done to get the translation back ? Sorry , Siân . Is there anyone who can help with the translation ? There you go , Siân . Thank you . Sian Gwenllian AM : You will know , Deputy Minister—because we have discussed this in private session—my major concerns with regard to the childcare sector , and what kind of childcare sector we will have at the end of this crisis , as families start to return to the workplace . There are still some childcare providers who are falling between the cracks and are n't receiving financial support . Do you agree—are there people who are still not being supported , and why is n't the Welsh Government able to provide that support for everyone in the childcare sector ? Julie Morgan AM : Thank you , Siân , for that question . And I know that we have had a discussion about this before . Basically , we are aware that there are some sectors in the childcare sector that do fall through some of the loops . We have guaranteed that we will pay the money for the childcare offer for three months . So , that is guaranteed to them , and they are able to take advantage of the Government 's job retainer scheme , but that does mean that there is a problem , as I think we 've discussed before , of the double funding issue , and that is something that we have been trying to resolve and there have been discussions with the Treasury in Whitehall about ways forward on this . I 'm going to ask Nicola to come in in a minute , because she 's much more up to date with the discussions about that , but , so far , I do n't think very much progress has been made on that . But we are looking to see if there are any other ways that we can get help to the childcare sector , and I 'm actually following this meeting with a meeting with the Deputy Minister for equality and chief whip , who is responsible for the voluntary sector , because obviously many of the groups that we 're talking about would come under the voluntary sector , because they have voluntary committees , but they fall between many stools , because they rent premises rather than own premises and they do n't have high turnovers that would qualify them for some of these grants . So , perhaps I could ask Nicola to come in to expand on that .

Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Um , well uh what 's pretty standard is uh that it 's { disfmarker } that they 're all pretty uh uh high uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Large . User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . Marketing : A lot { disfmarker } a lot of buttons buttons . User Interface : Um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . Um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . Like there . And uh { disfmarker } Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . And what 's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we do n't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they 're both uh a V_ . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : So it 's it 's not really very uh clear what 's the function of that . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Yeah . So , that 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Can you go back one page ? For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? We do n't have buttons for the menu . User Interface : Uh , well { disfmarker } Project Manager : Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel { gap } . User Interface : Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea . Project Manager : Okay . But { gap } uh { disfmarker } User Interface : So , uh how { disfmarker } Project Manager : You have to put it on the { disfmarker } User Interface : Like this . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Or or this . And that the menu button is okay . Project Manager : Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah , okay . Marketing : Yes . User Interface : Uh , so the { disfmarker } The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one . User Interface : Yeah . Uh , well that 's something to uh think about . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Uh , maybe I 'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it . User Interface : Okay . Marketing : Okay . { vocalsound } User Interface : Um , well I do n't I do n't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it 's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Not too much colours . User Interface : Uh , no . Not too much . Project Manager : No , it 's not flower power . User Interface : But uh { disfmarker } No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh { disfmarker } and { gap } { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : S okay . User Interface : Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : That was that . Project Manager : Thank you . So , you 're next . Industrial Designer : I 'm next , okay . { vocalsound } Yes . No . Here we go . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , Marketing : { gap } Okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I 'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it 's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said . Maybe it 's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you { disfmarker } it 's easier to use or something like that . But that 's just an idea . And then , I 'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it 's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it 's also nice { gap } have it curved . And maybe like it 's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic uh because uh { gap } it wo n't have to burst uh like in the { disfmarker } in one time . And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research . Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It 's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it 's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wan na see the next , uh if you wan na see that channel . And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it 's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that 's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb . And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons Marketing : Hmm . Industrial Designer : uh if you { gap } push uh channel one , you can see channel one . The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people wo n't buy it any more . They have seen enough of it . And you have also advanced um chips . But that 's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive . And maybe it 's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the { disfmarker } for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera . You have any more questions about this ? I think the main thing is we look at the costs . Marketing : Yep . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has . Marketing : Yeah . But , thi i uh { disfmarker } This is with an L_C_D_ ? No , Industrial Designer : Not with an L_C_D_ . Marketing : not . Project Manager : No , is n't . Industrial Designer : No . Project Manager : But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push . Industrial Designer : Yeah . But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher . Project Manager : But then it 's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . If you do n't { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Th then you 'll see it on the television . Project Manager : Hmm , yes . But then . Yeah , then you go one down one up . When you scroll . Industrial Designer : but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it 's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . Yeah Project Manager : but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . Yeah So you may not be uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : No . The television must do that . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control . Project Manager : Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room . And mostly they are smaller . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yes . But that wo n't be a problem . I think . Project Manager : Most the times that are not advanced televisions . Industrial Designer : No , but then we 'll get to the regular uh remote controls . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . But I do n't know uh how much higher . { vocalsound } Marketing : 'Cause it { disfmarker } Project Manager : That 's important . Marketing : I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better . Industrial Designer : That 's true . Marketing : And that might uh bring back the costs uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : But then we 'll { disfmarker } I think we must discuss who { disfmarker } uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ . Project Manager : Yeah . Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : I can uh look on my uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } It 's very important . Industrial Designer : { gap } Uh { disfmarker } Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . Project Manager : Yeah , more expensive . But how much ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Does n't say . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Oh . User Interface : Hmm . Marketing : Huh . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : That 's from my manufacturing division . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : 'Kay . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Well , thank you . Industrial Designer : Yes ? Marketing : My turn ? Project Manager : Next . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Mm . So { disfmarker } So { disfmarker } Yeah . So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . Uh , I did some trend-watching . It 's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . { vocalsound } 'Cause if you do n't , you wo n't sell . So , well how we did do that ? Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . Of course , well known for their uh trend { disfmarker } uh trends . And well , uh what did you find ? Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products . And um , material ? That should feel { disfmarker } have uh a spongy feeling . And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it . Then the old and rich . They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : And um , they also like uh familiar material , uh especially wood . Now , another picture . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : To get a feeling for this . Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . We uh aim at the younger market . So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . However , with trends it 's always if there 's { disfmarker } it 's now . It it it might last one year , and next year it be { disfmarker } uh can be totally different . And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . So , that 's uh one thing to keep in mind . Industrial Designer : Changing covers . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . Any questions ? Industrial Designer : Nope . Project Manager : No . It 's clear . User Interface : No . Project Manager : So now , it 's uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Ah , let 's see . Now , w we have to decide { vocalsound } Well , we have to decide on the concept . So , we have to look at { disfmarker } 'S next . Components and user interface concept . So { disfmarker } Now , we have to make some concept . Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . First , uh user interface . Industrial Designer : Uh , uh-uh . How w how we how we make it ? Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes , a concept on uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Just { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Should n't we first discuss about like what w we all { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , but maybe we can paint it . Uh , what do we want ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , but if I paint with { disfmarker } Project Manager : I 'll paint . Okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : Something like this ? Or { disfmarker } Shapes or { disfmarker } What do we need ? User Interface : Mm , yes . What ? Marketing : Can make several uh concepts . Project Manager : Yes , okay . Marketing : We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : More like something { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah I I I uh { disfmarker } yes . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : M like { disfmarker } Yeah I ca n't dr I ca n't draw it . Project Manager : And you have to . Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I have to . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I 'm not a designer . It 's more { gap } three D_ . Like , um when you have a part here . This is the remote control . And then you have something like th this under it . So , it 's easier to get it like this . User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { gap } User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } It 's like a gun . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : A g { vocalsound } Project Manager : So , it has to be soft ? Marketing : Mm . { gap } . Industrial Designer : And it has to be soft , yeah . Project Manager : Okay . And uh , the buttons ? Industrial Designer : So , you can squeeze in it and { disfmarker } Sorry ? Project Manager : Buttons . Industrial Designer : Buttons on top of it . And here . The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb . Project Manager : { vocalsound } No , it wo n't . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : But but i that 's the only scroll uh button on it then ? Industrial Designer : But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . One till uh uh zero till nine . User Interface : Yeah , okay . Project Manager : But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels . User Interface : But but how { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : And the b Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . How { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Or two buttons . User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : Uh , two scroll uh wheels . Marketing : And i if we go to uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : If uh { disfmarker } 'Kay c If we do { disfmarker } If we use one , then we 'll have just a switch on it , and you 'll just switch it , and now it 's the sound to switch back User Interface : Mm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : That 's th that 's more difficult . Marketing : But if we have uh a me Yeah . Project Manager : It 's better in { disfmarker } Marketing : If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ? Industrial Designer : with the menu uh button . And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . Just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Because uh , from h hundred uh { gap } remote controls , ninety nine have it . Project Manager : But if we do n't have a L_C_D_ we do n't have a menu . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu . Marketing : Uh-uh . Project Manager : Yeah , but { vocalsound } again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : You do n't know . So , there 's no menu . Industrial Designer : I do n't know . It 's like some sort of uh teletext option , but we do n't have teletext . { vocalsound } Project Manager : No . So you ca n't use it . Industrial Designer : And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher . Project Manager : Okay , we make two concepts . One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : 'Kay . But you all like this kind of thing . Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Good concept . But { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : With the scroll button . Project Manager : That 's one . Industrial Designer : And and this one has to be soft . Marketing : Uh-uh . Industrial Designer : And this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . Or some kind of rubber around it . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : It 's one . Two . Number two . User Interface : And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Like uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } { gap } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Ah that 's nice . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Here . Trigger . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : No . { vocalsound } But when you handle it , you put it on and off . User Interface : Just to uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : It 's not good to use . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , but { vocalsound } I 'll zap . User Interface : Oh , like a { vocalsound } { gap } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Fuck . Out . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : No , it 's not good . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Now , second concept . One with L_C_D_ , one without L_C_D_ . Then uh { disfmarker } Paint it . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Paint it ? Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : With the scroll thing on , like this ? Project Manager : One with two scroll buttons and one with without . Yeah . Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . Industrial Designer : So ? Project Manager : And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Draw it . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Unbelievable . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Do I have to do everything . Blank . You have { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Not so difficult . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . User Interface : But if you put { disfmarker } push the the menu button { disfmarker } Project Manager : Uh , that 's the menu . There for the L_C_D_ screen . User Interface : Yeah , wh what { disfmarker } Yes , but you do n't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . Project Manager : You have to { disfmarker } For the menu . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . One that way . And one that way . So { disfmarker } Then it depends on the cost . S On and off . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : But is it easy to use ? When you have it on your left side , and { disfmarker } Project Manager : When it 's not too big . Just like a a phone . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : M uh yeah , maybe it 's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um Industrial Designer : Separate , more separate , h yeah . Marketing : more separate , yeah . Project Manager : Yes , okay . Marketing : Like , you have the menu button in between uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button . But would it be easy to use then ? If it 's like { disfmarker } { vocalsound } you have a big uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Very good . Is it better ? When you uh { gap } the menu , you have to go there there there there . Industrial Designer : I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : They were like round curves , uh different uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , okay . That 's that 's the outside . But now the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Okay , okay , okay . Project Manager : First the buttons . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Think we have we have now two buttons missing . The uh um { disfmarker } The mute button . Project Manager : Sorry ? Marketing : We have two buttons missing . The mute button . And um , the { disfmarker } to to uh { disfmarker } have to uh { disfmarker } numbers Project Manager : Mute . And the other . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Not so difficult . Marketing : { vocalsound } But , uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh are n't easy to handle . Project Manager : But how do you wan na solve it ? Industrial Designer : With the switch button . Project Manager : Yeah but on the menu that 's not uh easy . Industrial Designer : No Project Manager : Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down . Industrial Designer : like uh { disfmarker } Oh , you mean like that . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh , then you can also have like uh th um { disfmarker } Project Manager : A joystick . Industrial Designer : Yeah , and joystick , I think . Project Manager : Yeah . But is it uh { disfmarker } Does that break , a joystick ? Or a small one just like in a laptop . Industrial Designer : Yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . A little bit bigger , with easier thi Project Manager : Mean , it 's better . But how expensive it is ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I do n't know . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Oh . Why do I pay you for ? { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Um , well { vocalsound } um { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Better ideas . { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : Or no scroll uh things . Just a shape . And { disfmarker } { gap } No , no . It wo n't work . Project Manager : For the young peoples I think scroll button 's good . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Uh-huh . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Think we have to keep them . Industrial Designer : Or a remote control more like joystick . Project Manager : Yeah , but is it { disfmarker } That 's not expensive than uh { disfmarker } Joystick is better . A small one . Industrial Designer : A small one like this , like a Nintendo uh k Project Manager : No just like in a Industrial Designer : Playstation thing . Project Manager : a laptop . Small , round . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Then it 's not so big . Industrial Designer : No , no , no . I mean the the shape of the remote control . Project Manager : Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Just like a Playstation thing . Yeah . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Maybe , if it 's possible , { vocalsound } it 's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : A small one . So , please look at it . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } No , that 's okay , I got { disfmarker } Marketing : And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? Uh , it costs extra ? Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } they 're not uh in details . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : It 's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah we { disfmarker } I think you get it . So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { gap } Then I have to come with it . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : I got my personal costs . I I do n't I do n't know the costs . Project Manager : Your problem . Not mine . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Then I 'll uh make something up . Project Manager : Okay . So , do we have other concepts ? Then for the components , we use a normal battery . Then it 's { disfmarker } Ch cheapest way , I think . User Interface : Mm , yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . Project Manager : No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . Industrial Designer : Yeah , I think it 's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah . Project Manager : So we use a normal battery . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : Yes . Project Manager : Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : Depends on the scroll . Project Manager : Scroll . Industrial Designer : If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we do n't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : And that 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : And uh , we { disfmarker } If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to Industrial Designer : Uh the most expensive . Project Manager : Yes , okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll . Industrial Designer : If we { disfmarker } Yeah . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : If we { disfmarker } No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip . Project Manager : Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and { disfmarker } But , it has to be small . I think . Industrial Designer : Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ? Project Manager : If you have pistol , it { disfmarker } L_C_D_ 's not easy . Y y { vocalsound } Yeah but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Just use your thumb . Project Manager : If you use a phone . Industrial Designer : If you { disfmarker } Yeah . I use my thumb . Project Manager : { gap } k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen . Industrial Designer : If you have a joystick on { disfmarker } No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It 's not just uh { vocalsound } straight . Project Manager : No . No , no . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } That 's how we use it . That 's why they make joysticks like that , I think . Marketing : Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah , but then you look forward . Marketing : Uh , yeah , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : And then you can y Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Project Manager : N well , if you have to look at it . Marketing : If you { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : 'Kay . Here 's our designer . Marketing : If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Then it goes like this . Industrial Designer : Yeah , why not . Project Manager : If th n well { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : It 's for the younger people . Project Manager : Yes , of course . Industrial Designer : It 's something new . { vocalsound } Project Manager : That 's good good . User Interface : It 's uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : But the { disfmarker } um , it may not break . Industrial Designer : Now we put uh rubber around it . Project Manager : Okay . If that 's possible . Marketing : Um , Yeah . Industrial Designer : Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber . Marketing : { gap } Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Or you can uh turn it inside . Marketing : { gap } I ca n't see the { gap } . But , uh the easy of { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : But that 's { disfmarker } Marketing : uh , th the ease of use was n't uh the most important uh aspect of it . Industrial Designer : Huh . User Interface : No , that 's true . Marketing : Uh , for us it 's about to sell it . Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah of course . Industrial Designer : This is something new . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So , Industrial Designer : Costs are okay . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } um we have one minute . User Interface : { vocalsound } { gap } . Marketing : { vocalsound } One . Project Manager : I think . No . Marketing : No . You have more . Project Manager : More . Seven . Marketing : You have still ten . Project Manager : Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up . Industrial Designer : Oh , that 's us together . Project Manager : You two stay here . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Paint it . User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : Now you have to . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : I think it 's clear . Check your mail . So { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yes . Project Manager : It has to be ready in the next meeting . So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : Cookie . Marketing : What ? Okay . Project Manager : Next meeting is called the detailed design . So { disfmarker } Everyth everything has to be ready . Thanks for your attention . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : 'Kay . Marketing : See you at the next meeting . Industrial Designer : Bye bye . 
Query : What did User Interface say about the interface concept design ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Yes , well uh let 's uh talk about the interface uh concept . Uh , first I 'll uh I 'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences . { vocalsound } Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine . Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display . Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Um , well uh what 's pretty standard is uh that it 's { disfmarker } that they 're all pretty uh uh high uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Large . User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . Marketing : A lot { disfmarker } a lot of buttons buttons . User Interface : Um , power buttons are mostly at the top uh left or right . Um , well we see the the the same uh arrows . Like there . And uh { disfmarker } Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue . And what 's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we do n't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they 're both uh a V_ . 
Query : How did User Interface answer Project Manager 's question about the icon design on the buttons ? User Interface : Uh , so the { disfmarker } The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one . User Interface : Yeah . Uh , well that 's something to uh think about . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Uh , maybe I 'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it . User Interface : Okay . Marketing : Okay . { vocalsound } User Interface : Um , well I do n't I do n't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it 's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Not too much colours . User Interface : Uh , no . Not too much . Project Manager : No , it 's not flower power . User Interface : But uh { disfmarker } No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh { disfmarker } and { gap } { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : S okay . User Interface : Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion . 
Query : Summarize the discussion about interface concept design . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yes , well uh let 's uh talk about the interface uh concept . Uh , first I 'll uh I 'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences . { vocalsound } Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off .

But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they 're both uh a V_ . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : So it 's it 's not really very uh clear what 's the function of that . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Yeah . So , that 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Can you go back one page ? For the uh menu , what do we use for that ? We do n't have buttons for the menu . User Interface : Uh , well { disfmarker } Project Manager : Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel { gap } . User Interface : Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea . Project Manager : Okay . But { gap } uh { disfmarker } User Interface : So , uh how { disfmarker } Project Manager : You have to put it on the { disfmarker } User Interface : Like this . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Or or this . And that the menu button is okay . Project Manager : Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah , okay . Marketing : Yes . User Interface : Uh , so the { disfmarker } The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one . User Interface : Yeah . Uh , well that 's something to uh think about . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Uh , maybe I 'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it . User Interface : Okay . Marketing : Okay . { vocalsound } User Interface : Um , well I do n't I do n't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case . Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it 's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Not too much colours . User Interface : Uh , no . Not too much . Project Manager : No , it 's not flower power . User Interface : But uh { disfmarker } No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh { disfmarker } and { gap } { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : S okay . User Interface : Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh opinion . 
Query : What did Industrial Designer say about the customers ' taste ? Industrial Designer : Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , Marketing : { gap } Okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I 'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it 's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said . Maybe it 's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you { disfmarker } it 's easier to use or something like that . But that 's just an idea . And then , I 'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket . Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it 's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it 's also nice { gap } have it curved . And maybe like it 's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic uh because uh { gap } it wo n't have to burst uh like in the { disfmarker } in one time . And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research . Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It 's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it 's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wan na see the next , uh if you wan na see that channel . And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it 's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that 's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb . And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons Marketing : Hmm . 
Query : What did the team discuss about the use of advanced chips and LCD display ? Industrial Designer : uh if you { gap } push uh channel one , you can see channel one . The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people wo n't buy it any more . They have seen enough of it . And you have also advanced um chips . But that 's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive . And maybe it 's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the { disfmarker } for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera . You have any more questions about this ? I think the main thing is we look at the costs . Marketing : Yep . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has . Marketing : Yeah . But , thi i uh { disfmarker } This is with an L_C_D_ ? No , Industrial Designer : Not with an L_C_D_ . Marketing : not . Project Manager : No , is n't . Industrial Designer : No . Project Manager : But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons . Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push . Industrial Designer : Yeah . But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher . Project Manager : But then it 's not easy to use scroll uh wheel . If you do n't { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Th then you 'll see it on the television . Project Manager : Hmm , yes . But then . Yeah , then you go one down one up . When you scroll . Industrial Designer : but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it 's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . Yeah Project Manager : but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . Yeah So you may not be uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : No . The television must do that . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our uh remote control . Project Manager : Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room . And mostly they are smaller . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yes . But that wo n't be a problem . I think . Project Manager : Most the times that are not advanced televisions . Industrial Designer : No , but then we 'll get to the regular uh remote controls . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news . 
Query : What did Marketing talk about market trend findings ? Industrial Designer : Uh , uh-uh . How w how we how we make it ? Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes , a concept on uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Just { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Should n't we first discuss about like what w we all { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah , but maybe we can paint it . Uh , what do we want ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , but if I paint with { disfmarker } Project Manager : I 'll paint . Okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : Something like this ? Or { disfmarker } Shapes or { disfmarker } What do we need ? User Interface : Mm , yes . What ? 
Query : What did the team decide on the cost ? Industrial Designer : Or no scroll uh things . Just a shape . And { disfmarker } { gap } No , no . It wo n't work . Project Manager : For the young peoples I think scroll button 's good . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Uh-huh . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Think we have to keep them . Industrial Designer : Or a remote control more like joystick . Project Manager : Yeah , but is it { disfmarker } That 's not expensive than uh { disfmarker } Joystick is better . A small one . Industrial Designer : A small one like this , like a Nintendo uh k Project Manager : No just like in a Industrial Designer : Playstation thing . Project Manager : a laptop . Small , round . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Then it 's not so big . Industrial Designer : No , no , no . I mean the the shape of the remote control . Project Manager : Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Just like a Playstation thing . Yeah . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Maybe , if it 's possible , { vocalsound } it 's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : A small one . So , please look at it . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } No , that 's okay , I got { disfmarker } Marketing : And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? Uh , it costs extra ? Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } they 're not uh in details . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : It 's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah we { disfmarker } I think you get it . So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { gap } Then I have to come with it . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : I got my personal costs . I I do n't I do n't know the costs . Project Manager : Your problem . Not mine . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Then I 'll uh make something up . Project Manager : Okay . So , do we have other concepts ? Then for the components , we use a normal battery . Then it 's { disfmarker } Ch cheapest way , I think . User Interface : Mm , yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . Project Manager : No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . Industrial Designer : Yeah , I think it 's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah . Project Manager : So we use a normal battery . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : Yes . Project Manager : Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : Depends on the scroll . Project Manager : Scroll . Industrial Designer : If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we do n't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : And that 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : And uh , we { disfmarker } If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to Industrial Designer : Uh the most expensive . Project Manager : Yes , okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll . Industrial Designer : If we { disfmarker } Yeah . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : If we { disfmarker } No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip . Project Manager : Okay . So , uh the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ and { disfmarker } But , it has to be small . I think . Industrial Designer : Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ? Project Manager : If you have pistol , it { disfmarker } L_C_D_ 's not easy . Y y { vocalsound } Yeah but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Just use your thumb . Project Manager : If you use a phone . Industrial Designer : If you { disfmarker } Yeah . I use my thumb . Project Manager : { gap } k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen . Industrial Designer : If you have a joystick on { disfmarker } No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It 's not just uh { vocalsound } straight . Project Manager : No . No , no . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } That 's how we use it . That 's why they make joysticks like that , I think . 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . User Interface : Oops .

Let 's talk about money . User Interface : Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , well . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } According to the drawings . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , you 're { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Not me . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } So . Marketing : So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control . Project Manager : Yeah , mm that 's the price we want to { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Hmm . Project Manager : that 's the aim for the price for the remote control . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : We aim to do { vocalsound } this profit . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } On the international market . Marketing : { vocalsound } 't is big number . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , we 're to sell two million then . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Wow . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm { vocalsound } for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum . { vocalsound } 'Kay { vocalsound } . So any of you have experience in remote controls ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm yeah . Marketing : Uh yes , we have plenty at home . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } In fact , my daughter likes l { vocalsound } { gap } { vocalsound } remote controls . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } That { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm . To eat ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : To eat ? Yeah , mainly , and to break . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } So that could be a great um { vocalsound } application . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Remote controls children proof . Mm mm-hmm . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Yeah . User Interface : Children proof . Marketing : { vocalsound } Ye ye yeah . User Interface : Hmm . Marketing : So she likes uh buttons { vocalsound } which make click , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah , pret Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : so { vocalsound } it has to click . Project Manager : So they have to be waterproof maybe ? Marketing : It has to be uh wha { vocalsound } baby proof { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } 'Cause they eat { disfmarker } she ate it . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : yeah { vocalsound } but mainly it has to be very robust Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : because even if she 's not very tall she 's uh { vocalsound } high enough so that uh when she throw it away it 's uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Ah . Marketing : So it has to be very robust . User Interface : Okay , unbreakable . Marketing : Unbreakable , yeah . User Interface : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Yeah , we have some child lock or something , yeah . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : And uh { vocalsound } it has to be nice looking , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : colourful , maybe { disfmarker } Project Manager : Colourful , yeah mm . User Interface : Colourful ? That 's not practical . Marketing : colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : No , that 's a good idea . Industrial Designer : Yeah , it 's always black or { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : , they 're always black , yeah , Project Manager : Mm mm-mm . User Interface : No . Marketing : but this one could be I dunno , purple or b Project Manager : Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : But how gon na { disfmarker } okay , just uh but it 's uh monochrome it 's n it 's not like { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : No , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : because you think , why not . User Interface : Otherwise you will never find it . Marketing : One colour . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah even we can change colours , no ? Like the uh Marketing : Oh like the phones , Industrial Designer : like the phones and these things we c yeah . Marketing : yeah , it could change colours , yeah . User Interface : Cool . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : At least for children like one colour and { gap } . { vocalsound } User Interface : Ch Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Good idea . Marketing : Good . Industrial Designer : And it should be really { gap } small and { gap } . Project Manager : Small also ? Do n't you think { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Huh not so big like { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : No uh , not too much buttons or { disfmarker } mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , not too much buttons and { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : so y you can decide that now it 's the remote control for the television , then it 's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator Industrial Designer : Uh . Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Yeah , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } whatever { vocalsound } Project Manager : that 's { disfmarker } Marketing : I dunno if it 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Or if we should have a targeted re remote control . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : { vocalsound } So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , Project Manager : So , I think there 's { disfmarker } Marketing : yeah , size matters , yeah . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Colour , { vocalsound } size , sh Project Manager : So you you think it 's better if small than bigger . Industrial Designer : Yeah , maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess . { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm . User Interface : Yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . Okay . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : No , not too small , yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like { gap } . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Hmm . User Interface : Yeah , like a palm sized . Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : Just to hold it . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : But uh what would be different from this , from the others ? I dunno if { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh maybe we can change the colours that { disfmarker } at least the frame . Mm . S so then it depends { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , at least the colour would be different . Industrial Designer : you are to { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame { gap } . Marketing : I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they 're { disfmarker } they never find a good button in the right place . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Marketing : For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : So there 's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , Project Manager : Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um { vocalsound } cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what { disfmarker } Marketing : I dunno { gap } . User Interface : No , Project Manager : no . User Interface : no screens , it 's too complex . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } Too expensive , yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Too expensive for twelve Euro ? User Interface : And n maybe not too expensive , Project Manager : And too expensive . User Interface : well it 's not my problem , but well okay . Marketing : Ah . User Interface : But no screens on remote controls . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Mm-hmm . I thought it could be only a screen { vocalsound } which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , Industrial Designer : Ye yeah . Marketing : so I would have my own design of the remote control because it 's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : if you { disfmarker } if you like . Industrial Designer : I mean it it 's like Marketing : I do n't know if it makes sense , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-mm . Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } it 's like two types no ? { vocalsound } people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you 're right handed you use like this Marketing : Yeah , for instance , mm . User Interface : Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Mm mm mm . Industrial Designer : or { disfmarker } so tha your switch on and off should be on Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : So adaptable { vocalsound } { disfmarker } yeah something { disfmarker } User Interface : Adaptable . Alright , good , Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : Maybe , if if it 's possible , yeah . Project Manager : yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm { vocalsound } User Interface : so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? Industrial Designer : huh . User Interface : On off ? Industrial Designer : Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I 'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations . User Interface : I mean if it 's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a Industrial Designer : Two . Marketing : Three buttons you mean ? User Interface : { vocalsound } like three mental states , Project Manager : Three option . User Interface : yeah you know what I mean , Marketing : Ah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : we can just make it uh Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager : Um . User Interface : controlled by a brain , huh ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Mm-hmm , yeah , sure . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Maybe if it 's more , if there is a software inside Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : that ask you three { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } If it { disfmarker } if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah . User Interface : Sh sure , sure . Marketing : Yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time . Industrial Designer : Mm yeah . Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . Marketing : Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have { disfmarker } you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . Industrial Designer : Mm . Yeah . Project Manager : Mm . { vocalsound } Marketing : And that 's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . { vocalsound } User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : You do this ? Industrial Designer : Yeah { vocalsound } . Marketing : Uh no . User Interface : I usually just change channels . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Because I 'm only using three or four channels but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put { disfmarker } yeah , you can only have one bit . Project Manager : Yeah . I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah . Industrial Designer : Dash . Marketing : And then back to the one I was before , Project Manager : Also we can be here { disfmarker } Marketing : so there 's { disfmarker } whichever it was . User Interface : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Yeah you can Project Manager : yeah , that would be cool . Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } yeah . User Interface : Go back button is good . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Uh uh we had that in in other countries . User Interface : I once had it . Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah , the previous button is { gap } . Project Manager : Mm { vocalsound } yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo { vocalsound } previous of the previous . { vocalsound } User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Uh , okay . { vocalsound } User Interface : History . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Oh { vocalsound } uh { vocalsound } . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Then you can watch what your { disfmarker } ah you could also record your { disfmarker } record your { vocalsound } sequence of actions , Industrial Designer : Uh . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } that becomes more complex , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or { disfmarker } { vocalsound } remote controls . Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah , what the { disfmarker } which channels the viewer { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-mm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . Marketing : maybe it 's a { disfmarker } Project Manager : So I think we have full of idea . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Um we 're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm { vocalsound } work on these ideas and try to make a uh { vocalsound } the ones , { vocalsound } make um { disfmarker } to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we do n't want . { vocalsound } And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do . Um . { vocalsound } So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes . Marketing : So what does M_E_ means ? M_E_ the user requirements ? Or that 's uh that 's for us ? User Interface : Market Expert . Project Manager : Mm . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Marketing { disfmarker } yeah { vocalsound } { gap } . Marketing : Uh that 's me . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Oh , of course { vocalsound } yeah , the user requirement specifications , uh-huh , yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Okay . { vocalsound } I 'll think of that . Project Manager : Mm okay . So . Marketing : So ? Project Manager : I think that 's all . Marketing : Meeting 's over ? Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Okay . Marketing : Great . Industrial Designer : Thank you . Marketing : Thank you . Project Manager : See you in thirty minutes . User Interface : Thank you everybody . 
Query : Summarize the decision of the discussion about the design goal of the remote control . Project Manager : Next . Let 's talk about money . User Interface : Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , well . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } According to the drawings . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , you 're { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Not me . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } So . Marketing : So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control . Project Manager : Yeah , mm that 's the price we want to { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Hmm . Project Manager : that 's the aim for the price for the remote control . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : We aim to do { vocalsound } this profit . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } On the international market . Marketing : { vocalsound } 't is big number . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , we 're to sell two million then . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Wow . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm { vocalsound } for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum . { vocalsound } 'Kay { vocalsound } . So any of you have experience in remote controls ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm yeah . Marketing : Uh yes , we have plenty at home . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } In fact , my daughter likes l { vocalsound } { gap } { vocalsound } remote controls . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } That { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm . To eat ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : To eat ? Yeah , mainly , and to break . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } So that could be a great um { vocalsound } application . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Remote controls children proof . Mm mm-hmm . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Yeah . User Interface : Children proof . Marketing : { vocalsound } Ye ye yeah . User Interface : Hmm . Marketing : So she likes uh buttons { vocalsound } which make click , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah , pret Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : so { vocalsound } it has to click . Project Manager : So they have to be waterproof maybe ? Marketing : It has to be uh wha { vocalsound } baby proof { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } 'Cause they eat { disfmarker } she ate it . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : yeah { vocalsound } but mainly it has to be very robust Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : because even if she 's not very tall she 's uh { vocalsound } high enough so that uh when she throw it away it 's uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Ah . Marketing : So it has to be very robust . User Interface : Okay , unbreakable . Marketing : Unbreakable , yeah . User Interface : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Yeah , we have some child lock or something , yeah . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : And uh { vocalsound } it has to be nice looking , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : colourful , maybe { disfmarker } Project Manager : Colourful , yeah mm . User Interface : Colourful ? That 's not practical . Marketing : colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : No , that 's a good idea . Industrial Designer : Yeah , it 's always black or { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : , they 're always black , yeah , Project Manager : Mm mm-mm . User Interface : No . Marketing : but this one could be I dunno , purple or b Project Manager : Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : But how gon na { disfmarker } okay , just uh but it 's uh monochrome it 's n it 's not like { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : No , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : because you think , why not . User Interface : Otherwise you will never find it . Marketing : One colour . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah even we can change colours , no ? Like the uh Marketing : Oh like the phones , Industrial Designer : like the phones and these things we c yeah . Marketing : yeah , it could change colours , yeah . User Interface : Cool . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : At least for children like one colour and { gap } . { vocalsound } User Interface : Ch Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Good idea . Marketing : Good . Industrial Designer : And it should be really { gap } small and { gap } . Project Manager : Small also ? Do n't you think { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Huh not so big like { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : No uh , not too much buttons or { disfmarker } mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , not too much buttons and { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : so y you can decide that now it 's the remote control for the television , then it 's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator Industrial Designer : Uh . Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Yeah , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } whatever { vocalsound } Project Manager : that 's { disfmarker } Marketing : I dunno if it 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Or if we should have a targeted re remote control . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : { vocalsound } So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , Project Manager : So , I think there 's { disfmarker } Marketing : yeah , size matters , yeah . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Colour , { vocalsound } size , sh Project Manager : So you you think it 's better if small than bigger . Industrial Designer : Yeah , maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess . { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm . User Interface : Yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . Okay . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : No , not too small , yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like { gap } . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Hmm . User Interface : Yeah , like a palm sized . Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : Just to hold it . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : But uh what would be different from this , from the others ? I dunno if { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh maybe we can change the colours that { disfmarker } at least the frame . Mm . S so then it depends { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , at least the colour would be different . Industrial Designer : you are to { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame { gap } . Marketing : I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they 're { disfmarker } they never find a good button in the right place . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Marketing : For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : So there 's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , Project Manager : Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um { vocalsound } cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what { disfmarker } Marketing : I dunno { gap } . User Interface : No , Project Manager : no . User Interface : no screens , it 's too complex . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } Too expensive , yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Too expensive for twelve Euro ? User Interface : And n maybe not too expensive , Project Manager : And too expensive . User Interface : well it 's not my problem , but well okay . Marketing : Ah . User Interface : But no screens on remote controls . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Mm-hmm . I thought it could be only a screen { vocalsound } which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , Industrial Designer : Ye yeah . Marketing : so I would have my own design of the remote control because it 's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : if you { disfmarker } if you like . Industrial Designer : I mean it it 's like Marketing : I do n't know if it makes sense , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-mm . Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } it 's like two types no ? { vocalsound } people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you 're right handed you use like this Marketing : Yeah , for instance , mm . User Interface : Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Mm mm mm . Industrial Designer : or { disfmarker } so tha your switch on and off should be on Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : So adaptable { vocalsound } { disfmarker } yeah something { disfmarker } User Interface : Adaptable . Alright , good , Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : Maybe , if if it 's possible , yeah . Project Manager : yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm { vocalsound } User Interface : so how many actions do we need to implement in it ?

Marketing : It 's good for group spirit . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah that 's it . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } It certainly is . { vocalsound } Project Manager : We 're one big happy family now . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah something like that . Project Manager : Well then uh the serious uh stuff . We 're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros . Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros . So I did n't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell . Industrial Designer : So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } { gap } we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research . Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first { gap } about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera ? Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait . We can uh take notes { vocalsound } and uh { disfmarker } Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ? Please ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well I I did n't have to prepare anything about uh { disfmarker } { gap } Project Manager : No uh I did . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : it 's not , it 's it 's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls , but uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well uh just w we 're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then { disfmarker } Marketing : I think it 's im it 's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control . Project Manager : Yeah yeah . Marketing : On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we 're gon na produce . Project Manager : Yep . That 's alright . Marketing : Maybe it 's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player Project Manager : That would be a nice idea , yes . Marketing : so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control . Project Manager : Yep yep yep . Marketing : Furthermore it 's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to { gap } well fifty million ? Project Manager : Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Yeah yeah User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : so a lot of people have to be able to use it . Industrial Designer : No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh Marketing : So { disfmarker } User Interface : Easy to learn . Marketing : Yeah . Yeah that 's right . Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : I 'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh { disfmarker } well I 'll put it in the project uh folder when I 'm done uh just now . Marketing : Mm-hmm . User Interface : I also think we should not add too many buttons . Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : No that 's right . User Interface : Modern day uh remotes have { vocalsound } too much buttons I think . Project Manager : Y y you do n't use uh the half of them that 's that 's { gap } User Interface : Precisely . Project Manager : culture uh international . Marketing : Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something . Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : Yeah indeed . Industrial Designer : Yeah so it does n't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah right . Project Manager : Yep , and maybe we do uh { vocalsound } we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . Do n't we have uh other uh ou User Interface : Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ? Project Manager : Uh . Industrial Designer : And stereo uh s uh audio installations . Project Manager : We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw . Marketing : Yeah so but th that 's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Yep . User Interface : And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . So we can keep that in mind . Industrial Designer : Most people do , yeah . Project Manager : Well yeah . Industrial Designer : It does n't { gap } Project Manager : It does n't have to be , but we can . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : it does n't have to be { disfmarker } User Interface : W well it 's a n it 's a new remote and you do n't buy a remote if you do n't have anything to uh to control with it . Project Manager : Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_ . Marketing : Yeah but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah alright , but { disfmarker } Marketing : We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah because we look at competitors Industrial Designer : Well . Project Manager : and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : Yeah but it 's { disfmarker } it has to be useable . Industrial Designer : It has to be different and familiar at the same time . Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : Yeah . Yeah Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : { gap } yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing { gap } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : you can make it uh triangle shaped , User Interface : Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : but that 's not uh very recognisable . Marketing : { vocalsound } No . Project Manager : Oo Industrial Designer : Oval ? Project Manager : N we can use uh it as a as a game pad . User Interface : Yeah or so Industrial Designer : I { disfmarker } Project Manager : So { vocalsound } one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : Well yeah it 's new . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } Marketing : { gap } . Not with two hands . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah yeah yeah , right . User Interface : { gap } but young people want something different Marketing : No { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : and it is { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well i we already uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah but it 's quite important that it fits . Project Manager : one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Oh but it ha it has to be m Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : yeah . But you still have to know it 's a remote and not another { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to { disfmarker } we can imagine uh User Interface : Yeah alright . Project Manager : because it 's a long time uh on the market . So the the form will have { vocalsound } been uh tested out so { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful Project Manager : Yes . Well { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : or else uh they would have been ano another shape . Project Manager : for me personally I have a { vocalsound } a lot of remotes uh at home but { vocalsound } those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle { vocalsound } I do n't like to use them . I have uh have to { disfmarker } it has to fit my hands . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : When it falls over it and I just have { disfmarker } and then the button that I use most has to be here . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah Marketing : It should n't be boxy . Industrial Designer : a lo { gap } the long box shape yeah . You have to { vocalsound } use one hand . Project Manager : It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with { gap } thumb . Marketing : Nah { disfmarker } I do n't agree with the long box uh shape { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Why not ? Marketing : it it has to be custom made for the hand . User Interface : Yeah it does n't fit { gap } . Project Manager : Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , Marketing : Yeah but if you shape it { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : but then you have { disfmarker } User Interface : No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ { gap } with their uh remotes { vocalsound } pl players { vocalsound } they they are the new remotes are n't box shaped . Marketing : If { disfmarker } Project Manager : D_V_D_ players . Yes . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : W no w what else ? Marketing : No that 's ol old fashioned . Industrial Designer : I di User Interface : Well { disfmarker } Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ? User Interface : Yes uh { disfmarker } Marketing : I can imagine that us User Interface : Well { vocalsound } most of { gap } of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end . Marketing : Yeah right . It fits in your palms . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Well { vocalsound } User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : but it 's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh { vocalsound } round forms in it to fit your hand , User Interface : Yeah it { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : Hmm ? Project Manager : A it h it has it it has a that 's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . Marketing : Um . Industrial Designer : but it 's it 's still { disfmarker } Yeah yeah al alright Project Manager : That 's { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : but but it 's still it 's still { gap } sort of box , yeah . Marketing : { gap } . User Interface : Yeah yea Industrial Designer : It it has round forms Marketing : { vocalsound } Well { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : but it in the end it 's still the box , so that 's what I mean . Marketing : Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand . Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah I understand , but { disfmarker } no no I do n't mean an entire box like completely square Marketing : It should n't be too boxy , you know . User Interface : Hmm . Marketing : It 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } No no no . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : but a also with round edges of course , User Interface : { gap } . Industrial Designer : but in in in at the end it 's still this long { vocalsound } box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh { vocalsound } to fit . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Right maybe something like this Industrial Designer : Yeah yes { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } and then a button here to switch between { vocalsound } different systems like D_V_D_ player Industrial Designer : I thought about something like that . Yeah . Marketing : and so you can { disfmarker } I 've { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : A big recognisable button on top or something . Marketing : Yeah right , and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : We have five minutes left . Industrial Designer : The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , Marketing : Right . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes Industrial Designer : and uh n uh uh not too close uh together . Project Manager : uh that 's { vocalsound } yep . Marketing : But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . Marketing : So there has to be some space between the buttons . Industrial Designer : Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . Marketing : Yeah . Yeah right right , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : and maybe we should use colours . User Interface : Yeah { gap } maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well { gap } { vocalsound } you can you can put on on them , Industrial Designer : Colours , yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Ha . User Interface : and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs { vocalsound } Marketing : That 's kinda trendy . Yeah right . Project Manager : Sound nice . Yes . User Interface : I dunno but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well it 's just uh about our first ideas now User Interface : Well { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { gap } . Project Manager : so I think individually we 'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Right . But { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes ? Industrial Designer : Already thought about something tha { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } I think it 's uh it 's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make , Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : so we { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well thirty minutes we have . So um { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh . You 'll get specific instructions when you 're back in your room so uh it 's uh logical uh . I think . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : { gap } . Marketing : { vocalsound } No problem . Project Manager : Oh and uh that 's uh that 's all . So we 'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over . Industrial Designer : Yeah now we can still talk about the material , Project Manager : Yeah yes say . User Interface : Mm .

User Interface : we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : { gap } yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing { gap } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : you can make it uh triangle shaped , User Interface : Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : but that 's not uh very recognisable .

Industrial Designer : yeah . But you still have to know it 's a remote and not another { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to { disfmarker } we can imagine uh User Interface : Yeah alright . Project Manager : because it 's a long time uh on the market . So the the form will have { vocalsound } been uh tested out so { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful Project Manager : Yes . Well { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : or else uh they would have been ano another shape . Project Manager : for me personally I have a { vocalsound } a lot of remotes uh at home but { vocalsound } those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle { vocalsound } I do n't like to use them . I have uh have to { disfmarker } it has to fit my hands . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : When it falls over it and I just have { disfmarker } and then the button that I use most has to be here . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah Marketing : It should n't be boxy . Industrial Designer : a lo { gap } the long box shape yeah . You have to { vocalsound } use one hand . Project Manager : It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with { gap } thumb . Marketing : Nah { disfmarker } I do n't agree with the long box uh shape { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Why not ? Marketing : it it has to be custom made for the hand . User Interface : Yeah it does n't fit { gap } . Project Manager : Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , Marketing : Yeah but if you shape it { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : but then you have { disfmarker } User Interface : No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ { gap } with their uh remotes { vocalsound } pl players { vocalsound } they they are the new remotes are n't box shaped . Marketing : If { disfmarker } Project Manager : D_V_D_ players . Yes . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : W no w what else ? Marketing : No that 's ol old fashioned . Industrial Designer : I di User Interface : Well { disfmarker } Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ? User Interface : Yes uh { disfmarker } Marketing : I can imagine that us User Interface : Well { vocalsound } most of { gap } of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end . Marketing : Yeah right . It fits in your palms . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Well { vocalsound } User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : but it 's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh { vocalsound } round forms in it to fit your hand , User Interface : Yeah it { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : Hmm ?

User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : but a also with round edges of course , User Interface : { gap } . Industrial Designer : but in in in at the end it 's still this long { vocalsound } box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh { vocalsound } to fit . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Right maybe something like this Industrial Designer : Yeah yes { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } and then a button here to switch between { vocalsound } different systems like D_V_D_ player Industrial Designer : I thought about something like that . Yeah . Marketing : and so you can { disfmarker } I 've { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : A big recognisable button on top or something . Marketing : Yeah right , and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : We have five minutes left . Industrial Designer : The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , Marketing : Right . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yes Industrial Designer : and uh n uh uh not too close uh together . Project Manager : uh that 's { vocalsound } yep . Marketing : But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . Marketing : So there has to be some space between the buttons . Industrial Designer : Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . Marketing : Yeah . Yeah right right , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : and maybe we should use colours . User Interface : Yeah { gap } maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well { gap } { vocalsound } you can you can put on on them , Industrial Designer : Colours , yeah . Marketing : Yeah .

And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh { vocalsound } to connect things uh to each other . Project Manager : Yeah . Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it 's all about uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I think so .

User Interface : So { disfmarker } I mean , the colours are for young people , Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . User Interface : but Project Manager : Yes . So , I think it 's four . User Interface : older { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Maybe version uh three point O_ uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } has other colours . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Maybe .

Marketing : That 's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um { disfmarker } Yeah . I think if we do this , as it 's uh uh c uh it 's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two . Industrial Designer : Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yes . Two . Project Manager : Uh , I say uh a five . Marketing : Two . Project Manager : It 's not fashion , it 's new . It must be a fashion . But it is n't . Industrial Designer : It { disfmarker } it will be fashion . Project Manager : Yes . It w If it 's not a fashion we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it 's a five . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Okay . User Interface : Then make it th three . Marketing : Okay . Yes , I 'll think of that too . Project Manager : No . Oh . Industrial Designer : 'Kay . Three is okay . Marketing : Yeah , agree ? Project Manager : I use my feet though . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Oh , we 'll wait outside . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } A three . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that 's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five . Industrial Designer : I give it a one . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { gap } . Yes , a one . I like it . Project Manager : Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . { vocalsound } Marketing : We have to do our uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Say two . Marketing : Two or three ? Project Manager : Okay , two . Industrial Designer : Two . Marketing : Two . Okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : So , well we gon na do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . So , um that 's why it 's a negative in it . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to { vocalsound } uh this fashion , I { disfmarker } We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you do n't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two . Industrial Designer : One . Project Manager : { vocalsound } You ? User Interface : One . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Me too . One . Marketing : One . { vocalsound } Um , but { vocalsound } where where is the { gap } ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Next , six . It does not get lost easily . Marketing : So { disfmarker } Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : Yes . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Just a small thing . { vocalsound } Project Manager : No , we did not .

Industrial Designer : Yeah , o one . Project Manager : Okay , a one . Marketing : One . Project Manager : Next . Marketing : Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market .

Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Right . There 's a fancy look-and-feel . Marketing : Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I did n't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ? I would say yes . So um { disfmarker } Well , let 's also give this a two . T Industrial Designer : I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It 's { disfmarker } Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy { gap } trendy . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Yes , a one . Project Manager : I say a two . It 's a a bit personal . If it 's fancy . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : So I think s two is better . User Interface : Yeah , okay . Industrial Designer : Two is okay . Marketing : Okay . Two . Industrial Designer : { gap } . Marketing : And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends . Project Manager : No , it 's new . Innovation . Marketing : If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we did n't uh { disfmarker } We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . Industrial Designer : Oh . Marketing : So , I would { disfmarker } did not give this uh a one or two . I { disfmarker } We 'll go for a three . Project Manager : { gap } . Industrial Designer : I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yes . Industrial Designer : But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It 's also a trend , so I 'll give it a two . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Mm , three . Project Manager : Me too . Three . Marketing : A three . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating . Project Manager : Effort is three , ten and twelve .

Industrial Designer : One . Marketing : One . Project Manager : And it 's not really a s Industrial Designer : Joystick uh thing . Marketing : { gap } . Project Manager : Yeah , it 's this one . Now , uh button supplement . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Special colour . We already { disfmarker } Uh , that 's the { disfmarker } from the { disfmarker } for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour . User Interface : Mm , yeah . Project Manager : So , then uh { disfmarker } then then then then then then { disfmarker } Then { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } We 're not gon na make it . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh , no . It 's too expensive . Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } Wh Project Manager : So , we have to change something . Industrial Designer : What what are the costs ? Project Manager : Fifteen Euros . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Fifteen . Project Manager : Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it 's okay . 'Cause we ca n't lose the battery . We ca n't lose the advanced chip . We ca n't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour . Marketing : { gap } . We would have uh n Industrial Designer : A special colour . Project Manager : Oh , no , we { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh , I do n't think it 's a very special colour . Project Manager : No , it 's uh { disfmarker } Sorry ? Industrial Designer : Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ? Marketing : For a remote control . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } What ? Marketing : I 've { disfmarker } For a remote control , I think it is . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right . Project Manager : Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : And what if we use only one sort of um { disfmarker } Um { vocalsound } just only plastic or only rubber ? Project Manager : That 's one Euro . Industrial Designer : One Euro discount . { vocalsound } Project Manager : So , I do n't think that 's good . Mm { disfmarker } I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left . Project Manager : Yes . Then it 's only thirteen Euros . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } And then we 'll lose fifty cent in what ? Project Manager : So uh { disfmarker } yeah . Yeah . Then you have { disfmarker } Or you have to cut this off . Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } uh-uh . Project Manager : Then it 's not good anymore . Industrial Designer : No .

Um { disfmarker } Yeah , it 's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it 's still uh an advanced chip ? Industrial Designer : No . Uh , no , no , no . Project Manager : Or it 's then a regular ? Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } Oh , wait wait wait . Marketing : The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ was n't it ? User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Oh yeah . Project Manager : So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick . Industrial Designer : Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? Industrial Designer : If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ . Project Manager : Yeah , regular chip . But { disfmarker } Is it a good design ? Industrial Designer : Uh , yeah . Then you 'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you do n't have the L_C_D_ . Marketing : If uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : So , the T_V_s has to uh { disfmarker } have to be up-to-date . Marketing : If we have the n no buttons { disfmarker } If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have { disfmarker } uh , we have thirteen Euros ? Project Manager : Mm , yes . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Then it 's okay . Industrial Designer : Huh . No knew that . Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we { disfmarker } then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .

User Interface : Mm { disfmarker } Marketing : Well , it 's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it 's not uh really aimed for all customers . It does n't look like that . Project Manager : So it 's a { disfmarker } Marketing : That 's uh a six . Industrial Designer : Five . User Interface : Mm , four . Project Manager : Yes , it 's for the younger g group . So it 's uh half half of the people . User Interface : Yeah , but it 's it 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : So I think it 's four . User Interface : Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . Project Manager : No . User Interface : So { disfmarker } I mean , the colours are for young people , Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . User Interface : but Project Manager : Yes . So , I think it 's four . User Interface : older { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Maybe version uh three point O_ uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } has other colours . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Maybe . Project Manager : Okay . Give it a four . Industrial Designer : Four . Project Manager : Yep . Marketing : Four . Uh , okay . Mm . Project Manager : We put the fashion in electronics . Marketing : That 's uh the motto of our company . Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ? I um { disfmarker } Yeah . I think if we do this , as it 's uh uh c uh it 's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two . Industrial Designer : Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yes . Two . Project Manager : Uh , I say uh a five . Marketing : Two . Project Manager : It 's not fashion , it 's new . It must be a fashion . But it is n't . Industrial Designer : It { disfmarker } it will be fashion . Project Manager : Yes . It w If it 's not a fashion we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it 's a five . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Okay . User Interface : Then make it th three . Marketing : Okay . Yes , I 'll think of that too . Project Manager : No . Oh . Industrial Designer : 'Kay . Three is okay . Marketing : Yeah , agree ? Project Manager : I use my feet though . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Oh , we 'll wait outside . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } A three . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that 's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five . Industrial Designer : I give it a one . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { gap } . Yes , a one . I like it . Project Manager : Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half . { vocalsound } Marketing : We have to do our uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Say two . Marketing : Two or three ? Project Manager : Okay , two . Industrial Designer : Two . Marketing : Two . Okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : So , well we gon na do the next part . Uh , yep . Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average . So , um that 's why it 's a negative in it . Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to { vocalsound } uh this fashion , I { disfmarker } We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers . But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you do n't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two . Industrial Designer : One . Project Manager : { vocalsound } You ? User Interface : One . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Me too . One . Marketing : One . { vocalsound } Um , but { vocalsound } where where is the { gap } ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Next , six . It does not get lost easily . Marketing : So { disfmarker } Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : Yes . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Just a small thing . { vocalsound } Project Manager : No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it 's such a thing ? User Interface : Yeah , but uh { disfmarker } Yeah . Industrial Designer : Ah . Yellow . Project Manager : I do n't think so . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Looks like a pistol . Project Manager : Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } It wo n't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch . Project Manager : No . It wo n't get lost . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : It wo n't . Project Manager : A one ? { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah , o one . Project Manager : Okay , a one . Marketing : One . Project Manager : Next . Marketing : Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . Project Manager : { gap } Marketing : Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two . Project Manager : Yeah me { disfmarker } { gap } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Me too . Project Manager : That was our target . Two . Industrial Designer : Two . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Right . There 's a fancy look-and-feel . Marketing : Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I did n't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ? I would say yes . So um { disfmarker } Well , let 's also give this a two . T Industrial Designer : I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It 's { disfmarker } Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy { gap } trendy . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Yes , a one . Project Manager : I say a two . It 's a a bit personal . If it 's fancy . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : So I think s two is better . User Interface : Yeah , okay . Industrial Designer : Two is okay . Marketing : Okay . Two . Industrial Designer : { gap } . Marketing : And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends . Project Manager : No , it 's new . Innovation . Marketing : If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we did n't uh { disfmarker } We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . Industrial Designer : Oh . Marketing : So , I would { disfmarker } did not give this uh a one or two . I { disfmarker } We 'll go for a three . Project Manager : { gap } . Industrial Designer : I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yes . Industrial Designer : But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It 's also a trend , so I 'll give it a two . 
Query : What did the team discuss about the product cost ? Marketing : Next . Finance . Project Manager : So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ? Um , so if uh { disfmarker } I 'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Cheapest there is . Project Manager : Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip . Industrial Designer : Expensive . Project Manager : Yeah it 's the most advanced . Chip-on-print . We have that one . Industrial Designer : Well , it 's the most advanced . Project Manager : We have the simple , regular and advanced . Industrial Designer : Advanced . Project Manager : We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved . { gap } { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Then we have plastic , wood , rubber . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { gap } we have half rubber , half plastic . User Interface : Mm , yes . Project Manager : No titanium . Special colour . Yes , yellow . Industrial Designer : Uh , yellow . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Mm , yeah . Project Manager : Interface , push-button . Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ? Industrial Designer : One . Marketing : One . Project Manager : And it 's not really a s Industrial Designer : Joystick uh thing . Marketing : { gap } . Project Manager : Yeah , it 's this one . Now , uh button supplement . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Special colour . We already { disfmarker } Uh , that 's the { disfmarker } from the { disfmarker } for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour . User Interface : Mm , yeah . Project Manager : So , then uh { disfmarker } then then then then then then { disfmarker } Then { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } We 're not gon na make it . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh , no . It 's too expensive . Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } Wh Project Manager : So , we have to change something . Industrial Designer : What what are the costs ? Project Manager : Fifteen Euros . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Fifteen . Project Manager : Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it 's okay . 'Cause we ca n't lose the battery . We ca n't lose the advanced chip . We ca n't lose the double curve . We have rubber , special colour . Marketing : { gap } . We would have uh n Industrial Designer : A special colour . Project Manager : Oh , no , we { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh , I do n't think it 's a very special colour . Project Manager : No , it 's uh { disfmarker } Sorry ? Industrial Designer : Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ? Marketing : For a remote control . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } What ? Marketing : I 've { disfmarker } For a remote control , I think it is . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick . For up down left right . Project Manager : Um , then we uh lose two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much . Exactly the special colours . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : And what if we use only one sort of um { disfmarker } Um { vocalsound } just only plastic or only rubber ? Project Manager : That 's one Euro . Industrial Designer : One Euro discount . { vocalsound } Project Manager : So , I do n't think that 's good . Mm { disfmarker } I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . If { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left . Project Manager : Yes . Then it 's only thirteen Euros . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } And then we 'll lose fifty cent in what ? Project Manager : So uh { disfmarker } yeah . Yeah . Then you have { disfmarker } Or you have to cut this off . Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } uh-uh . Project Manager : Then it 's not good anymore . Industrial Designer : No . Project Manager : So , wait . Okay . I 'll have a look . { vocalsound } We { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : And if you say it 's just a r uh normal colour { disfmarker } it 's a normal colour , wh { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yellow rubber . Industrial Designer : No one will see it . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah , normal . Industrial Designer : Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left . Project Manager : Uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : And it 's twelve Euros , I think . Project Manager : One minute , please . Uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Is it maximum . Um { disfmarker } Yeah , it 's normal colour . But if you lose the joystick , it 's still uh an advanced chip ? Industrial Designer : No . Uh , no , no , no . Project Manager : Or it 's then a regular ? Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } Oh , wait wait wait . Marketing : The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ was n't it ? User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Oh yeah . Project Manager : So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick . Industrial Designer : Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? Industrial Designer : If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ . Project Manager : Yeah , regular chip . But { disfmarker } Is it a good design ? Industrial Designer : Uh , yeah . Then you 'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you do n't have the L_C_D_ . Marketing : If uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : So , the T_V_s has to uh { disfmarker } have to be up-to-date . Marketing : If we have the n no buttons { disfmarker } If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have { disfmarker } uh , we have thirteen Euros ? Project Manager : Mm , yes . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Then it 's okay . Industrial Designer : Huh . No knew that . Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we { disfmarker } then we get push-buttons from half a Euro . Industrial Designer : Yeah , then it 's twelve Euro fifty , then it 's okay . Project Manager : Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it 's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit . And you can not use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour , User Interface : Okay . All the same uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : you have to pay point two Euros . Industrial Designer : So , all the buttons has to { disfmarker } have to be the same colour . Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ? User Interface : Mm , yeah . Recognisable . Like what { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Recognisable , yeah . Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : Yeah . Mm , yeah . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah ? User Interface : Okay . Industrial Designer : Okay . Project Manager : { gap } So { disfmarker } Well { disfmarker } Now we have to change that , but that 's okay . Rubber . What 's the normal colour ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Oh , well that 's clear . Project Manager : { vocalsound } So { disfmarker } And { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Where 's { gap } ? Yeah . So , now it 's { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : And the joystick away . And its buttons . Project Manager : Yeah . It is . But then it will be just that ones . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Now it 's { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { gap } still , he waited at the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : Very good . Marketing : No . 
Query : What did the team say about the project and overall process ? Project Manager : Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well { disfmarker } What do you think of it ? Uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : About the Project Manager : About the project . Marketing : Project . Industrial Designer : process . Went good . Uh { disfmarker } I think uh the creativity uh { vocalsound } was good enough . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um { disfmarker } Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } yeah that was clear . Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it . And uh { disfmarker } no , uh o only the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } the drawing uh was very difficult . But , nah . New ideas found . { vocalsound } Nope . Project Manager : Okay . And you . User Interface : Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh { disfmarker } Yeah , it uh { disfmarker } It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um { disfmarker } Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor { gap } and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse . Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others . And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking . To tell their opinion . Project Manager : Okay . Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } No . Project Manager : So , it 's good for the speed . User Interface : No . Industrial Designer : Yep . Project Manager : So , I think we 're ready . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Good price . Evaluation ready . Ready . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Beer . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 's it . Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Okay then . Marketing : Okay . User Interface : { gap } . 
Query : Summarize the meeting Professor D : OK . PhD A : Mike . Mike - one ? PhD B : Ah . Professor D : We 're on ? Yes , please . I mean , we 're testing noise robustness but let 's not get silly . OK , so , uh , you 've got some , uh , Xerox things to pass out ? PhD A : Yeah , Professor D : That are { disfmarker } PhD A : um . Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sorry for the table , but as it grows in size , uh , it . Professor D : Uh , so for th the last column we use our imagination . OK . PhD B : Ah , yeah . Professor D : Ah . PhD A : Uh , yeah . PhD B : Uh , do you want @ @ . Professor D : This one 's nice , though . This has nice big font . PhD A : Yeah . Grad C : Let 's see . Yeah . Chop ! Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : So Professor D : When you get older you have these different perspectives . I mean , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font ! PhD A : Next time we will put colors or something . Professor D : That 's what 's { disfmarker } PhD A : Uh . Professor D : Yeah . It 's mostly big font . OK . PhD A : OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done { disfmarker } Professor D : Uh { disfmarker } Go ahead . PhD A : It 's this . Summary of experiments since , well , since last week Professor D : Oh . OK . PhD A : and also since the { disfmarker } we 've started to run { disfmarker } work on this . Um . { pause } So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um { vocalsound } uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely { disfmarker } Professor D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD A : well , it 's still not completely filled , Professor D :  PhD A : but { pause } we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and { pause } finally , hhh , { comment } um { pause } ehhh { comment } PL - uh delta seems very important . Uh { pause } I do n't know . If you take um , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next { disfmarker } t the second , uh , part of the table , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : uh { pause } when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta . Professor D : a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , uh , the baseline performance , PhD A : Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So { disfmarker } Professor D : but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ? PhD A : Yeah . Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much { pause } uh uh much smaller Professor D : Yes . PhD A : um { disfmarker } Grad C : It 's out of the way . PhD A : But , actually , um , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . And Mmm , { pause } Yeah . And f also for Italian , actually . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : um { pause } when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : and training with other languages is a little bit worse . Professor D : Um { disfmarker } Oh , I see . Down near the bottom of this sheet . PhD A : So , Professor D : Uh , { comment } { pause } yes . PhD A : yeah . Professor D : OK . PhD A : And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's { disfmarker } we have one hundred and seventy - two , Professor D : Yes . PhD A : and one hundred and four when we use delta . Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : Uh . { pause } Even if the contexts used is quite the same , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : because without delta we use seventeenths { disfmarker } seventeen frames . Uh . Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . Uh , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on , uh TI - digits . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : And , fff { comment } um , yeah . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from { comment } uh English digits , and from Italian digits . So this is the { disfmarker } another line { disfmarker } another set of lines in the table . Uh , @ @ with SPINE Professor D : Ah , yes . Mm - hmm . PhD A : and { pause } uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , uh , so we have to to redo the uh { disfmarker } the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . But Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : um this { disfmarker } this net performed quite well . Well , it 's { disfmarker } it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh . So , uh , yeah . We have also started feature combination experiments . Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together . And this is { disfmarker } The results are on the other document . Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps { disfmarker } well , just , @ @ . Yeah , so basically there are four { disfmarker } four kind of systems . The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using { disfmarker } and each feature stream has its own MPL . So it 's the { disfmarker } kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first . The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal . The second is using features and KLT transformed MLP outputs . And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs . Um , yeah . Mmm . You know you can { disfmarker } you can comment these results , PhD B : Yes , I can s I would like to say that , for example , um , mmm , if we does n't use the delta - delta , uh we have an improve when we use s some combination . But when PhD A : Yeah , we ju just to be clear , the numbers here are uh recognition accuracy . PhD B : w Yeah , this { disfmarker } Yeah , this number recognition acc PhD A : So it 's not the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Again we switch to another { disfmarker } PhD B : Yes , and the baseline { disfmarker } the baseline have { disfmarker } i is eighty - two . Professor D : Baseline is eighty - two . PhD B : Yeah PhD A : So it 's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this . Professor D : Uh , this is Italian mismatched . PhD A : Um . PhD B : Yeah , by the moment . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : OK . PhD B : And first in the experiment - one I { disfmarker } I do { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I use different MLP , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better . Um . for the ne { disfmarker } rest of experiment I use multi - English , only multi - English . And I try to combine different type of feature , but the result is that the MSG - three feature does n't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy . PhD A : Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table , the huge table , um , we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : but this is not the case for Italian what { disfmarker } where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : So , um { vocalsound } uh , well , I do n't think this is a bug but this { disfmarker } this is something in { disfmarker } probably in the MSG um process that uh I do n't know what exactly . Perhaps the fact that the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } there 's no low - pass filter , well , or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian , or , well , something simple like that . But { disfmarker } that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : because for the moment MSG do does n't bring much information . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : And as Carmen said , if we combine the two , we have the result , basically , of PLP . Professor D : I Um , the uh , baseline system { disfmarker } when you said the baseline system was uh , uh eighty - two percent , that was trained on what and tested on what ? That was , uh Italian mismatched d uh , uh , digits , uh , is the testing , PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : and the training is Italian digits ? PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : So the `` mismatch `` just refers to the noise and { disfmarker } and , uh microphone and so forth , PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : right ? So , um did we have { disfmarker } So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is { disfmarker } is the uh Italian digits ? PhD B : The train the training of the HTK ? Professor D : The { disfmarker } PhD B : Yes . Ah yes ! Professor D : Yes . PhD B : This h Yes . Th - Yes . Professor D : Yes . Training of the net , PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : yeah . So , um { disfmarker } So what that says is that in a matched condition , { vocalsound } we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP . Now w would { disfmarker } do we have a number , I suppose for the matched { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I do n't mean matched , but uh use of Italian { disfmarker } training in Italian digits for PLP only ? PhD B : Uh { pause } yes ? PhD A : Uh { pause } yeah , so this is { disfmarker } basically this is in the table . Uh { pause } so the number is fifty - two , PhD B : Another table . PhD A : uh { disfmarker } Professor D : Fifty - two percent . PhD A : Fift - So { disfmarker } No , it 's { disfmarker } it 's the { disfmarker } PhD B : No . Professor D : No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ? PhD A : Of { disfmarker } of { disfmarker } of uh { pause } eighteen { disfmarker } PhD B : Eighty . PhD A : of eighteen . PhD B : Eighty . PhD A : So it 's { disfmarker } it 's error rate , basically . PhD B : It 's plus six . PhD A : It 's er error rate ratio . So { disfmarker } Professor D : Oh this is accuracy ! PhD A : Uh , so we have nine { disfmarker } nine { disfmarker } let 's say ninety percent . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : Oy ! { comment } OK . Ninety . PhD A : Yeah . Um { comment } which is uh { comment } what we have also if use PLP and MSG together , Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : eighty - nine point seven . Professor D : OK , so even just PLP , uh , it is not , in the matched condition { disfmarker } Um I wonder if it 's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra , or whether it 's that the net half , for some reason , is not helping . PhD A : Uh . P - PLP and Mel cepstra give the same { disfmarker } same results . Professor D : Same result pretty much ? PhD A : Well , we have these results . I do n't know . It 's not { disfmarker } Do you have this result with PLP alone , { comment } j fee feeding HTK ? Professor D : So , s PhD A : That { disfmarker } That 's what you mean ? PhD B : Yeah , PhD A : Just PLP at the input of HTK . PhD B : yeah yeah yeah yeah , at the first { disfmarker } and the { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD A : Yeah . So , PLP { disfmarker } Professor D : Eighty - eight point six . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Um , so adding MSG PhD A : Um { disfmarker } Professor D : um { disfmarker } Well , but that 's { disfmarker } yeah , that 's without the neural net , PhD A : Yeah , that 's without the neural net Professor D : right ? PhD A : and that 's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization . Professor D : But she had said eighty - two . PhD A : This is the { disfmarker } w well , but this is without on - line normalization . Professor D : Right ? Oh , this { disfmarker } the eighty - two . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B :  PhD A : Eighty - two is the { disfmarker } it 's the Aurora baseline , so MFCC . Then we can use { disfmarker } well , OGI , they use MFCC { disfmarker } th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization Professor D : Oh , I 'm sorry , I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy . PhD A : Yeah , sorry . Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : OK . Alright . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Alright . So this is { disfmarker } I was thinking all this was worse . OK so this is all better PhD B : Yes , better . Professor D : because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : OK . I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm all better now . OK , go ahead . PhD A : So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent . Professor D : Yeah . Mm - hmm . PhD A : Uh , when we apply a neural network , is the same . We j jump to ninety percent . PhD B : Nnn , we do n't know exactly . Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : And { disfmarker } And um { disfmarker } whatever the normalization , actually . If we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent . So { disfmarker } Professor D : So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to { disfmarker } to ninety , or something . PhD A : Well , ninety { disfmarker } No , I { disfmarker } I mean ninety It 's around eighty - nine , ninety , eighty - eight . Professor D : Eighty - nine . PhD A : Well , there are minor { disfmarker } minor differences . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : And then adding the MSG does nothing , basically . PhD A : No . Professor D : Yeah . OK . PhD A : Uh For Italian , yeah . Professor D : For this case , right ? PhD A : Um . Professor D : Alright . So , um { disfmarker } So actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG , if you { disfmarker } uh does not help in that case . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Um { disfmarker } PhD A : But w Yeah . Professor D : The other ones , we 'd have to look at it , but { disfmarker } And the multi - English , does uh { disfmarker } So if we think of this in error rates , we start off with , uh eighteen percent error rate , roughly . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Um { pause } and { pause } we uh almost , uh cut that in half by um putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net . PhD A : Yeah Professor D : And the MSG does n't however particularly affect things . PhD A : No . Professor D : And we cut off , I guess about twenty - five percent of the error . Uh { pause } no , not quite that , is it . Uh , two point six out of eighteen . About , um { pause } sixteen percent or something of the error , um , if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Yeah . Professor D : Not matching condition , but uh , the uh , Italian training . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : OK . PhD A : Mmm . PhD B : We select these { disfmarker } these { disfmarker } these tasks because it 's the more difficult . Professor D : Yes , good . OK ? So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you 're not gon na have matching , uh , data for the { disfmarker } uh for the new { disfmarker } for the other languages and so forth . Um , one qu thing is that , uh { disfmarker } I think I asked you this before , but I wan na double check . When you say `` ME `` in these other tests , that 's the multi - English , PhD A : That 's { disfmarker } it 's a part { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } Professor D : but it is not all of the multi - English , right ? It is some piece of { disfmarker } part of it . PhD A : Or , one million frames . Professor D : And the multi - English is how much ? PhD B : You have here the information . PhD A : It 's one million and a half . Yeah . Professor D : Oh , so you used almost all You used two thirds of it , PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : you think . So , it it 's still { disfmarker } it hurts you { disfmarker } seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish . PhD A : Mmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : I wonder why Yeah . Uh . Grad C : Well Stephane was saying that they were n't hand - labeled , PhD A : Yeah , it 's { disfmarker } PhD B : Yeah . PhD A : Yeah . Grad C : the French and the Spanish . PhD B : The Spanish . Maybe for that . Professor D : Hmm . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : It 's still { disfmarker } OK . Alright , go ahead . And then { disfmarker } then { disfmarker } PhD B : Um . Mmm , with the experiment type - two , I { disfmarker } first I tried to to combine , nnn , some feature from the MLP and other feature { disfmarker } another feature . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : And we s we can { disfmarker } first the feature are without delta and delta - delta , and we can see that in the situation , uh , the MSG - three , the same help nothing . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : And then I do the same but with the delta and delta - delta { disfmarker } PLP delta and delta - delta . And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta . And we have a l little bit less result than the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Maybe if { disfmarker } when we have the new { disfmarker } the new { pause } neural network trained with PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe the final result must be better . I do n't know . PhD A : Actually , just to be some more { disfmarker } PhD B : Uh { disfmarker } PhD A : Do This number , this eighty - seven point one number , has to be compared with the Professor D : Yes , yeah , I mean it ca n't be compared with the other PhD A : Which number ? Professor D : cuz this is , uh { disfmarker } with multi - English , uh , training . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor D : So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box , which is that , uh the eighty - four point six . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Right ? PhD A : Uh . Professor D : So { disfmarker } PhD A : Yeah , but I mean in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : and straight features with delta - delta . And straight features with delta - delta gives you what 's on the first sheet . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Yeah . Not t not PhD A : It 's eight eighty - eight point six . Professor D : tr No . No . No . PhD B : Yes . Professor D : Not trained with multi - English . PhD A : Uh , yeah , but th this is the second configuration . PhD B : No , but they { disfmarker } they feature @ @ without { disfmarker } PhD A : So we use feature out uh , net outputs together with features . So yeah , this is not { disfmarker } perhaps not clear here but in this table , the first column is for MLP and the second for the features . Professor D : Eh . { comment } Oh , I see . Ah . So you 're saying w so asking the question , `` What { disfmarker } what has adding the MLP done to improve over the , PhD A : So , just { disfmarker } Yeah so , actually it { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } it decreased the { disfmarker } the accuracy . Professor D : uh { disfmarker } PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : Yes . PhD A : Because we have eighty - eight point six . Professor D : Uh - huh . PhD A : And even the MLP alone { disfmarker } What gives the MLP alone ? Multi - English PLP . Oh no , it gives eighty - three point six . So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six , PhD B : But { disfmarker } PhD A : that gives eighty - seven point one . Professor D : Mm - hmm . Eighty - s I thought it was eighty Oh , OK , eighty - three point six and eighty { disfmarker } eighty - eight point six . PhD A : Eighty - three point six . Eighty { disfmarker } Professor D : OK . PhD A : Is th is that right ? Yeah ? PhD B : Yeah . But { disfmarker } I do n't know { disfmarker } but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP { pause } delta and delta - delta , maybe tha this can help . PhD A : Perhaps , yeah . Professor D : Well , that 's { disfmarker } that 's one thing , but see the other thing is that , um , I mean it 's good to take the difficult case , but let 's { disfmarker } let 's consider what that means . What { disfmarker } what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that { disfmarker } I mean my interpretation of your { disfmarker } your s original suggestion is something like this , as motivation . When we train on data that is in one sense or another , similar to the testing data , then we get a win by having discriminant training . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : When we train on something that 's quite different , we have a potential to have some problems . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : And , um , if we get something that helps us when it 's somewhat similar , and does n't hurt us too much when it { disfmarker } when it 's quite different , that 's maybe not so bad . PhD A : Yeah . Mmm . Professor D : So the question is , if you took the same combination , and you tried it out on , uh { disfmarker } on say digits , PhD A : On TI - digits ? OK . Professor D : you know , d Was that experiment done ? PhD A : No , not yet . Professor D : Yeah , OK . Uh , then does that , eh { disfmarker } you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth , { comment } does it { disfmarker } does it then look much better ? PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh { disfmarker } of tests ? So , an anyway . OK , go ahead . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : And , with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven , uh , d I have found more or less the same result . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : So , it 's slightly better , PhD B : Little bit better ? PhD A : yeah . Professor D : Slightly better . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : Slightly bet better . Yes , is better . Professor D : And { disfmarker } and you know again maybe if you use the , uh , delta { pause } there , uh , you would bring it up to where it was , uh you know at least about the same for a difficult case . PhD B : Yeah , maybe . Maybe . Maybe . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : Oh , yeah . PhD A : Yeah . Well , so perhaps let 's { disfmarker } let 's jump at the last experiment . PhD B : Oh , yeah . Professor D : So . PhD A : It 's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output . PhD B : i Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : It 's again better . So it 's eighty - nine point { disfmarker } point one . PhD B : Yeah , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and we have only forty { disfmarker } forty feature PhD A : So . PhD B : because in this situation we have one hundred and three feature . Professor D : Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . And then w with the first configuration , I f I am found that work , uh , does n't work { disfmarker } Professor D : Yeah . PhD B : uh , well , work , but is better , the second configuration . Because I { disfmarker } for the del Engli - PLP delta and delta - delta , here I have eighty - five point three accuracy , and with the second configuration I have eighty - seven point one . Professor D : Um , by the way , there is a another , uh , suggestion that would apply , uh , to the second configuration , um , which , uh , was made , uh , by , uh , Hari . And that was that , um , if you have { disfmarker } uh feed two streams into HTK , um , and you , uh , change the , uh variances { disfmarker } if you scale the variances associated with , uh these streams um , you can effectively scale { pause } the streams . Right ? So , um , you know , without changing the scripts for HTK , which is the rule here , uh , you can still change the variances PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : which would effectively change the scale of these { disfmarker } these , uh , two streams that come in . PhD A : Uh , { comment } yeah . Professor D : And , um , so , um , if you do that , for instance it may be the case that , um , the MLP should not be considered as strongly , for instance . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : And , um , so this is just setting them to be , excuse me , of equal { disfmarker } equal weight . Maybe it should n't be equal weight . PhD B : Maybe . Professor D : Right ? You know , I I 'm sorry to say that gives more experiments if we wanted to look at that , but { disfmarker } but , uh , um , you know on the other hand it 's just experiments at the level of the HTK recognition . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : It 's not even the HTK , PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : uh , uh { disfmarker } PhD B : Yeah . Yeah . Professor D : Well , I guess you have to do the HTK training also . PhD B : so this is what we decided to do . Professor D : Uh , do you ? Let me think . Maybe you do n't . Uh . Yeah , you have to change the { disfmarker } No , you can just do it in { disfmarker } as { disfmarker } once you 've done the training { disfmarker } Grad C : And then you can vary it . Yeah . Professor D : Yeah , the training is just coming up with the variances so I guess you could { disfmarker } you could just scale them all . PhD A : Scale Professor D : Variances . PhD A : Yeah . But { disfmarker } Is it { disfmarker } i th I mean the HTK models are diagonal covariances , so I d Is it { disfmarker } Professor D : That 's uh , exactly the point , I think , that if you change { disfmarker } um , change what they are { disfmarker } PhD A : Hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor D : It 's diagonal covariance matrices , but you say what those variances are . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : So , that { disfmarker } you know , it 's diagonal , but the diagonal means th that then you 're gon na { disfmarker } it 's gon na { disfmarker } it 's gon na internally multiply it { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and uh , { vocalsound } uh , i it im uh implicitly exponentiated to get probabilities , and so it 's { disfmarker } it 's gon na { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } it 's going to affect the range of things if you change the { disfmarker } change the variances { pause } of some of the features . PhD A : Mmm . Mmm . PhD B : do ? Professor D : So , i it 's precisely given that model you can very simply affect , uh , the s the strength that you apply the features . That was { disfmarker } that was , uh , Hari 's suggestion . PhD A : Yeah . Yeah . Professor D : So , um { disfmarker } PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : Yeah . So . So it could just be that h treating them equally , tea treating two streams equally is just { disfmarker } just not the right thing to do . Of course it 's potentially opening a can of worms because , you know , maybe it should be a different { vocalsound } number for { disfmarker } for each { vocalsound } kind of { pause } test set , or something , PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : but { disfmarker } OK . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : So I guess the other thing is to take { disfmarker } you know { disfmarker } if one were to take , uh , you know , a couple of the most successful of these , PhD A : Yeah , and test across everything . Professor D : and uh { disfmarker } Yeah , try all these different tests . PhD A : Mmm . PhD B : Yeah . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Alright . Uh . PhD A : So , the next point , yeah , we 've had some discussion with Steve and Shawn , um , about their um , uh , articulatory stuff , um . So we 'll perhaps start something next week . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : Um , discussion with Hynek , Sunil and Pratibha for trying to plug in their our { disfmarker } our networks with their { disfmarker } within their block diagram , uh , where to plug in the { disfmarker } the network , uh , after the { disfmarker } the feature , before as um a as a plugin or as a anoth another path , discussion about multi - band and TRAPS , um , actually Hynek would like to see , perhaps if you remember the block diagram there is , uh , temporal LDA followed b by a spectral LDA for each uh critical band . And he would like to replace these by a network which would , uh , make the system look like a TRAP . Well , basically , it would be a TRAP system . Basically , this is a TRAP system { disfmarker } kind of TRAP system , I mean , but where the neural network are replaced by LDA . Hmm . { vocalsound } Um , yeah , and about multi - band , uh , I started multi - band MLP trainings , um mmh { comment } Actually , I w I w hhh { comment } prefer to do exactly what I did when I was in Belgium . So I take exactly the same configurations , seven bands with nine frames of context , and we just train on TIMIT , and on the large database , so , with SPINE and everything . And , mmm , I 'm starting to train also , networks with larger contexts . So , this would { disfmarker } would be something between TRAPS and multi - band because we still have quite large bands , and { disfmarker } but with a lot of context also . So Um Yeah , we still have to work on Finnish , um , basically , to make a decision on which MLP can be the best across the different languages . For the moment it 's the TIMIT network , and perhaps the network trained on everything . So . Now we can test these two networks on { disfmarker } with { disfmarker } with delta and large networks . Well , test them also on Finnish PhD B : Mmm . PhD A : and see which one is the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the best . Uh , well , the next part of the document is , well , basically , a kind of summary of what { disfmarker } everything that has been done . So . We have seventy - nine M L Ps trained on one , two , three , four , uh , three , four , five , six , seven ten { disfmarker } on ten different databases . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : Uh , the number of frames is bad also , so we have one million and a half for some , three million for other , and six million for the last one . Uh , yeah ! { comment } As we mentioned , TIMIT is the only that 's hand - labeled , and perhaps this is what makes the difference . Um . Yeah , the other are just Viterbi - aligned . So these seventy - nine MLP differ on different things . First , um with respect to the on - line normalization , there are { disfmarker } that use bad on - line normalization , and other good on - line normalization . Um . With respect to the features , with respect to the use of delta or no , uh with respect to the hidden layer size and to the targets . Uh , but of course we do n't have all the combination of these different parameters Um . s What 's this ? We only have two hundred eighty six different tests And no not two thousand . Professor D : Ugh ! I was impressed boy , two thousand . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : Ah , yes . Professor D : OK . PhD B : I say this morning that @ @ thought it was the { disfmarker } Professor D : Alright , now I 'm just slightly impressed , OK . PhD A : Um . Yeah , basically the observation is what we discussed already . The MSG problem , um , the fact that the MLP trained on target task decreased the error rate . but when the M - MLP is trained on the um { disfmarker } is not trained on the target task , it increased the error rate compared to using straight features . Except if the features are bad { disfmarker } uh , actually except if the features are not correctly on - line normalized . In this case the tandem is still better even if it 's trained on { disfmarker } not on the target digits . Professor D : Yeah . So it sounds like { vocalsound } yeah , the net corrects some of the problems with some poor normalization . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : But if you can do good normalization it 's { disfmarker } it 's uh { disfmarker } OK . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . PhD A : Uh , so the fourth point is , yeah , the TIMIT plus noise seems to be the training set that gives better { disfmarker } the best network . Professor D : So So - Let me { disfmarker } bef before you go on to the possible issues . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : So , on the MSG uh problem um , I think that in { disfmarker } in the { disfmarker } um , in the short { pause } time { pause } solution um , that is , um , trying to figure out what we can proceed forward with to make the greatest progress , PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : uh , much as I said with JRASTA , even though I really like JRASTA and I really like MSG , PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : I think it 's kind of in category that it 's , it { disfmarker } it may be complicated . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : And uh it might be { disfmarker } if someone 's interested in it , uh , certainly encourage anybody to look into it in the longer term , once we get out of this particular rush { pause } uh for results . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : But in the short term , unless you have some { disfmarker } some s strong idea of what 's wrong , PhD A : I do n't know at all but I 've { disfmarker } perhaps { disfmarker } I have the feeling that it 's something that 's quite { disfmarker } quite simple or just like nnn , no high - pass filter Professor D : Yeah , probably . PhD A : or { disfmarker } Mmm . Yeah . { pause } My { disfmarker } But I do n't know . Professor D : There 's supposed to { disfmarker } well MSG is supposed to have a an on - line normalization though , right ? PhD A : It 's { disfmarker } There is , yeah , an AGC - kind of AGC . Yeah . { vocalsound } Yeah . Yeah . Professor D : Yeah , but also there 's an on - line norm besides the AGC , there 's an on - line normalization that 's supposed to be uh , yeah , PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : taking out means and variances and so forth . So . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : In fac in fact the on - line normalization that we 're using came from the MSG design , PhD A : Um . Professor D : so it 's { disfmarker } PhD A : Yeah , but { disfmarker } Yeah . But this was the bad on - line normalization . Actually . Uh . Are your results are still with the bad { disfmarker } the bad { disfmarker } PhD B : Maybe , may { disfmarker } No ? With the better { disfmarker } PhD A : With the O - OLN - two ? PhD B : No ? PhD A : Ah yeah , you have { disfmarker } you have OLN - two , PhD B : Oh ! Yeah , yeah , yeah ! With `` two `` , with `` on - line - two `` . PhD A : yeah . PhD B : Yeah , yeah , Professor D : `` On - line - two `` is good . PhD A : So it 's , is the good yeah . PhD B : yeah . Yep , it 's a good . Professor D : `` Two `` is good ? PhD A : And { disfmarker } Professor D : No , `` two `` is bad . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : Well , actually , it 's good with the ch with the good . Professor D : OK . Yeah . So { disfmarker } Yeah , I { disfmarker } I agree . It 's probably something simple uh , i if { disfmarker } if uh someone , you know , uh , wants to play with it for a little bit . I mean , you 're gon na do what you 're gon na do PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : but { disfmarker } but my { disfmarker } my guess would be that it 's something that is a simple thing that could take a while to find . PhD A : But { disfmarker } Yeah . Mmm . I see , yeah . Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : And { disfmarker } Professor D : Uh . { comment } And the other { disfmarker } the results uh , observations two and three , Um , is PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : uh { disfmarker } Yeah , that 's pretty much what we 've seen . That 's { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } what we were concerned about is that if it 's not on the target task { disfmarker } If it 's on the target task then it { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } it helps to have the MLP transforming it . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : If it uh { disfmarker } if it 's not on the target task , then , depending on how different it is , uh you can get uh , a reduction in performance . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : And the question is now how to { disfmarker } how to get one and not the other ? Or how to { disfmarker } how to ameliorate the { disfmarker } the problems . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : Um , because it { disfmarker } it certainly does { disfmarker } is nice to have in there , when it { disfmarker } { vocalsound } when there is something like the training data . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Um . Yeah . So , { pause } the { disfmarker } the reason { disfmarker } Yeah , the reason is that the { disfmarker } perhaps the target { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the task dependency { disfmarker } the language dependency , { vocalsound } and the noise dependency { disfmarker } Professor D : So that 's what you say th there . I see . PhD A : Well , the e e But this is still not clear because , um , I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I do n't think we have enough result to talk about the { disfmarker } the language dependency . Well , the TIMIT network is still the best but there is also an the other difference , the fact that it 's { disfmarker } it 's hand - labeled . Professor D : Hey ! Um , just { disfmarker } you can just sit here . Uh , I d I do n't think we want to mess with the microphones but it 's uh { disfmarker } Just uh , have a seat . Um . s Summary of the first uh , uh forty - five minutes is that some stuff work and { disfmarker } works , and some stuff does n't OK , PhD A : We still have uh { pause } this { disfmarker } One of these perhaps ? PhD B : Yeah . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Yeah , I guess we can do a little better than that but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I think if you { disfmarker } if you start off with the other one , actually , that sort of has it in words and then th that has it the { pause } associated results . PhD B : Um . Professor D : OK . So you 're saying that um , um , although from what we see , yes there 's what you would expect in terms of a language dependency and a noise dependency . That is , uh , when the neural net is trained on one of those and tested on something different , we do n't do as well as in the target thing . But you 're saying that uh , it is { disfmarker } Although that general thing is observable so far , there 's something you 're not completely convinced about . And { disfmarker } and what is that ? I mean , you say `` not clear yet `` . What { disfmarker } what do you mean ? PhD A : Uh , mmm , uh , { comment } I mean , that the { disfmarker } the fact that s Well , for { disfmarker } for TI - digits the TIMIT net is the best , which is the English net . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : But the other are slightly worse . But you have two { disfmarker } two effects , the effect of changing language and the effect of training on something that 's { pause } Viterbi - aligned instead of hand { disfmarker } hand - labeled . PhD B : Yeah . PhD A : So . Um . Yeah . Professor D : Do you think the alignments are bad ? I mean , have you looked at the alignments at all ? What the Viterbi alignment 's doing ? PhD A : Mmm . I do n't { disfmarker } I do n't know . Did - did you look at the Spanish alignments Carmen ? PhD B : Mmm , no . Professor D : Might be interesting to look at it . Because , I mean , that is just looking but um , um { disfmarker } It 's not clear to me you necessarily would do so badly from a Viterbi alignment . It depends how good the recognizer is PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : that 's { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the engine is that 's doing the alignment . PhD A : Yeah . But { disfmarker } Yeah . But , perhaps it 's not really the { disfmarker } the alignment that 's bad but the { disfmarker } just the ph phoneme string that 's used for the alignment Professor D : Aha ! PhD A : Mmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : The pronunciation models and so forth PhD A : I mean { pause } for { disfmarker } We { disfmarker } It 's single pronunciation , uh { disfmarker } Professor D : Aha . PhD A : French { disfmarker } French s uh , phoneme strings were corrected manually Professor D : I see . PhD A : so we asked people to listen to the um { disfmarker } the sentence and we gave the phoneme string and they kind of correct them . But still , there { disfmarker } there might be errors just in the { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } in the ph string of phonemes . Mmm . Um . Yeah , so this is not really the Viterbi alignment , in fact , yeah . Um , the third { disfmarker } The third uh issue is the noise dependency perhaps but , well , this is not clear yet because all our nets are trained on the same noises and { disfmarker } Professor D : I thought some of the nets were trained with SPINE and so forth . So it { disfmarker } And that has other noise . PhD A : Yeah . So { disfmarker } Yeah . But { disfmarker } Yeah . Results are only coming for { disfmarker } for this net . Mmm . Professor D : OK , yeah , just do n't { disfmarker } just need more { disfmarker } more results there with that @ @ . PhD A : Yeah . Um . So . Uh , from these results we have some questions with answers . What should be the network input ? Um , PLP work as well as MFCC , I mean . Um . But it seems impor important to use the delta . Uh , with respect to the network size , there 's one experiment that 's still running and we should have the result today , comparing network with five hundred and { pause } one thousand units . So , nnn , still no answer actually . Professor D : Hm - hmm . PhD A : Uh , the training set , well , some kind of answer . We can , we can tell which training set gives the best result , but { vocalsound } we do n't know exactly why . Uh , so . Professor D : Uh . Right , I mean the multi - English so far is { disfmarker } is the best . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : `` Multi - multi - English `` just means `` TIMIT `` , PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : right ? PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : So uh That 's { disfmarker } Yeah . So . And { disfmarker } and when you add other things in to { disfmarker } to broaden it , it gets worse { pause } uh typically . PhD A : Mmm . Mm - hmm . Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : Then uh some questions without answers . Professor D : OK . PhD A : Uh , training set , um , Professor D : Uh - huh . PhD A : uh , training targets { disfmarker } Professor D : I like that . The training set is both questions , with answers and without answers . PhD A : It 's { disfmarker } Yeah . Yeah . Professor D : It 's sort of , yes { disfmarker } it 's mul it 's multi - uh - purpose . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : OK . PhD A : Uh , training s Right . So { disfmarker } Yeah , the training targets actually , the two of the main issues perhaps are still the language dependency { vocalsound } and the noise dependency . And perhaps to try to reduce the language dependency , we should focus on finding some other kind of training targets . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : And labeling s labeling seems important uh , because of TIMIT results . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : Uh . For moment you use { disfmarker } we use phonetic targets but we could also use articulatory targets , soft targets , and perhaps even , um use networks that does n't do classification but just regression so uh , train to have neural networks that um , um , uh , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : does a regression and well , basically com com compute features and noit not , nnn , features without noise . I mean uh , transform the fea noisy features { vocalsound } in other features that are not noisy . But continuous features . Not uh uh , hard targets . Professor D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD A : Uh { disfmarker } Professor D : Yeah , that { pause } seems like a good thing to do , probably , not uh again a short - term sort of thing . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : I mean one of the things about that is that um it 's { disfmarker } e u the ri I guess the major risk you have there of being { disfmarker } is being dependent on { disfmarker } very dependent on the kind of noise and { disfmarker } and so forth . PhD A : Yeah . f But , yeah . Professor D : Uh . But it 's another thing to try . PhD A : So , this is w w i wa wa this is one thing , this { disfmarker } this could be { disfmarker } could help { disfmarker } could help perhaps to reduce language dependency and for the noise part um we could combine this with other approaches , like , well , the Kleinschmidt approach . So the d the idea of putting all the noise that we can find inside a database . I think Kleinschmidt was using more than fifty different noises to train his network , PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : and { disfmarker } So this is one { vocalsound } approach and the other is multi - band { vocalsound } { vocalsound } uh , that I think is more robust to the noisy changes . Professor D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD A : So perhaps , I think something like multi - band trained on a lot of noises with uh , features - based targets could { disfmarker } could { disfmarker } could help . Professor D : Yeah , if you { disfmarker } i i It 's interesting thought maybe if you just trained up { disfmarker } I mean w yeah , one { disfmarker } one fantasy would be you have something like articulatory targets and you have { pause } um some reasonable database , um but then { disfmarker } which is um { vocalsound } copied over many times with a range of different noises , PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : And uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } If { disfmarker } Cuz what you 're trying to { pause } do is come up with a { disfmarker } a core , reasonable feature set which is then gon na be used uh , by the { disfmarker } the uh HMM { pause } system . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : So . Yeah , OK . PhD A : So , um , yeah . The future work is , { pause } well , try to connect to the { disfmarker } to make { disfmarker } to plug in the system to the OGI system . Um , there are still open questions there , where to put the MLP basically . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : Um . Professor D : And I guess , you know , the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the real open question , I mean , e u there 's lots of open questions , but one of the core quote { comment } `` open questions `` for that is um , um , if we take the uh { disfmarker } you know , the best ones here , maybe not just the best one , but the best few or something { disfmarker } You want the most promising group from these other experiments . Um , how well do they do over a range of these different tests , not just the Italian ? PhD A : Mmm , Professor D : Um . And y PhD A : Yeah , yeah . Professor D : y { pause } Right ? And then um { disfmarker } then see , { pause } again , how { disfmarker } We know that there 's a mis there 's a uh { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than { disfmarker } than , uh we 're gon na test on , but well , if you look over a range of these different tests um , how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the MLP features , uh stand up over that range ? PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor D : That 's { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } that seems like the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the real question . And if you know that { disfmarker } So if you just take PLP with uh , the double - deltas . Assume that 's the p the feature . look at these different ways of combining it . And uh , take { disfmarker } let 's say , just take uh multi - English cause that works pretty well for the training . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : And just look { disfmarker } take that case and then look over all the different things . How does that { disfmarker } How does that compare between the { disfmarker } PhD A : So all the { disfmarker } all the test sets you mean , yeah . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : All the different test sets , PhD A : And { disfmarker } Professor D : and for { disfmarker } and for the couple different ways that you have of { disfmarker } of { disfmarker } of combining them . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Um . { pause } How well do they stand up , over the { disfmarker } PhD A : Mmm . And perhaps doing this for { disfmarker } cha changing the variance of the streams and so on { pause } getting different scaling { disfmarker } PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor D : That 's another possibility if you have time , yeah . Yeah . PhD A : Um . Yeah , so thi this sh would be more working on the MLP as an additional path instead of an insert to the { disfmarker } to their diagram . Professor D :  PhD A : Cuz { disfmarker } Yeah . Perhaps the insert idea is kind of strange because nnn , they { disfmarker } they make LDA and then we will again add a network does discriminate anal nnn , that discriminates , Professor D : Yeah . { pause } It 's a little strange PhD A : or { disfmarker } ? Mmm ? Professor D : but on the other hand they did it before . PhD A : Mmm . And { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and Professor D : Um the PhD A : yeah . And because also perhaps we know that the { disfmarker } when we have very good features the MLP does n't help . So . I do n't know . Professor D : Um , the other thing , though , is that um { disfmarker } So . Uh , we { disfmarker } we wan na get their path running here , right ? If so , we can add this other stuff . PhD A : Um . Professor D : as an additional path right ? PhD A : Yeah , the { disfmarker } the way we want to do { disfmarker } Professor D : Cuz they 're doing LDA { pause } RASTA . PhD A : The d What ? Professor D : They 're doing LDA RASTA , PhD A : Yeah , the way we want to do it perhaps is to { disfmarker } just to get the VAD labels and the final features . Professor D : yeah ? PhD A : So they will send us the { disfmarker } Well , provide us with the feature files , Professor D : I see . I see . PhD A : and with VAD uh , binary labels so that we can uh , get our MLP features and filter them with the VAD and then combine them with their f feature stream . So . Professor D : I see . So we { disfmarker } So . First thing of course we 'd wan na do there is to make sure that when we get those labels of final features is that we get the same results as them . Without putting in a second path . PhD A : Uh . You mean { disfmarker } Oh , yeah ! Just re re retraining r retraining the HTK ? Professor D : Yeah just th w i i Just to make sure that we { pause } have { disfmarker } we understand properly what things are , our very first thing to do is to { disfmarker } is to double check that we get the exact same results as them on HTK . PhD A : Oh yeah . Yeah , OK . Mmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : Uh , I mean , I do n't know that we need to r PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Um { pause } Do we need to retrain I mean we can just take the re their training files also . But . { pause } But , uh just for the testing , jus just make sure that we get the same results { pause } so we can duplicate it before we add in another { disfmarker } PhD A : Mmm . OK . Professor D : Cuz otherwise , you know , we wo n't know what things mean . PhD A : Oh , yeah . OK . And um . Yeah , so fff , LogRASTA , I do n't know if we want to { disfmarker } We can try { pause } networks with LogRASTA filtered features . Professor D : Maybe . PhD A : Mmm . I 'm sorry ? Yeah . Well { disfmarker } Yeah . But { disfmarker } Professor D : Oh ! You know , the other thing is when you say comb I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm sorry , I 'm interrupting . { comment } that u Um , uh , when you 're talking about combining multiple features , um { disfmarker } Suppose we said , `` OK , we 've got these different features and so forth , but PLP seems { pause } pretty good . `` If we take the approach that Mike did and have { disfmarker } PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : I mean , one of the situations we have is we have these different conditions . We have different languages , we have different { disfmarker } { vocalsound } different noises , Um { pause } If we have some drastically different conditions and we just train up different M L Ps { pause } with them . PhD A :  Professor D : And put { disfmarker } put them together . What { disfmarker } what { disfmarker } What Mike found , for the reverberation case at least , I mean { disfmarker } I mean , who knows if it 'll work for these other ones . That you did have nice interpolative effects . That is , that yes , if you knew { pause } what the reverberation condition was gon na be and you trained for that , then you got the best results . But if you had , say , a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case , uh , and then you fed the thing , uh something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two . So it was sort of { disfmarker } behaved reasonably . Is tha that a fair { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD A : Yeah . So you { disfmarker } you think it 's perhaps better to have several M L Yeah but { disfmarker } Professor D : It works better if { pause } what ? PhD A : Yea Professor D : I see . Well , see , i oc You were doing some something that was { disfmarker } So maybe the analogy is n't quite right . You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved . You had reverb for a single variable which was re uh , uh , reverberation . Here the problem seems to be is that we do n't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data . But we have s f { pause } for this kind of task , I would think , { pause } sort of a modest amount . I mean , a million frames actually is n't that much . We have a modest amount of { disfmarker } of uh training data from a couple different conditions , and then uh { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } yeah , that { disfmarker } and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language , and noise type uh , and uh , { pause } uh , channel characteristic , sort of all over the map . A bunch of different dimensions . And so , I 'm just concerned that we do n't really have { pause } um , the data to train up { disfmarker } I mean one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in { disfmarker } we still do n't have a good explanation for this , but we are seeing that we 're adding in uh , a fe few different databases and uh the performance is getting worse and uh , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } is better . And uh that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that . But one way or another { pause } we do n't have uh , seemingly , the ability { pause } to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , um , all of the variability { pause } that we 're gon na be covering . So that I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm hoping that um , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making , which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , uh , that uh if we { disfmarker } if they look at more constrained conditions they { disfmarker } they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . PhD A : So doing both is { disfmarker } is not { disfmarker } is not right , you mean , or { disfmarker } ? Yeah . Professor D : Yeah . I { disfmarker } I just sort of have a feeling { disfmarker } PhD A : But { disfmarker } Yeah . Mm - hmm . Professor D : Yeah . I mean { disfmarker } { vocalsound } i i e The um { disfmarker } I think it 's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA { pause } RASTA , which is a kind of LogRASTA , it 's just that they have the { disfmarker } I mean it 's done in the log domain , as I recall , and it 's { disfmarker } it uh { disfmarker } it 's just that they d it 's trained up , right ? That that um benefitted from on - line normalization . So they did { disfmarker } At least in their case , it did seem to be somewhat complimentary . So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ? I mean they { disfmarker } they were not { disfmarker } not using the neural net . Uh I do n't know . OK , so the other things you have here are uh , trying to improve results from a single { disfmarker } Yeah . Make stuff better . OK . Uh . { vocalsound } Yeah . And CPU memory issues . Yeah . We 've been sort of ignoring that , have n't we ? PhD A : Yeah , so I do n't know . Professor D : But { disfmarker } PhD A : But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we { disfmarker } Professor D : Yeah , but I li Well , I think { disfmarker } My impression { disfmarker } You { disfmarker } you folks have been looking at this more than me . But my impression was that { vocalsound } uh , there was a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a strict constraint on the delay , PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : but beyond that it was kind of that uh using less memory was better , and { vocalsound } using less CPU was better . Something like that , PhD A : Yeah , but { disfmarker } Professor D : right ? PhD A : Yeah . So , yeah , but we 've { disfmarker } I do n't know . We have to get some reference point to where we { disfmarker } Well , what 's a reasonable number ? Perhaps be because if it 's { disfmarker } if it 's too large or { disfmarker } large or @ @ { disfmarker } Professor D : Um , well I do n't think we 're { vocalsound } um { vocalsound } completely off the wall . I mean I think that if we { disfmarker } if we have { disfmarker } Uh , I mean the ultimate fall back that we could do { disfmarker } If we find uh { disfmarker } I mean we may find that we { disfmarker } we 're not really gon na worry about the M L You know , if the MLP ultimately , after all is said and done , does n't really help then we wo n't have it in . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : If the MLP does , we find , help us enough in some conditions , uh , we might even have more than one MLP . We could simply say that is uh , done on the uh , server . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : And it 's uh { disfmarker } We do the other manipulations that we 're doing before that . So , I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I think { disfmarker } I think that 's { disfmarker } { pause } that 's OK . PhD A : And { disfmarker } Yeah . Professor D : So I think the key thing was um , this plug into OGI . Um , what { disfmarker } what are they { disfmarker } What are they gon na be working { disfmarker } Do we know what they 're gon na be working on while we take their features , PhD A : They 're { disfmarker } They 're starting to wor work on some kind of multi - band . Professor D : and { disfmarker } ? PhD A : So . Um { disfmarker } This { disfmarker } that was Pratibha . Sunil , what was he doing , do you remember ? PhD B : Sunil ? PhD A : Yeah . He was doing something new or { disfmarker } ? PhD B : I { disfmarker } I do n't re I did n't remember . Maybe he 's working with { pause } neural network . PhD A : I do n't think so . Trying to tune wha networks ? PhD B : Yeah , I think so . PhD A : I think they were also mainly , well , working a little bit of new things , like networks and multi - band , but mainly trying to tune their { disfmarker } their system as it is now to { disfmarker } just trying to get the best from this { disfmarker } this architecture . PhD B : Yeah . PhD A :  Professor D : OK . So I guess the way it would work is that you 'd get { disfmarker } There 'd be some point where you say , `` OK , this is their version - one `` or whatever , and we get these VAD labels and features and so forth for all these test sets from them , PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : and then um , uh , that 's what we work with . We have a certain level we try to improve it with this other path and then um , uh , when it gets to be uh , January some point uh , we say , `` OK we { disfmarker } we have shown that we can improve this , in this way . So now uh { pause } um { pause } what 's your newest version ? `` And then maybe they 'll have something that 's better and then we { disfmarker } we 'd combine it . This is always hard . I mean I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I used to work { pause } with uh folks who were trying to improve a good uh , HMM system with uh { disfmarker } with a neural net system and uh , it was { pause } a common problem that you 'd { disfmarker } Oh , and this { disfmarker } Actually , this is true not just for neural nets but just for { disfmarker } in general if people were { pause } working with uh , rescoring uh , N - best lists or lattices that come { disfmarker } came from uh , a mainstream recognizer . Uh , You get something from the { disfmarker } the other site at one point and you work really hard on making it better with rescoring . But they 're working really hard , too . So by the time { pause } you have uh , improved their score , they have also improved their score PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : and now there is n't any difference , PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : because the other { disfmarker } PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : So , um , I guess at some point we 'll have to PhD A : So it 's { disfmarker } Professor D : uh { disfmarker } { comment } Uh , I { disfmarker } I do n't know . I think we 're { disfmarker } we 're integrated a little more tightly than happens in a lot of those cases . I think at the moment they { disfmarker } they say that they have a better thing we can { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } e e PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : What takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things , presumably uh , in a { disfmarker } in a day we could turn around uh , taking a new set of things from them and { disfmarker } and rescoring it , PhD A : Mmm . Yeah . Yeah , perhaps we could . Professor D : right ? So . Yeah . Well , OK . No , this is { disfmarker } I think this is good . I think that the most wide open thing is the issues about the uh , you know , different trainings . You know , da training targets and noises and so forth . PhD A : Mmm . So we { disfmarker } we can for { disfmarker } we c we can forget combining multiple features and MLG perhaps , Professor D : That 's sort of wide open . PhD A : or focus more on the targets and on the training data and { disfmarker } ? Professor D : Yeah , I think for right now um , I th I { disfmarker } I really liked MSG . And I think that , you know , one of the things I liked about it is has such different temporal properties . And um , I think that there is ultimately a really good uh , potential for , you know , bringing in things with different temporal properties . Um , but um , uh , we only have limited time and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set and the training targets , and fitting in uh what we 're doing with what they 're doing , and , you know , with limited time . Yeah . I think { pause } we have to start cutting down . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : So uh { disfmarker } I think so , yeah . And then , you know , once we { disfmarker } Um , having gone through this { pause } process and trying many different things , I would imagine that certain things uh , come up that you are curious about uh , that you 'd not getting to and so when the dust settles from the evaluation uh , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested uh and uh { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and work with it , you know , for the next round . Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gon na do is actually gon na completely solve the problem . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : So . So , { comment } there 'll still be plenty to do . Barry , you 've been pretty quiet . Grad C : Just listening . Professor D : Well I figured that , but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } That { disfmarker } what { disfmarker } what { disfmarker } what were you involved in in this primarily ? Grad C : Um , { vocalsound } helping out { vocalsound } uh , preparing { disfmarker } Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been uh , uh w doing some work on the { disfmarker } on the { disfmarker } preparing all { disfmarker } all the data for them to { disfmarker } to um , train and to test on . Um Yeah . Right now , I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class . Professor D : Ah ! Grad C : Yeah . Professor D : I see . Right . What 's { disfmarker } what 's that ? Grad C : Um , { vocalsound } I 'm trying to um { disfmarker } So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this { disfmarker } this multi - band um , belief - net structure . { comment } This guy did { disfmarker } Professor D : Mm - hmm . Grad C : uh basically it was two H M Ms with { disfmarker } with a { disfmarker } with a dependency arrow between the two H M Professor D : Uh - huh . Grad C : And so I wan na try { disfmarker } try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that { disfmarker } that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . I wan na try having the arrows go both ways . And um , { vocalsound } I 'm just gon na see if { disfmarker } if that { disfmarker } that better models { pause } um , uh asynchrony in any way or um { disfmarker } { pause } Yeah . Professor D : Oh ! OK . Well , that sounds interesting . Grad C : Yeah . Professor D : OK . Alright . Anything to { disfmarker } { vocalsound } you wanted to { disfmarker } No . OK . Silent partner in the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } in the meeting . Oh , we got a laugh out of him , that 's good . OK , everyone h must contribute to the { disfmarker } our { disfmarker } our sound { disfmarker } { vocalsound } sound files here . OK , so speaking of which , if we do n't have anything else that we need { disfmarker } You happy with where we are ? PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : Know { disfmarker } know wher know where we 're going ? Uh { disfmarker } PhD A : I think so , yeah . Professor D : Yeah , yeah . You { disfmarker } you happy ? PhD B :  Professor D : You 're happy . OK everyone { pause } should be happy . OK . You do n't have to be happy . You 're almost done . Yeah , yeah . OK . Grad E : Al - actually I should mention { disfmarker } So if { disfmarker } { comment } um , about the Linux machine `` Swede . `` Professor D : Yeah . Grad E : So it looks like the um , neural net tools are installed there . PhD A : Mmm . Grad E : And um Dan Ellis { comment } I believe knows something about using that machine so PhD A : Mmm . Grad E : If people are interested in { disfmarker } in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that . PhD A : Yeah , but I do n't know if we really need now a lot of machines . Well . we could start computing another huge table but { disfmarker } yeah , we { disfmarker } Professor D : Well . Yeah , I think we want a different table , at least PhD A : Yeah , sure . Professor D : Right ? I mean there 's { disfmarker } there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now . PhD A : But { disfmarker } Professor D : But { disfmarker } PhD A : Yeah . Mmm . Professor D : So . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU uh , for training and so on ? Yeah . PhD A : Ah yeah . I think so . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I do n't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know { disfmarker } We just select what works { pause } fine Professor D : OK . OK . PhD A : and try to improve this PhD B : Yeah . to work Professor D : And we 're OK on { disfmarker } And we 're OK on disk ? PhD A : and { disfmarker } It 's OK , yeah . Well sometimes we have some problems . PhD B : Some problems with the { disfmarker } Professor D : But they 're correctable , uh problems . PhD A : Yeah , restarting the script basically PhD B : You know . PhD A : and { disfmarker } Professor D : Yes . Yeah , I 'm familiar with { vocalsound } that one , OK . Alright , so uh , { comment } { vocalsound } since uh , we did n't ha get a channel on for you , { comment } you do n't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . Uh , is it on ? Well . We did n't uh { disfmarker } I think I wo n't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , { pause } pretty easily . OK , thanks . OK , so we 'll uh { disfmarker } I 'll start off the uh um connect the { disfmarker } PhD A : My battery is low . Professor D : Well , let 's hope it works . Maybe you should go first and see so that you 're { disfmarker } OK . PhD B : batteries ? Grad C : Yeah , your battery 's going down too . Professor D : Transcript uh two { disfmarker } Grad C : Carmen 's battery is d going down too . Professor D : Oh , OK . Yeah . Why do n't you go next then . OK . Guess we 're done . OK , uh so . Just finished digits . Yeah , so . Uh Well , it 's good . I think { disfmarker } I guess we can turn off our microphones now . Grad C : Just pull the batteries out . 
Query : Summarize the discussion about the results from the experiments Professor D : OK . PhD A : Mike . Mike - one ? PhD B : Ah . Professor D : We 're on ? Yes , please . I mean , we 're testing noise robustness but let 's not get silly . OK , so , uh , you 've got some , uh , Xerox things to pass out ? PhD A : Yeah , Professor D : That are { disfmarker } PhD A : um . Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sorry for the table , but as it grows in size , uh , it . Professor D : Uh , so for th the last column we use our imagination . OK . PhD B : Ah , yeah . Professor D : Ah . PhD A : Uh , yeah . PhD B : Uh , do you want @ @ . Professor D : This one 's nice , though . This has nice big font . PhD A : Yeah . Grad C : Let 's see . Yeah . Chop ! Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : So Professor D : When you get older you have these different perspectives . I mean , lowering the word hour rate is fine , but having big font ! PhD A : Next time we will put colors or something . Professor D : That 's what 's { disfmarker } PhD A : Uh . Professor D : Yeah . It 's mostly big font . OK . PhD A : OK , s so there is kind of summary of what has been done { disfmarker } Professor D : Uh { disfmarker } Go ahead . PhD A : It 's this . Summary of experiments since , well , since last week Professor D : Oh . OK . PhD A : and also since the { disfmarker } we 've started to run { disfmarker } work on this . Um . { pause } So since last week we 've started to fill the column with um { vocalsound } uh features w with nets trained on PLP with on - line normalization but with delta also , because the column was not completely { disfmarker } Professor D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD A : well , it 's still not completely filled , Professor D :  PhD A : but { pause } we have more results to compare with network using without PLP and { pause } finally , hhh , { comment } um { pause } ehhh { comment } PL - uh delta seems very important . Uh { pause } I do n't know . If you take um , let 's say , anyway Aurora - two - B , so , the next { disfmarker } t the second , uh , part of the table , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : uh { pause } when we use the large training set using French , Spanish , and English , you have one hundred and six without delta and eighty - nine with the delta . Professor D : a And again all of these numbers are with a hundred percent being , uh , the baseline performance , PhD A : Yeah , on the baseline , yeah . So { disfmarker } Professor D : but with a mel cepstra system going straight into the HTK ? PhD A : Yeah . Yeah . So now we see that the gap between the different training set is much { pause } uh uh much smaller Professor D : Yes . PhD A : um { disfmarker } Grad C : It 's out of the way . PhD A : But , actually , um , for English training on TIMIT is still better than the other languages . And Mmm , { pause } Yeah . And f also for Italian , actually . If you take the second set of experiment for Italian , so , the mismatched condition , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : um { pause } when we use the training on TIMIT so , it 's multi - English , we have a ninety - one number , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : and training with other languages is a little bit worse . Professor D : Um { disfmarker } Oh , I see . Down near the bottom of this sheet . PhD A : So , Professor D : Uh , { comment } { pause } yes . PhD A : yeah . Professor D : OK . PhD A : And , yeah , and here the gap is still more important between using delta and not using delta . If y if I take the training s the large training set , it 's { disfmarker } we have one hundred and seventy - two , Professor D : Yes . PhD A : and one hundred and four when we use delta . Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : Uh . { pause } Even if the contexts used is quite the same , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : because without delta we use seventeenths { disfmarker } seventeen frames . Uh . Yeah , um , so the second point is that we have no single cross - language experiments , uh , that we did not have last week . Uh , so this is training the net on French only , or on English only , and testing on Italian . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : And training the net on French only and Spanish only and testing on , uh TI - digits . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : And , fff { comment } um , yeah . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from { comment } uh English digits , and from Italian digits . So this is the { disfmarker } another line { disfmarker } another set of lines in the table . Uh , @ @ with SPINE Professor D : Ah , yes . Mm - hmm . PhD A : and { pause } uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , uh , so we have to to redo the uh { disfmarker } the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . But Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : um this { disfmarker } this net performed quite well . Well , it 's { disfmarker } it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh . So , uh , yeah . We have also started feature combination experiments . Uh many experiments using features and net outputs together . And this is { disfmarker } The results are on the other document . Uh , we can discuss this after , perhaps { disfmarker } well , just , @ @ . Yeah , so basically there are four { disfmarker } four kind of systems . The first one , yeah , is combining , um , two feature streams , uh using { disfmarker } and each feature stream has its own MPL . So it 's the { disfmarker } kind of similar to the tandem that was proposed for the first . The multi - stream tandem for the first proposal . The second is using features and KLT transformed MLP outputs . And the third one is to u use a single KLT trans transform features as well as MLP outputs . Um , yeah . Mmm . You know you can { disfmarker } you can comment these results , PhD B : Yes , I can s I would like to say that , for example , um , mmm , if we does n't use the delta - delta , uh we have an improve when we use s some combination . But when PhD A : Yeah , we ju just to be clear , the numbers here are uh recognition accuracy . PhD B : w Yeah , this { disfmarker } Yeah , this number recognition acc PhD A : So it 's not the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Again we switch to another { disfmarker } PhD B : Yes , and the baseline { disfmarker } the baseline have { disfmarker } i is eighty - two . Professor D : Baseline is eighty - two . PhD B : Yeah PhD A : So it 's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this . Professor D : Uh , this is Italian mismatched . PhD A : Um . PhD B : Yeah , by the moment . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : OK . PhD B : And first in the experiment - one I { disfmarker } I do { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I use different MLP , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and is obviously that the multi - English MLP is the better . Um . for the ne { disfmarker } rest of experiment I use multi - English , only multi - English . And I try to combine different type of feature , but the result is that the MSG - three feature does n't work for the Italian database because never help to increase the accuracy . PhD A : Yeah , eh , actually , if w we look at the table , the huge table , um , we see that for TI - digits MSG perform as well as the PLP , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : but this is not the case for Italian what { disfmarker } where the error rate is c is almost uh twice the error rate of PLP . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : So , um { vocalsound } uh , well , I do n't think this is a bug but this { disfmarker } this is something in { disfmarker } probably in the MSG um process that uh I do n't know what exactly . Perhaps the fact that the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } there 's no low - pass filter , well , or no pre - emp pre - emphasis filter and that there is some DC offset in the Italian , or , well , something simple like that . But { disfmarker } that we need to sort out if want to uh get improvement by combining PLP and MSG Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : because for the moment MSG do does n't bring much information . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : And as Carmen said , if we combine the two , we have the result , basically , of PLP . Professor D : I Um , the uh , baseline system { disfmarker } when you said the baseline system was uh , uh eighty - two percent , that was trained on what and tested on what ? That was , uh Italian mismatched d uh , uh , digits , uh , is the testing , PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : and the training is Italian digits ? PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : So the `` mismatch `` just refers to the noise and { disfmarker } and , uh microphone and so forth , PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : right ? So , um did we have { disfmarker } So would that then correspond to the first line here of where the training is { disfmarker } is the uh Italian digits ? PhD B : The train the training of the HTK ? Professor D : The { disfmarker } PhD B : Yes . Ah yes ! Professor D : Yes . PhD B : This h Yes . Th - Yes . Professor D : Yes . Training of the net , PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : yeah . So , um { disfmarker } So what that says is that in a matched condition , { vocalsound } we end up with a fair amount worse putting in the uh PLP . Now w would { disfmarker } do we have a number , I suppose for the matched { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I do n't mean matched , but uh use of Italian { disfmarker } training in Italian digits for PLP only ? PhD B : Uh { pause } yes ? PhD A : Uh { pause } yeah , so this is { disfmarker } basically this is in the table . Uh { pause } so the number is fifty - two , PhD B : Another table . PhD A : uh { disfmarker } Professor D : Fifty - two percent . PhD A : Fift - So { disfmarker } No , it 's { disfmarker } it 's the { disfmarker } PhD B : No . Professor D : No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ? PhD A : Of { disfmarker } of { disfmarker } of uh { pause } eighteen { disfmarker } PhD B : Eighty . PhD A : of eighteen . PhD B : Eighty . PhD A : So it 's { disfmarker } it 's error rate , basically . PhD B : It 's plus six . PhD A : It 's er error rate ratio . So { disfmarker } Professor D : Oh this is accuracy ! PhD A : Uh , so we have nine { disfmarker } nine { disfmarker } let 's say ninety percent . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : Oy ! { comment } OK . Ninety . PhD A : Yeah . Um { comment } which is uh { comment } what we have also if use PLP and MSG together , Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : eighty - nine point seven . Professor D : OK , so even just PLP , uh , it is not , in the matched condition { disfmarker } Um I wonder if it 's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra , or whether it 's that the net half , for some reason , is not helping . PhD A : Uh . P - PLP and Mel cepstra give the same { disfmarker } same results . Professor D : Same result pretty much ? PhD A : Well , we have these results . I do n't know . It 's not { disfmarker } Do you have this result with PLP alone , { comment } j fee feeding HTK ? Professor D : So , s PhD A : That { disfmarker } That 's what you mean ? PhD B : Yeah , PhD A : Just PLP at the input of HTK . PhD B : yeah yeah yeah yeah , at the first { disfmarker } and the { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD A : Yeah . So , PLP { disfmarker } Professor D : Eighty - eight point six . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Um , so adding MSG PhD A : Um { disfmarker } Professor D : um { disfmarker } Well , but that 's { disfmarker } yeah , that 's without the neural net , PhD A : Yeah , that 's without the neural net Professor D : right ? PhD A : and that 's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization . Professor D : But she had said eighty - two . PhD A : This is the { disfmarker } w well , but this is without on - line normalization . Professor D : Right ? Oh , this { disfmarker } the eighty - two . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B :  PhD A : Eighty - two is the { disfmarker } it 's the Aurora baseline , so MFCC . Then we can use { disfmarker } well , OGI , they use MFCC { disfmarker } th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization Professor D : Oh , I 'm sorry , I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy . PhD A : Yeah , sorry . Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : OK . Alright . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Alright . So this is { disfmarker } I was thinking all this was worse . OK so this is all better PhD B : Yes , better . Professor D : because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : OK . I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm all better now . OK , go ahead . PhD A : So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent . Professor D : Yeah . Mm - hmm . PhD A : Uh , when we apply a neural network , is the same . We j jump to ninety percent . PhD B : Nnn , we do n't know exactly . Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : And { disfmarker } And um { disfmarker } whatever the normalization , actually . If we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent . So { disfmarker } Professor D : So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to { disfmarker } to ninety , or something . PhD A : Well , ninety { disfmarker } No , I { disfmarker } I mean ninety It 's around eighty - nine , ninety , eighty - eight . Professor D : Eighty - nine . PhD A : Well , there are minor { disfmarker } minor differences . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : And then adding the MSG does nothing , basically . PhD A : No . Professor D : Yeah . OK . PhD A : Uh For Italian , yeah . Professor D : For this case , right ? PhD A : Um . Professor D : Alright . So , um { disfmarker } So actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG , if you { disfmarker } uh does not help in that case . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Um { disfmarker } PhD A : But w Yeah . Professor D : The other ones , we 'd have to look at it , but { disfmarker } And the multi - English , does uh { disfmarker } So if we think of this in error rates , we start off with , uh eighteen percent error rate , roughly . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Um { pause } and { pause } we uh almost , uh cut that in half by um putting in the on - line normalization and the neural net . PhD A : Yeah Professor D : And the MSG does n't however particularly affect things . PhD A : No . Professor D : And we cut off , I guess about twenty - five percent of the error . Uh { pause } no , not quite that , is it . Uh , two point six out of eighteen . About , um { pause } sixteen percent or something of the error , um , if we use multi - English instead of the matching condition . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Yeah . Professor D : Not matching condition , but uh , the uh , Italian training . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : OK . PhD A : Mmm . PhD B : We select these { disfmarker } these { disfmarker } these tasks because it 's the more difficult . Professor D : Yes , good . OK ? So then you 're assuming multi - English is closer to the kind of thing that you could use since you 're not gon na have matching , uh , data for the { disfmarker } uh for the new { disfmarker } for the other languages and so forth . Um , one qu thing is that , uh { disfmarker } I think I asked you this before , but I wan na double check . When you say `` ME `` in these other tests , that 's the multi - English , PhD A : That 's { disfmarker } it 's a part { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } Professor D : but it is not all of the multi - English , right ? It is some piece of { disfmarker } part of it . PhD A : Or , one million frames . Professor D : And the multi - English is how much ? PhD B : You have here the information . PhD A : It 's one million and a half . Yeah . Professor D : Oh , so you used almost all You used two thirds of it , PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : you think . So , it it 's still { disfmarker } it hurts you { disfmarker } seems to hurt you a fair amount to add in this French and Spanish . PhD A : Mmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : I wonder why Yeah . Uh . Grad C : Well Stephane was saying that they were n't hand - labeled , PhD A : Yeah , it 's { disfmarker } PhD B : Yeah . PhD A : Yeah . Grad C : the French and the Spanish . PhD B : The Spanish . Maybe for that . Professor D : Hmm . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : It 's still { disfmarker } OK . Alright , go ahead . And then { disfmarker } then { disfmarker } PhD B : Um . Mmm , with the experiment type - two , I { disfmarker } first I tried to to combine , nnn , some feature from the MLP and other feature { disfmarker } another feature . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : And we s we can { disfmarker } first the feature are without delta and delta - delta , and we can see that in the situation , uh , the MSG - three , the same help nothing . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : And then I do the same but with the delta and delta - delta { disfmarker } PLP delta and delta - delta . And they all p but they all put off the MLP is it without delta and delta - delta . And we have a l little bit less result than the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the baseline PLP with delta and delta - delta . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Maybe if { disfmarker } when we have the new { disfmarker } the new { pause } neural network trained with PLP delta and delta - delta , maybe the final result must be better . I do n't know . PhD A : Actually , just to be some more { disfmarker } PhD B : Uh { disfmarker } PhD A : Do This number , this eighty - seven point one number , has to be compared with the Professor D : Yes , yeah , I mean it ca n't be compared with the other PhD A : Which number ? Professor D : cuz this is , uh { disfmarker } with multi - English , uh , training . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor D : So you have to compare it with the one over that you 've got in a box , which is that , uh the eighty - four point six . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Right ? PhD A : Uh . Professor D : So { disfmarker } PhD A : Yeah , but I mean in this case for the eighty - seven point one we used MLP outputs for the PLP net Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : and straight features with delta - delta . And straight features with delta - delta gives you what 's on the first sheet . PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor D : Yeah . Not t not PhD A : It 's eight eighty - eight point six . Professor D : tr No . No . No . PhD B : Yes . Professor D : Not trained with multi - English . PhD A : Uh , yeah , but th this is the second configuration . PhD B : No , but they { disfmarker } they feature @ @ without { disfmarker } PhD A : So we use feature out uh , net outputs together with features . So yeah , this is not { disfmarker } perhaps not clear here but in this table , the first column is for MLP and the second for the features . Professor D : Eh . { comment } Oh , I see . Ah . So you 're saying w so asking the question , `` What { disfmarker } what has adding the MLP done to improve over the , PhD A : So , just { disfmarker } Yeah so , actually it { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } it decreased the { disfmarker } the accuracy . Professor D : uh { disfmarker } PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : Yes . PhD A : Because we have eighty - eight point six . Professor D : Uh - huh . PhD A : And even the MLP alone { disfmarker } What gives the MLP alone ? Multi - English PLP . Oh no , it gives eighty - three point six . So we have our eighty - three point six and now eighty - eighty point six , PhD B : But { disfmarker } PhD A : that gives eighty - seven point one . Professor D : Mm - hmm . Eighty - s I thought it was eighty Oh , OK , eighty - three point six and eighty { disfmarker } eighty - eight point six . PhD A : Eighty - three point six . Eighty { disfmarker } Professor D : OK . PhD A : Is th is that right ? Yeah ? PhD B : Yeah . But { disfmarker } I do n't know { disfmarker } but maybe if we have the neural network trained with the PLP { pause } delta and delta - delta , maybe tha this can help . PhD A : Perhaps , yeah . Professor D : Well , that 's { disfmarker } that 's one thing , but see the other thing is that , um , I mean it 's good to take the difficult case , but let 's { disfmarker } let 's consider what that means . What { disfmarker } what we 're saying is that one o one of the things that { disfmarker } I mean my interpretation of your { disfmarker } your s original suggestion is something like this , as motivation . When we train on data that is in one sense or another , similar to the testing data , then we get a win by having discriminant training . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : When we train on something that 's quite different , we have a potential to have some problems . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : And , um , if we get something that helps us when it 's somewhat similar , and does n't hurt us too much when it { disfmarker } when it 's quite different , that 's maybe not so bad . PhD A : Yeah . Mmm . Professor D : So the question is , if you took the same combination , and you tried it out on , uh { disfmarker } on say digits , PhD A : On TI - digits ? OK . Professor D : you know , d Was that experiment done ? PhD A : No , not yet . Professor D : Yeah , OK . Uh , then does that , eh { disfmarker } you know maybe with similar noise conditions and so forth , { comment } does it { disfmarker } does it then look much better ? PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : And so what is the range over these different kinds of uh { disfmarker } of tests ? So , an anyway . OK , go ahead . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : And , with this type of configuration which I do on experiment using the new neural net with name broad klatt s twenty - seven , uh , d I have found more or less the same result . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : So , it 's slightly better , PhD B : Little bit better ? PhD A : yeah . Professor D : Slightly better . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : Slightly bet better . Yes , is better . Professor D : And { disfmarker } and you know again maybe if you use the , uh , delta { pause } there , uh , you would bring it up to where it was , uh you know at least about the same for a difficult case . PhD B : Yeah , maybe . Maybe . Maybe . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B : Oh , yeah . PhD A : Yeah . Well , so perhaps let 's { disfmarker } let 's jump at the last experiment . PhD B : Oh , yeah . Professor D : So . PhD A : It 's either less information from the neural network if we use only the silence output . PhD B : i Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : It 's again better . So it 's eighty - nine point { disfmarker } point one . PhD B : Yeah , Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD B : and we have only forty { disfmarker } forty feature PhD A : So . PhD B : because in this situation we have one hundred and three feature . Professor D : Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . And then w with the first configuration , I f I am found that work , uh , does n't work { disfmarker } Professor D : Yeah . PhD B : uh , well , work , but is better , the second configuration . Because I { disfmarker } for the del Engli - PLP delta and delta - delta , here I have eighty - five point three accuracy , and with the second configuration I have eighty - seven point one . 
Query : What did the Professor think about the results ? Professor D : Alright . So this is { disfmarker } I was thinking all this was worse . OK so this is all better PhD B : Yes , better . Professor D : because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : OK . I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm all better now . OK , go ahead . PhD A : So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent . Professor D : Yeah . Mm - hmm . PhD A : Uh , when we apply a neural network , is the same . We j jump to ninety percent . PhD B : Nnn , we do n't know exactly . Professor D : Yeah .

PhD A : Well , there are minor { disfmarker } minor differences . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : And then adding the MSG does nothing , basically . PhD A : No . Professor D : Yeah . OK . PhD A : Uh For Italian , yeah . Professor D : For this case , right ? PhD A : Um . Professor D : Alright . So , um { disfmarker } So actually , the answer for experiments with one is that adding MSG , if you { disfmarker } uh does not help in that case . PhD A : Mm - hmm .

Grad C : Well Stephane was saying that they were n't hand - labeled , 
Query : What did PhD A think about the results ? PhD A : And , fff { comment } um , yeah . What we see is that these nets are not as good , except for the multi - English , which is always one of the best . Yeah , then we started to work on a large dat database containing , uh , sentences from the French , from the Spanish , from the TIMIT , from SPINE , uh from { comment } uh English digits , and from Italian digits . So this is the { disfmarker } another line { disfmarker } another set of lines in the table . Uh , @ @ with SPINE Professor D : Ah , yes . Mm - hmm . PhD A : and { pause } uh , actually we did this before knowing the result of all the data , uh , so we have to to redo the uh { disfmarker } the experiment training the net with , uh PLP , but with delta . But Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : um this { disfmarker } this net performed quite well . Well , it 's { disfmarker } it 's better than the net using French , Spanish , and English only . Uh .

Professor D : Baseline is eighty - two . PhD B : Yeah PhD A : So it 's experiment only on the Italian mismatched for the moment for this . Professor D : Uh , this is Italian mismatched . PhD A : Um . PhD B : Yeah , by the moment . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : OK . PhD B : And first in the experiment - one I { disfmarker } I do { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I use different MLP , Professor D : Mm - hmm .

Professor D : I Um , the uh , baseline system { disfmarker } when you said the baseline system was uh , uh eighty - two percent , that was trained on what and tested on what ? That was , uh Italian mismatched d uh , uh , digits , uh , is the testing , PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : and the training is Italian digits ? PhD B : Yeah .

PhD B : Uh { pause } yes ? PhD A : Uh { pause } yeah , so this is { disfmarker } basically this is in the table . Uh { pause } so the number is fifty - two , PhD B : Another table . PhD A : uh { disfmarker } Professor D : Fifty - two percent . PhD A : Fift - So { disfmarker } No , it 's { disfmarker } it 's the { disfmarker } PhD B : No . Professor D : No , fifty - two percent of eighty - two ? PhD A : Of { disfmarker } of { disfmarker } of uh { pause } eighteen { disfmarker } PhD B : Eighty . PhD A : of eighteen . PhD B : Eighty . PhD A : So it 's { disfmarker } it 's error rate , basically . PhD B : It 's plus six . PhD A : It 's er error rate ratio . So { disfmarker } Professor D : Oh this is accuracy ! PhD A : Uh , so we have nine { disfmarker } nine { disfmarker } let 's say ninety percent . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : Oy ! { comment } OK . Ninety . PhD A : Yeah . Um { comment } which is uh { comment } what we have also if use PLP and MSG together , Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : eighty - nine point seven . Professor D : OK , so even just PLP , uh , it is not , in the matched condition { disfmarker } Um I wonder if it 's a difference between PLP and mel cepstra , or whether it 's that the net half , for some reason , is not helping . PhD A : Uh . P - PLP and Mel cepstra give the same { disfmarker } same results . Professor D : Same result pretty much ? PhD A : Well , we have these results . I do n't know . It 's not { disfmarker } Do you have this result with PLP alone , { comment } j fee feeding HTK ? Professor D : So , s PhD A : That { disfmarker } That 's what you mean ? PhD B : Yeah , PhD A : Just PLP at the input of HTK . PhD B : yeah yeah yeah yeah , at the first { disfmarker } and the { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD A : Yeah . So , PLP { disfmarker } Professor D : Eighty - eight point six . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Um , so adding MSG PhD A : Um { disfmarker } Professor D : um { disfmarker } Well , but that 's { disfmarker } yeah , that 's without the neural net , PhD A : Yeah , that 's without the neural net Professor D : right ? PhD A : and that 's the result basically that OGI has also with the MFCC with on - line normalization . Professor D : But she had said eighty - two . PhD A : This is the { disfmarker } w well , but this is without on - line normalization . Professor D : Right ? Oh , this { disfmarker } the eighty - two . PhD A : Yeah . PhD B :  PhD A : Eighty - two is the { disfmarker } it 's the Aurora baseline , so MFCC . Then we can use { disfmarker } well , OGI , they use MFCC { disfmarker } th the baseline MFCC plus on - line normalization Professor D : Oh , I 'm sorry , I k I keep getting confused because this is accuracy . PhD A : Yeah , sorry . Yeah . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : OK . Alright . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Alright . So this is { disfmarker } I was thinking all this was worse . OK so this is all better PhD B : Yes , better . Professor D : because eighty - nine is bigger than eighty - two . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : OK . I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm all better now . OK , go ahead . PhD A : So what happ what happens is that when we apply on - line normalization we jump to almost ninety percent . Professor D : Yeah . Mm - hmm . PhD A : Uh , when we apply a neural network , is the same . We j jump to ninety percent . PhD B : Nnn , we do n't know exactly . Professor D : Yeah . PhD A : And { disfmarker } And um { disfmarker } whatever the normalization , actually . If we use n neural network , even if the features are not correctly normalized , we jump to ninety percent . So { disfmarker } Professor D : So we go from eighty - si eighty - eight point six to { disfmarker } to ninety , or something . PhD A : Well , ninety { disfmarker } No , I { disfmarker } I mean ninety It 's around eighty - nine , ninety , eighty - eight . 
Query : Summarize the discussion on future directions PhD A : Yeah . f But , yeah . Professor D : Uh . But it 's another thing to try . PhD A : So , this is w w i wa wa this is one thing , this { disfmarker } this could be { disfmarker } could help { disfmarker } could help perhaps to reduce language dependency and for the noise part um we could combine this with other approaches , like , well , the Kleinschmidt approach . So the d the idea of putting all the noise that we can find inside a database . I think Kleinschmidt was using more than fifty different noises to train his network , PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : and { disfmarker } So this is one { vocalsound } approach and the other is multi - band { vocalsound } { vocalsound } uh , that I think is more robust to the noisy changes . Professor D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . PhD A : So perhaps , I think something like multi - band trained on a lot of noises with uh , features - based targets could { disfmarker } could { disfmarker } could help . Professor D : Yeah , if you { disfmarker } i i It 's interesting thought maybe if you just trained up { disfmarker } I mean w yeah , one { disfmarker } one fantasy would be you have something like articulatory targets and you have { pause } um some reasonable database , um but then { disfmarker } which is um { vocalsound } copied over many times with a range of different noises , PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : And uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } If { disfmarker } Cuz what you 're trying to { pause } do is come up with a { disfmarker } a core , reasonable feature set which is then gon na be used uh , by the { disfmarker } the uh HMM { pause } system . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : So . Yeah , OK . PhD A : So , um , yeah . The future work is , { pause } well , try to connect to the { disfmarker } to make { disfmarker } to plug in the system to the OGI system . Um , there are still open questions there , where to put the MLP basically . Professor D : Mm - hmm . PhD A : Um . Professor D : And I guess , you know , the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the real open question , I mean , e u there 's lots of open questions , but one of the core quote { comment } `` open questions `` for that is um , um , if we take the uh { disfmarker } you know , the best ones here , maybe not just the best one , but the best few or something { disfmarker } You want the most promising group from these other experiments . Um , how well do they do over a range of these different tests , not just the Italian ? PhD A : Mmm , Professor D : Um . And y PhD A : Yeah , yeah . Professor D : y { pause } Right ? And then um { disfmarker } then see , { pause } again , how { disfmarker } We know that there 's a mis there 's a uh { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a loss in performance when the neural net is trained on conditions that are different than { disfmarker } than , uh we 're gon na test on , but well , if you look over a range of these different tests um , how well do these different ways of combining the straight features with the MLP features , uh stand up over that range ? PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor D : That 's { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } that seems like the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the real question . And if you know that { disfmarker } So if you just take PLP with uh , the double - deltas . Assume that 's the p the feature . look at these different ways of combining it . And uh , take { disfmarker } let 's say , just take uh multi - English cause that works pretty well for the training . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : And just look { disfmarker } take that case and then look over all the different things . How does that { disfmarker } How does that compare between the { disfmarker } PhD A : So all the { disfmarker } all the test sets you mean , yeah . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : All the different test sets , PhD A : And { disfmarker } Professor D : and for { disfmarker } and for the couple different ways that you have of { disfmarker } of { disfmarker } of combining them . PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Um . { pause } How well do they stand up , over the { disfmarker } PhD A : Mmm . And perhaps doing this for { disfmarker } cha changing the variance of the streams and so on { pause } getting different scaling { disfmarker } PhD B : Mm - hmm . Professor D : That 's another possibility if you have time , yeah . Yeah . PhD A : Um . Yeah , so thi this sh would be more working on the MLP as an additional path instead of an insert to the { disfmarker } to their diagram . Professor D :  PhD A : Cuz { disfmarker } Yeah . Perhaps the insert idea is kind of strange because nnn , they { disfmarker } they make LDA and then we will again add a network does discriminate anal nnn , that discriminates , Professor D : Yeah . { pause } It 's a little strange PhD A : or { disfmarker } ? Mmm ? Professor D : but on the other hand they did it before . PhD A : Mmm . And { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and Professor D : Um the PhD A : yeah . And because also perhaps we know that the { disfmarker } when we have very good features the MLP does n't help . So . I do n't know . Professor D : Um , the other thing , though , is that um { disfmarker } So . Uh , we { disfmarker } we wan na get their path running here , right ? If so , we can add this other stuff . PhD A : Um . Professor D : as an additional path right ? PhD A : Yeah , the { disfmarker } the way we want to do { disfmarker } Professor D : Cuz they 're doing LDA { pause } RASTA . PhD A : The d What ? Professor D : They 're doing LDA RASTA , PhD A : Yeah , the way we want to do it perhaps is to { disfmarker } just to get the VAD labels and the final features . Professor D : yeah ? PhD A : So they will send us the { disfmarker } Well , provide us with the feature files , Professor D : I see . I see . PhD A : and with VAD uh , binary labels so that we can uh , get our MLP features and filter them with the VAD and then combine them with their f feature stream . So . Professor D : I see . So we { disfmarker } So . First thing of course we 'd wan na do there is to make sure that when we get those labels of final features is that we get the same results as them . Without putting in a second path . PhD A : Uh . You mean { disfmarker } Oh , yeah ! Just re re retraining r retraining the HTK ? Professor D : Yeah just th w i i Just to make sure that we { pause } have { disfmarker } we understand properly what things are , our very first thing to do is to { disfmarker } is to double check that we get the exact same results as them on HTK . PhD A : Oh yeah . Yeah , OK . Mmm . PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : Uh , I mean , I do n't know that we need to r PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : Um { pause } Do we need to retrain I mean we can just take the re their training files also . But . { pause } But , uh just for the testing , jus just make sure that we get the same results { pause } so we can duplicate it before we add in another { disfmarker } PhD A : Mmm . OK . Professor D : Cuz otherwise , you know , we wo n't know what things mean . PhD A : Oh , yeah . OK . And um . Yeah , so fff , LogRASTA , I do n't know if we want to { disfmarker } We can try { pause } networks with LogRASTA filtered features . Professor D : Maybe . PhD A : Mmm . I 'm sorry ? Yeah . Well { disfmarker } Yeah . But { disfmarker } Professor D : Oh ! You know , the other thing is when you say comb I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm sorry , I 'm interrupting . { comment } that u Um , uh , when you 're talking about combining multiple features , um { disfmarker } Suppose we said , `` OK , we 've got these different features and so forth , but PLP seems { pause } pretty good . `` If we take the approach that Mike did and have { disfmarker } PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : I mean , one of the situations we have is we have these different conditions . We have different languages , we have different { disfmarker } { vocalsound } different noises , Um { pause } If we have some drastically different conditions and we just train up different M L Ps { pause } with them . PhD A :  Professor D : And put { disfmarker } put them together . What { disfmarker } what { disfmarker } What Mike found , for the reverberation case at least , I mean { disfmarker } I mean , who knows if it 'll work for these other ones . That you did have nice interpolative effects . That is , that yes , if you knew { pause } what the reverberation condition was gon na be and you trained for that , then you got the best results . But if you had , say , a heavily - reverberation ca heavy - reverberation case and a no - reverberation case , uh , and then you fed the thing , uh something that was a modest amount of reverberation then you 'd get some result in between the two . So it was sort of { disfmarker } behaved reasonably . Is tha that a fair { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD A : Yeah . So you { disfmarker } you think it 's perhaps better to have several M L Yeah but { disfmarker } Professor D : It works better if { pause } what ? PhD A : Yea Professor D : I see . Well , see , i oc You were doing some something that was { disfmarker } So maybe the analogy is n't quite right . You were doing something that was in way a little better behaved . You had reverb for a single variable which was re uh , uh , reverberation . Here the problem seems to be is that we do n't have a hug a really huge net with a really huge amount of training data . But we have s f { pause } for this kind of task , I would think , { pause } sort of a modest amount . I mean , a million frames actually is n't that much . We have a modest amount of { disfmarker } of uh training data from a couple different conditions , and then uh { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } yeah , that { disfmarker } and the real situation is that there 's enormous variability that we anticipate in the test set in terms of language , and noise type uh , and uh , { pause } uh , channel characteristic , sort of all over the map . A bunch of different dimensions . And so , I 'm just concerned that we do n't really have { pause } um , the data to train up { disfmarker } I mean one of the things that we were seeing is that when we added in { disfmarker } we still do n't have a good explanation for this , but we are seeing that we 're adding in uh , a fe few different databases and uh the performance is getting worse and uh , when we just take one of those databases that 's a pretty good one , it actually is { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } is better . And uh that says to me , yes , that , you know , there might be some problems with the pronunciation models that some of the databases we 're adding in or something like that . But one way or another { pause } we do n't have uh , seemingly , the ability { pause } to represent , in the neural net of the size that we have , um , all of the variability { pause } that we 're gon na be covering . So that I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm hoping that um , this is another take on the efficiency argument you 're making , which is I 'm hoping that with moderate size neural nets , uh , that uh if we { disfmarker } if they look at more constrained conditions they { disfmarker } they 'll have enough parameters to really represent them . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . PhD A : So doing both is { disfmarker } is not { disfmarker } is not right , you mean , or { disfmarker } ? Yeah . Professor D : Yeah . I { disfmarker } I just sort of have a feeling { disfmarker } PhD A : But { disfmarker } Yeah . Mm - hmm . Professor D : Yeah . I mean { disfmarker } { vocalsound } i i e The um { disfmarker } I think it 's true that the OGI folk found that using LDA { pause } RASTA , which is a kind of LogRASTA , it 's just that they have the { disfmarker } I mean it 's done in the log domain , as I recall , and it 's { disfmarker } it uh { disfmarker } it 's just that they d it 's trained up , right ? That that um benefitted from on - line normalization . So they did { disfmarker } At least in their case , it did seem to be somewhat complimentary . So will it be in our case , where we 're using the neural net ? I mean they { disfmarker } they were not { disfmarker } not using the neural net . Uh I do n't know . OK , so the other things you have here are uh , trying to improve results from a single { disfmarker } Yeah . Make stuff better . OK . Uh . { vocalsound } Yeah . And CPU memory issues . Yeah . We 've been sort of ignoring that , have n't we ? PhD A : Yeah , so I do n't know . Professor D : But { disfmarker } PhD A : But we have to address the problem of CPU and memory we { disfmarker } Professor D : Yeah , but I li Well , I think { disfmarker } My impression { disfmarker } You { disfmarker } you folks have been looking at this more than me . But my impression was that { vocalsound } uh , there was a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a strict constraint on the delay , PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : but beyond that it was kind of that uh using less memory was better , and { vocalsound } using less CPU was better . Something like that , PhD A : Yeah , but { disfmarker } Professor D : right ? PhD A : Yeah . So , yeah , but we 've { disfmarker } I do n't know . We have to get some reference point to where we { disfmarker } Well , what 's a reasonable number ? Perhaps be because if it 's { disfmarker } if it 's too large or { disfmarker } large or @ @ { disfmarker } Professor D : Um , well I do n't think we 're { vocalsound } um { vocalsound } completely off the wall . I mean I think that if we { disfmarker } if we have { disfmarker } Uh , I mean the ultimate fall back that we could do { disfmarker } If we find uh { disfmarker } I mean we may find that we { disfmarker } we 're not really gon na worry about the M L You know , if the MLP ultimately , after all is said and done , does n't really help then we wo n't have it in . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : If the MLP does , we find , help us enough in some conditions , uh , we might even have more than one MLP . We could simply say that is uh , done on the uh , server . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : And it 's uh { disfmarker } We do the other manipulations that we 're doing before that . So , I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I think { disfmarker } I think that 's { disfmarker } { pause } that 's OK . PhD A : And { disfmarker } Yeah . Professor D : So I think the key thing was um , this plug into OGI . Um , what { disfmarker } what are they { disfmarker } What are they gon na be working { disfmarker } Do we know what they 're gon na be working on while we take their features , PhD A : They 're { disfmarker } They 're starting to wor work on some kind of multi - band . Professor D : and { disfmarker } ? PhD A : So . Um { disfmarker } This { disfmarker } that was Pratibha . Sunil , what was he doing , do you remember ? PhD B : Sunil ? PhD A : Yeah . He was doing something new or { disfmarker } ? PhD B : I { disfmarker } I do n't re I did n't remember . Maybe he 's working with { pause } neural network . PhD A : I do n't think so . Trying to tune wha networks ? PhD B : Yeah , I think so . PhD A : I think they were also mainly , well , working a little bit of new things , like networks and multi - band , but mainly trying to tune their { disfmarker } their system as it is now to { disfmarker } just trying to get the best from this { disfmarker } this architecture . PhD B : Yeah . PhD A :  Professor D : OK . So I guess the way it would work is that you 'd get { disfmarker } There 'd be some point where you say , `` OK , this is their version - one `` or whatever , and we get these VAD labels and features and so forth for all these test sets from them , PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor D : and then um , uh , that 's what we work with . We have a certain level we try to improve it with this other path and then um , uh , when it gets to be uh , January some point uh , we say , `` OK we { disfmarker } we have shown that we can improve this , in this way . So now uh { pause } um { pause } what 's your newest version ? `` And then maybe they 'll have something that 's better and then we { disfmarker } we 'd combine it . This is always hard . I mean I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I used to work { pause } with uh folks who were trying to improve a good uh , HMM system with uh { disfmarker } with a neural net system and uh , it was { pause } a common problem that you 'd { disfmarker } Oh , and this { disfmarker } Actually , this is true not just for neural nets but just for { disfmarker } in general if people were { pause } working with uh , rescoring uh , N - best lists or lattices that come { disfmarker } came from uh , a mainstream recognizer . Uh , You get something from the { disfmarker } the other site at one point and you work really hard on making it better with rescoring . But they 're working really hard , too . So by the time { pause } you have uh , improved their score , they have also improved their score PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : and now there is n't any difference , PhD A : Yeah . Professor D : because the other { disfmarker } PhD B : Yeah . Professor D : So , um , I guess at some point we 'll have to PhD A : So it 's { disfmarker } Professor D : uh { disfmarker } { comment } Uh , I { disfmarker } I do n't know . I think we 're { disfmarker } we 're integrated a little more tightly than happens in a lot of those cases . I think at the moment they { disfmarker } they say that they have a better thing we can { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } e e PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : What takes all the time here is that th we 're trying so many things , presumably uh , in a { disfmarker } in a day we could turn around uh , taking a new set of things from them and { disfmarker } and rescoring it , PhD A : Mmm . Yeah . Yeah , perhaps we could . Professor D : right ? So . Yeah . Well , OK . No , this is { disfmarker } I think this is good . I think that the most wide open thing is the issues about the uh , you know , different trainings . You know , da training targets and noises and so forth . PhD A : Mmm . So we { disfmarker } we can for { disfmarker } we c we can forget combining multiple features and MLG perhaps , Professor D : That 's sort of wide open . PhD A : or focus more on the targets and on the training data and { disfmarker } ? Professor D : Yeah , I think for right now um , I th I { disfmarker } I really liked MSG . And I think that , you know , one of the things I liked about it is has such different temporal properties . And um , I think that there is ultimately a really good uh , potential for , you know , bringing in things with different temporal properties . Um , but um , uh , we only have limited time and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set and the training targets , and fitting in uh what we 're doing with what they 're doing , and , you know , with limited time . Yeah . I think { pause } we have to start cutting down . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : So uh { disfmarker } I think so , yeah . And then , you know , once we { disfmarker } Um , having gone through this { pause } process and trying many different things , I would imagine that certain things uh , come up that you are curious about uh , that you 'd not getting to and so when the dust settles from the evaluation uh , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested uh and uh { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and work with it , you know , for the next round . Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gon na do is actually gon na completely solve the problem . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : So . So , { comment } there 'll still be plenty to do . Barry , you 've been pretty quiet . Grad C : Just listening . Professor D : Well I figured that , but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } That { disfmarker } what { disfmarker } what { disfmarker } what were you involved in in this primarily ? Grad C : Um , { vocalsound } helping out { vocalsound } uh , preparing { disfmarker } Well , they 've been kind of running all the experiments and stuff and I 've been uh , uh w doing some work on the { disfmarker } on the { disfmarker } preparing all { disfmarker } all the data for them to { disfmarker } to um , train and to test on . Um Yeah . Right now , I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm focusing mainly on this final project I 'm working on in Jordan 's class . Professor D : Ah ! Grad C : Yeah . Professor D : I see . Right . What 's { disfmarker } what 's that ? Grad C : Um , { vocalsound } I 'm trying to um { disfmarker } So there was a paper in ICSLP about um this { disfmarker } this multi - band um , belief - net structure . { comment } This guy did { disfmarker } Professor D : Mm - hmm . Grad C : uh basically it was two H M Ms with { disfmarker } with a { disfmarker } with a dependency arrow between the two H M Professor D : Uh - huh . Grad C : And so I wan na try { disfmarker } try coupling them instead of t having an arrow that { disfmarker } that flows from one sub - band to another sub - band . I wan na try having the arrows go both ways . And um , { vocalsound } I 'm just gon na see if { disfmarker } if that { disfmarker } that better models { pause } um , uh asynchrony in any way or um { disfmarker } { pause } Yeah . Professor D : Oh ! OK . Well , that sounds interesting . Grad C : Yeah . Professor D : OK . Alright . Anything to { disfmarker } { vocalsound } you wanted to { disfmarker } No . OK . Silent partner in the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } in the meeting . Oh , we got a laugh out of him , that 's good . OK , everyone h must contribute to the { disfmarker } our { disfmarker } our sound { disfmarker } { vocalsound } sound files here . OK , so speaking of which , if we do n't have anything else that we need { disfmarker } You happy with where we are ? PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : Know { disfmarker } know wher know where we 're going ? Uh { disfmarker } PhD A : I think so , yeah . Professor D : Yeah , yeah . You { disfmarker } you happy ? PhD B :  Professor D : You 're happy . OK everyone { pause } should be happy . OK . You do n't have to be happy . You 're almost done . Yeah , yeah . OK . Grad E : Al - actually I should mention { disfmarker } So if { disfmarker } { comment } um , about the Linux machine `` Swede . `` Professor D : Yeah . Grad E : So it looks like the um , neural net tools are installed there . PhD A : Mmm . Grad E : And um Dan Ellis { comment } I believe knows something about using that machine so PhD A : Mmm . Grad E : If people are interested in { disfmarker } in getting jobs running on that maybe I could help with that . PhD A : Yeah , but I do n't know if we really need now a lot of machines . Well . we could start computing another huge table but { disfmarker } yeah , we { disfmarker } Professor D : Well . Yeah , I think we want a different table , at least PhD A : Yeah , sure . Professor D : Right ? I mean there 's { disfmarker } there 's some different things that we 're trying to get at now . PhD A : But { disfmarker } Professor D : But { disfmarker } PhD A : Yeah . Mmm . Professor D : So . Yeah , as far as you can tell , you 're actually OK on C - on CPU uh , for training and so on ? Yeah . PhD A : Ah yeah . I think so . Well , more is always better , but mmm , I do n't think we have to train a lot of networks , now that we know { disfmarker } We just select what works { pause } fine Professor D : OK . OK . PhD A : and try to improve this PhD B : Yeah . to work Professor D : And we 're OK on { disfmarker } And we 're OK on disk ? PhD A : and { disfmarker } It 's OK , yeah . Well sometimes we have some problems . PhD B : Some problems with the { disfmarker } Professor D : But they 're correctable , uh problems . PhD A : Yeah , restarting the script basically PhD B : You know . PhD A : and { disfmarker } Professor D : Yes . Yeah , I 'm familiar with { vocalsound } that one , OK . Alright , so uh , { comment } { vocalsound } since uh , we did n't ha get a channel on for you , { comment } you do n't have to read any digits but the rest of us will . Uh , is it on ? Well . We did n't uh { disfmarker } I think I wo n't touch anything cuz I 'm afraid of making the driver crash which it seems to do , { pause } pretty easily . OK , thanks . OK , so we 'll uh { disfmarker } I 'll start off the uh um connect the { disfmarker } PhD A : My battery is low . Professor D : Well , let 's hope it works . Maybe you should go first and see so that you 're { disfmarker } OK . PhD B : batteries ? Grad C : Yeah , your battery 's going down too . Professor D : Transcript uh two { disfmarker } Grad C : Carmen 's battery is d going down too . Professor D : Oh , OK . Yeah . Why do n't you go next then . OK . Guess we 're done . OK , uh so . Just finished digits . Yeah , so . Uh Well , it 's good . I think { disfmarker } I guess we can turn off our microphones now . Grad C : Just pull the batteries out . 
Query : What did the professor think about MSG ? PhD A : or focus more on the targets and on the training data and { disfmarker } ? Professor D : Yeah , I think for right now um , I th I { disfmarker } I really liked MSG . And I think that , you know , one of the things I liked about it is has such different temporal properties . And um , I think that there is ultimately a really good uh , potential for , you know , bringing in things with different temporal properties . Um , but um , uh , we only have limited time and there 's a lot of other things we have to look at . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : And it seems like much more core questions are issues about the training set and the training targets , and fitting in uh what we 're doing with what they 're doing , and , you know , with limited time . Yeah . I think { pause } we have to start cutting down . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : So uh { disfmarker } I think so , yeah . And then , you know , once we { disfmarker } Um , having gone through this { pause } process and trying many different things , I would imagine that certain things uh , come up that you are curious about uh , that you 'd not getting to and so when the dust settles from the evaluation uh , I think that would time to go back and take whatever intrigued you most , you know , got you most interested uh and uh { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and work with it , you know , for the next round . Uh , as you can tell from these numbers uh , nothing that any of us is gon na do is actually gon na completely solve the problem . PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : So . So , { comment } there 'll still be plenty to do . Barry , you 've been pretty quiet . Grad C : Just listening . 
Query : What did the team think about their progress ? Professor D : OK . Alright . Anything to { disfmarker } { vocalsound } you wanted to { disfmarker } No . OK . Silent partner in the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } in the meeting . Oh , we got a laugh out of him , that 's good . OK , everyone h must contribute to the { disfmarker } our { disfmarker } our sound { disfmarker } { vocalsound } sound files here . OK , so speaking of which , if we do n't have anything else that we need { disfmarker } You happy with where we are ? PhD A : Mmm . Professor D : Know { disfmarker } know wher know where we 're going ? Uh { disfmarker } PhD A : I think so , yeah . Professor D : Yeah , yeah . You { disfmarker } you happy ? PhD B :  Professor D : You 're happy . OK everyone { pause } should be happy . OK . You do n't have to be happy . You 're almost done . Yeah , yeah . OK . Grad E : Al - actually I should mention { disfmarker } So if { disfmarker } { comment } um , about the Linux machine `` Swede . `` Professor D : Yeah . Grad E : So it looks like the um , neural net tools are installed there . PhD A : Mmm . 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Project Manager : So welcome . The first kick-off meeting . What shall we do ? First the opening , then the rest . What are we going to do . We m have to make a new remote control . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : It has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . So we will get back th on that . First we have to make a functional design . After that we have to make a conceptual design , and then after that a detailed design . So we 'll discuss that later . First we have a look at { gap } . So first to { disfmarker } we have to make a small painting . What have { disfmarker } do we have to do . First you can save the documents . We have to do that every time we make something . You can print it . No . And we have to use { vocalsound } the pen and the eraser . So { disfmarker } Now . We all have to use this one . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : You have to make your own favourite animal . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So I 'll make an example . Marketing : Yep . Project Manager : First do n't touch that things . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } You can use the pen . And then you can make { vocalsound } um something . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Nice . Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um you can change some things . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Um format , line , and change it . { gap } { disfmarker } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } And you can change the colour . User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : An elephant . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } So that 's it . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So { disfmarker } So and after it you have to save it . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Now we can make a new one . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : You have to paint now . { vocalsound } So you 're next . Marketing : Oh . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : 'Kay . Marketing : Well we will try . Where it going ? Industrial Designer : { gap } . User Interface : Hmm . That 's uh strange . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { gap } . Project Manager : What is going on ? Industrial Designer : { gap } pop-ups . Project Manager : What are you { disfmarker } What ? Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { gap } . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : What is this , Pictionary . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Um { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh a bird . Project Manager : Is a { disfmarker } It is a { disfmarker } It is a { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Bird . Project Manager : A duck . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : So { disfmarker } Now save ? Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Hmm . Marketing : Now uh blank ? Project Manager : Blank , yes . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Okay next one . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay . Let 's try this . Uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Whoo . Marketing : Yeah , yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Um . Mm-hmm . Mm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Oh . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Oh not . Oh . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Okay . Okay . Yeah . No problem . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Shit happens . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } I 'm not getting anything uh on my screen now . Okay . Industrial Designer : A parrot . Ish . Marketing : Wow . Oh . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : He did it before . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : No , no . Yeah . Okay . Marketing : { vocalsound } Nice . Project Manager : Very good . Industrial Designer : Oh . User Interface : Uh blank . Industrial Designer : Thank you . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . Very good . So um you can always go back . { gap } So { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 's it . So that was two . Now next . The budget . The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it . So { vocalsound } now we have to think about what we will make . First I wan na hear from you . Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh I will start . Project Manager : F first { gap } . Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } { gap } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . So that wo n't be uh our goal , I think . User Interface : No . Industrial Designer : And uh g big buttons , { vocalsound } m uh that 's easier to use than uh { disfmarker } I think . Not all the small buttons , you do n't know { disfmarker } Project Manager : Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ? Industrial Designer : Big buttons , positive . Project Manager : Positive . Industrial Designer : All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you wo n't know what they 're working for . Project Manager : Okay . What are your experiences ? User Interface : Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it 's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : And that it controls the channels and the the volume . And uh I I I think it 's positive if there 's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it { disfmarker } in it . And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it 's working . And uh yeah . Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : So and do they always have that ? User Interface : Yeah , but { disfmarker } No no no . But I { disfmarker } my my experience is that it it it 's convenient to have that . Project Manager : It 's easy to you . User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager : Okay . 'Kay . Marketing : Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Thank you . Marketing : That 's not really ea easy . Industrial Designer : Help also . { vocalsound } Thank you . Marketing : So it would be nice if we have one for all . And we also had a remote control for our radio set . But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you did n't know which one was what . And it was uh uh v { vocalsound } not easy to use . So we n barely used it . Project Manager : Okay so they have too much . So next . User Interface : Hmm . Project Manager : For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : The weight . Not not too heavy . Project Manager : Not too heavy . Yes . Industrial Designer : Not much buttons . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Bust-free . That when you drop it , it wo n't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic . Uh buttons not too small . Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you ca n't find it . Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some { gap } { disfmarker } uh some sort of bleep . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Like a phone . Industrial Designer : And then you uh , hey there there 's remote control . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So , Industrial Designer : Next . Project Manager : that 's { gap } . User Interface : Yeah well that 's { disfmarker } that are good ideas . Uh { disfmarker } Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it 's working . If you push a button . Um { disfmarker } Yeah . And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah I think it uh { disfmarker } from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you wo n't sell it . Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them . Project Manager : Okay . This is { disfmarker } It has to be compatible with other things . Marketing : Yes . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : I have one more idea . Just popped up . Project Manager : Yes ? Industrial Designer : Uh it it wo n't take a lot of batteries . So you do n't { disfmarker } wo n't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks . Project Manager : No battery use . So more ideas ? User Interface : Mm no . Project Manager : No okay . It 's only the first ideas . So { vocalsound } uh what are we going to do now is { disfmarker } Next meeting is in half an h hour . Uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Okay . Next meeting , half an hour . Um , what you have to do . Well look on your { gap } . And { disfmarker } Next instructions you 'll get in your email . So { disfmarker } This is the first meeting . See you later in half an hour . User Interface : Yes . Industrial Designer : Okay . Thank you . Marketing : Okay .

Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Project Manager : Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . { vocalsound } Uh y getting close to the last Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : is the penultim meeting . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : How was lunch ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Mm great . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Thanks { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : Do n't be sarcastic . { vocalsound } Mark . { vocalsound } Project Manager : So { vocalsound } um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy . Marketing : Uh Rama . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Ramaro . Project Manager : Um um we have to take a decision on the control { disfmarker } remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : So what we want to { disfmarker } the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um { vocalsound } a trend watching on what he 's { disfmarker } he 's been doing . It 's { disfmarker } So , let 's go . First with Rama . Participant two . Industrial Designer : Yeah , participant two . Component . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yep . So we 're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we 'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use { vocalsound } traditional solar cells or { disfmarker } mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ Marketing : Ah . Industrial Designer : and then uh titanium , which can be { disfmarker } which have very good look an and then interface we 're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some { gap } , moving { gap } kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to { disfmarker } we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and { disfmarker } which can use microphone { gap } sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we 're to { disfmarker } in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . Project Manager : Mm-hmm , okay . Industrial Designer : So uh we discussed an { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or { disfmarker } and well the problem is with this design we found that we ca n't use double-curved shapes . Marketing : What is a double-curved shape ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Like you can have two curves . Marketing : Uh-huh . User Interface : Why ? Industrial Designer : Uh it 's { disfmarker } I think in manufacturing I guess it 's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it 's really lesser { disfmarker } uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it 's more expensive , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : we want to reduce uh cost . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . Marketing : The cost . Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } Uh { disfmarker } And also like in { disfmarker } if you put a { gap } it 's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things Project Manager : Okay . You m titanium it 's more uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : and { disfmarker } Yeah . User Interface : W we can use something like you know { vocalsound } the whole body 's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Mm like this ? Project Manager : Yes so mm { disfmarker } User Interface : to make it feel better and to you know { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Like in cell phones recently Project Manager : Uh-huh . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : these { disfmarker } you can { gap } with the rubber in four directions and { disfmarker } Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Okay . { gap } Industrial Designer : yeah . But full assembly { disfmarker } We 'll use mainly for titanium { gap } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : rubber is expensive Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : and also it 's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : And this push buttons Project Manager : Uh yeah so Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we 're { gap } we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money Project Manager : Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated . Industrial Designer : for { disfmarker } S S Marketing : Speech { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Okay , and still we have { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so { disfmarker } User Interface : mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? Marketing : L_C_D_ . User Interface : L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : Uh l Marketing : Seems not , it 's either L_C_D_ or push-button . Industrial Designer : So uh User Interface : No , Industrial Designer : it 's like a { disfmarker } User Interface : it 's not gon na be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus . Marketing : Ah . Industrial Designer : Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we 'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay , so let 's try it , let 's t Industrial Designer : because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or { gap } or something so we want to reduce the cost on display Marketing : { gap } The L_C_D_ would { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : or this inter Marketing : The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . User Interface : Yeah , yeah , it 's it 's not gon na be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information . Marketing : Just uh for output , yeah . Industrial Designer : Ok Yeah , that can we we can consider , Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : because like it wo n't take much money I guess , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : because { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Okay , yep . Project Manager : { gap } Mm . Industrial Designer : You have any further questions or ? Marketing : I guess no um . So the batteries uh are going to be very light . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , we 're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries Marketing : Okay . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : for really light batteries and with uh good price . Marketing : So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be { disfmarker } ask . Industrial Designer : Yeah , that 's { disfmarker } then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it { disfmarker } m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . If we 're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology Project Manager : Okay , Industrial Designer : and so { disfmarker } Project Manager : for the location . Hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , if if everybody in the house n { gap } to locate then we 're to go for some speaker independent technology or something . Marketing : Okay . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . So let 's now go to the { disfmarker } you do n't have more question ? Industrial Designer : { gap } Marketing : No , it 's okay . Project Manager : Um mm thank you mm . User Interface : No more questions . Industrial Designer : Yep . Thank you . Marketing : Puts less of constraint on what we can do Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Mm yeah , yeah . Marketing : but Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : it 's always like that . We have dreams and the { disfmarker } in the end we find out that it 's not feasible . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah , but { disfmarker } mm . Industrial Designer : Oh . We have uh some limitations { gap } . { vocalsound } Marketing : Anyway . { vocalsound } Yeah . User Interface : But still uh L_S_D_ 's already quite nice , Marketing : L_C_D_ . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . { vocalsound } User Interface : L_C_ { vocalsound } Marketing : L_S_D_ is something else , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : and it 's quite nice as well . { vocalsound } User Interface : I 'm an artist , sorry . { vocalsound } Marketing : So , Project Manager : Um { vocalsound } yeah . User Interface : So uh , that 's not { disfmarker } Marketing : go on uh artist . { vocalsound } User Interface : I hope that 's not too much . Project Manager : Now let 's talk about uh interface . User Interface : Okay . { vocalsound } Uh participant number three . Project Manager : Three . Industrial Designer : Three . User Interface : { vocalsound } Uh Project Manager : Which one ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Hmm . { vocalsound } User Interface : mm mm uh have a look at this { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : no it 's { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . User Interface : { gap } Uh so the concept of the interface . Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user 's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . So let 's start with this . We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } User Interface : and uh we got explanation for every button Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button , I do n't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm I I do n't remember Project Manager : { vocalsound } Mm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? Or no { gap } ? I can see nothing . So that 's our concept . It 's called the millennium remote control . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Let 's change millenniums . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } So User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : maybe you can use { gap } in the end and { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : { gap } does n't make sense . This is very { vocalsound } ugly . User Interface : Really ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : I thought you like it . Ah okay Marketing : Oh no , User Interface : just press the button , please uh . { vocalsound } Marketing : too much concept . Project Manager : No . Marketing : Ah . Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah , we will not use this . We will not use this . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : But instead of this I will devise { disfmarker } That 's our concept . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Ah , back today . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : And it 's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . 'Kay . User Interface : And uh what will people say ? They 'll say it 's perfect . Or what will say ? Uh they will say it 's splendid . And uh e everyone will say I 'll buy it . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : { gap } Do you think it can come in several colours ? User Interface : And everyone 's gon na be satisfied . Marketing : Or did the { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours . Marketing : Um but not the case . User Interface : Not the case . Marketing : Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff , User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : like { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , well they like uh something which is uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay , so let 's remember there 's a Nokia phone which changeable panels . Marketing : Mm yeah , okay , User Interface : Do you like it ? Marketing : so that would be the option . I do n't know I do n't have a Nokia phone , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } But it 's uh { disfmarker } Marketing : but I do n't use that but again , uh I might { disfmarker } User Interface : That 's why you do n't have it . That 's why , Marketing : Yeah , User Interface : 'cause it 's nasty . { vocalsound } Marketing : bu but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ . User Interface : No . Industrial Designer : Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Maybe we can just { disfmarker } if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly . User Interface : Um , I am here . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : So users have different { disfmarker } I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so { disfmarker } Project Manager : So ? User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : So we can just { disfmarker } if they want they can just pay another two Euro . Project Manager : Uh-huh , okay , so User Interface : 'Kay . Project Manager : you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we { disfmarker } if you want o more colours { vocalsound } on L_C_D_ , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah yeah yes . If they want like uh { disfmarker } so that we can { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : Kind of upgradable uh { vocalsound } remote control . Project Manager : yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : Wow , wow . Industrial Designer : Just they 'll get few more things and few more colours . User Interface : Okay , what uh { disfmarker } there 's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um { vocalsound } 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , Industrial Designer : Lights , yeah . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : And thermodynamic also . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Like a chameleon . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah . User Interface : We can make it in fact . Project Manager : Yeah but that 's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah . User Interface : If if if the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : okay . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : But uh it can be in uh maybe in an { disfmarker } a gradable version , User Interface : Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , Project Manager : but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : so { disfmarker } Marketing : Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I 'm going to talk about this later but { disfmarker } and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it 's like a signature . My remote control is pink . Nobody else than me has a pink remote control . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } And that makes me special . Project Manager : Okay Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : and you think that we do n't have to make to make them pay more because of { vocalsound } uh o or this is { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . Project Manager : Okay , so Marketing : Those who wanted to have it pink . Project Manager : so { vocalsound } i it 's not uh a s base service Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : No mm no . Project Manager : it 's a { disfmarker } User Interface : So , Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : { gap } be an option , Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : yeah . Marketing : It might be optional , yeah . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : But those people will be really few , no ? So like we can { gap } those { disfmarker } Marketing : The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . Industrial Designer : Ah . Marketing : Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : So m so Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } Project Manager : maybe that 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } if that it 's a selling point maybe it has to be the base . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah , yeah , Marketing : Mm . Yeah . User Interface : yeah . But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time . Project Manager : { vocalsound } And you 'll be different . User Interface : { vocalsound } And it makes you different , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , yeah . User Interface : you know ? Marketing : You always have your remote . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Uh in the train uh , hello uh no . { vocalsound } Want to change my neighbour . User Interface : Anyone has their remote controls here ? Marketing : Oh , you do n't ? { vocalsound } Yeah . You do n't have your remo { vocalsound } User Interface : No ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . It 's a kind of remote control . { vocalsound } Uh it 's white User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : and it 's so white that you see it from any anywhere . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : It has this distinctive look and feel and look { gap } which people seems to like { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay . Marketing : just because it 's { vocalsound } a colour that we do n't usually see in a remote control . White . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Uh-huh , uh-huh . Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ? Marketing : Seems important . Industrial Designer : Hmm . User Interface : That they can use it in darkness , like . Hand light , Marketing : Mm { gap } glow in the dark , Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah Marketing : so { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so that like { disfmarker } at least um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Iradium ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay . Okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { gap } { vocalsound } Yeah , Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Ah sorry . Mm . Industrial Designer : that { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . So mm { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay . S well , Marketing : Okay . User Interface : let 's go on maybe with the presentation . Marketing : Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah sure . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } User Interface : And um the remote control 's going to be smart Industrial Designer : Oh . User Interface : but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : And uh Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : I dunno Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : that 's a question to you and to mm to { disfmarker } Marketing : Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that 's the smartness of the thing . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Currently we do n't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : but we may have remote controls with speech recognition . User Interface : Okay , okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : I dunno . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm , that 's a nice world . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } So just just just just think about it um . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { gap } Thank you . Marketing : Do n't touch the remote . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : But { disfmarker } yeah . Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father does n't want . User Interface : Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart . Marketing : Like with some { disfmarker } Maybe fingerprint recognition or { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Voice recognition is quite tough . I say do n't use it , and the control just looks . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Mm . User Interface : 'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it . Marketing : Um { disfmarker } Mm . Industrial Designer : Uh that { disfmarker } mm that could be feasible I guess , like { disfmarker } So since we have { disfmarker } we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use { disfmarker } Marketing : Okay . So it could be smart in that way . Industrial Designer : yeah . Yeah , yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm . Okay . Marketing : But for instance th I I 'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you 're more often uh { disfmarker } things like that Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : Yeah , sure . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : I dunno , that might be expensive Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : but Industrial Designer : Uh it 's { disfmarker } Marketing : that might also be a good sales pitch again . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } The remote that knows you . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Okay , thanks . Project Manager : { vocalsound } So it 's { disfmarker } Marketing : My turn ? Project Manager : yeah , Marketing Expert . Marketing : { gap } Okay , it 's alright . Project Manager : Participant two ? Industrial Designer : Four . Project Manager : Four , Marketing : Four , I think . Project Manager : sorry . Marketing : Trend , yeah . No uh yes . Okay , so I 'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So , next slide please . So first maybe just a small recap on { vocalsound } how how do we watch trends so it 's not so uh simple you might think that it 's easy but uh it 's not so simple . Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people { gap } have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh { vocalsound } example of where to in be inspired . Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also { disfmarker } have also to be inspired because in fact they 're not only watching the trends , they 're inventing it , they 're creating the trend . I hope I 'm going to try to help you on that . This is more risky because you 're not following the trend , Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you do n't and you 're out of business . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : So anyway uh next slide please . { vocalsound } Uh to be to be quick { vocalsound } there 's a lot of words here but uh basically there are { disfmarker } uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very { disfmarker } pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . Strangely enough it 's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that 's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , Industrial Designer : { gap } Marketing : it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh { vocalsound } it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it 's not so important that it 's useful as a remote control . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Next slide please . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it 's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so { disfmarker } currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of { vocalsound } of look or feel Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { gap } { vocalsound } Marketing : or so . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : And I think of course uh { vocalsound } i it applies to everything . That 's the thing with trends . { vocalsound } It it can travel f from clothe to furniture { vocalsound } same idea . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . { vocalsound } And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : What is spongy ? Marketing : yeah . Well Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah Marketing : this { vocalsound } so so I think uh uh i Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } kind of um maybe { disfmarker } { gap } Marketing : When we were talking about rubber , Industrial Designer : Yeah it { disfmarker } Marketing : I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it 's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : S So maybe titanium it 's not a good idea . Industrial Designer : Yeah . { gap } We need to think about { disfmarker } mm mm . Marketing : Seems not , seems not . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um { vocalsound } sorry Mark . Marketing : So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : It seems to be { disfmarker } Marketing : Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , Industrial Designer : Fruit . Even shape ? Marketing : as a { disfmarker } even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } More { gap } Project Manager : Mm-mm . Industrial Designer : yeah . Yeah . Marketing : And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Mm . Project Manager : Hmm . { vocalsound } You 're old-fashioned . Marketing : So that 's what people seem to { disfmarker } { vocalsound } yeah i I know it 's quite far from what you thought Project Manager : Sorry . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : but that 's that 's fashion and { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : Okay that 's all I have to say . Project Manager : Mm you have questions ? Industrial Designer : So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? Or it 's { disfmarker } Marketing : These { disfmarker } I 'm sorry . Industrial Designer : This { disfmarker } you you { gap } so did you { gap } { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , Industrial Designer : Where ? Oh . Oh , okay , mm-hmm . Marketing : as you know our company is quite big and uh so I 'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends Industrial Designer : It 's not from { disfmarker } mm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : that are also { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : It 's more general trend Marketing : well . Industrial Designer : it 's not particular to the remote control . Marketing : No , it 's not it 's not { disfmarker } this this is very general , yeah . But it seems that trends travel across things . Industrial Designer : Mm . Yeah . Marketing : The { disfmarker } what we { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah but some materials n they 're to be uh they 're to be something like solid like they ca n't be really spongy Marketing : Sure . Industrial Designer : or { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : yeah yeah . Marketing : We have to { disfmarker } I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables Industrial Designer : yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that 's { disfmarker } Marketing : but we still have to put our chips inside , so { disfmarker } { vocalsound } of course . Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah Marketing : This is your problem . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : that { disfmarker } yeah yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } This is not mine . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , looking { disfmarker } yeah fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . We can have t colours or this shape Marketing : Yeah , I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material . Industrial Designer : or at least { disfmarker } Marketing : If if it 's something like rubber made or { disfmarker } I think it it 's also going to be good . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Okay ? Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } No more question ? Okay . Marketing : Yep . Thanks . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . Okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design , Industrial Designer : Look and feel de Project Manager : um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . { vocalsound } Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Hmm . Mm sounds interesting . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm um and I { disfmarker } { vocalsound } as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction . Marketing : Okay . User Interface : Okay . Marketing : Thanks . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : So , can we highlight the specific features of our { gap } { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah you 're right , you have to { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , Project Manager : So Industrial Designer : that 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : you say s Industrial Designer : we want to follow general trend . Marketing : Spongy . Project Manager : S Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : do we agree on that ? Yeah . We have to . Industrial Designer : So , do you think { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } No , we do n't have to , User Interface : So we have to uh for { disfmarker } Project Manager : No . { vocalsound } Marketing : but seems it 's the trend . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Yeah . Marketing : Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . User Interface : yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : So there 's no { disfmarker } Well , that 's { disfmarker } you t can try to convince us . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Well , we can make it smell like fruit . { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay . { vocalsound } { gap } that 's a good idea , Project Manager : Okay , { vocalsound } that 's a good idea . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } That 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : So titanium smell like fruit . Marketing : I { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : So what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? Or they really like { disfmarker } They more want these fancy features Marketing : Uh { disfmarker } I think i Industrial Designer : like { disfmarker } Marketing : yeah i it 's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it 's a good sell for us Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Feature { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : because we have it Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : and others do n't . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : It 's fancy . Whether it 's useful or not does n't seem to be very important . { vocalsound } Project Manager : I I agree with uh this uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager : Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options Project Manager : Mm . Yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : and { disfmarker } Marketing : Maybe you could explore the two option . Industrial Designer : yeah yeah . User Interface : Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean { gap } fruit-shaped . Project Manager : { gap } Industrial Designer : Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Do n't you say that you can not do double shape { disfmarker } uh curved shape { disfmarker } User Interface : But { disfmarker } Doub double-curved . Industrial Designer : yeah it 's it 's Marketing : Mm . Seems to be { gap } . Project Manager : yeah . Industrial Designer : yeah that 's a { disfmarker } we 're to look for { gap } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Okay . Industrial Designer : and and s we 're to see the { disfmarker } whether rubber is expensive User Interface : Okay , okay . In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the { disfmarker } like titanium panels on a whole rubber body . Industrial Designer : and d Hmm . Project Manager : Mm-mm . Okay , so User Interface : Well , okay w we 'll see . Project Manager : you explore now that you 're going to work together these these two . User Interface : Yeah Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Or or spongy an yeah . { gap } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Maybe we can have two different { gap } assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : { gap } we have only the plastic or the { disfmarker } the chippy { disfmarker } yeah fibre chips or { disfmarker } User Interface : We 'll see . We 'll see . Marketing : If you have time . Project Manager : Mm . Yeah I do n't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy Industrial Designer : Uh . Project Manager : but uh it can not be both . User Interface : We 'll see . I I really do n't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some { gap } for for Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } For creation . User Interface : I dunno uh { disfmarker } yeah um Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : we 'll look . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Ah you can pretend that it 's uh titanium . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Even design . { vocalsound } Marketing : You can paint it afterward { gap } . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay , okay . Marketing : No problem . We have a very large department of { vocalsound } paint . Project Manager : Yeah , do do n't worry , you you { vocalsound } you speak with { disfmarker } mm mm . Marketing : { vocalsound } You will do it . { vocalsound } User Interface : Alright , alright . Project Manager : Okay . So explore a shape . Industrial Designer : So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm I think it 's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information . Industrial Designer : { gap } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Not uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Okay . Marketing : The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says { disfmarker } if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are . Industrial Designer : Yeah , then we can { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : yeah , yeah , that { disfmarker } user friendly Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : or { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : That 's the converse to having zillions of button Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : where each button does only one thing . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : and we just stick with two batteries so it 's not any solar or { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : yeah yeah j yeah , Marketing : Classical , we stay classical in that we do n't reinvent uh the wheel . Industrial Designer : because { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : Mm . { vocalsound } Marketing : Anyway it 's very { disfmarker } in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } So . { vocalsound } Because the trend goes faster than the life of the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : So it 's { gap } very { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . So Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : are we { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , we 're done . Marketing : We 're done . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . So see you in thirty minutes . Industrial Designer : Yep . 
Query : Summarize the discussion about industrial components . Industrial Designer : Yep . So we 're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we 'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use { vocalsound } traditional solar cells or { disfmarker } mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ Marketing : Ah . Industrial Designer : and then uh titanium , which can be { disfmarker } which have very good look an and then interface we 're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some { gap } , moving { gap } kind of thing . So , as we discussed before , we need to { disfmarker } we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and { disfmarker } which can use microphone { gap } sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we 're to { disfmarker } in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . Project Manager : Mm-hmm , okay . Industrial Designer : So uh we discussed an { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or { disfmarker } and well the problem is with this design we found that we ca n't use double-curved shapes . Marketing : What is a double-curved shape ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Like you can have two curves . Marketing : Uh-huh . User Interface : Why ? Industrial Designer : Uh it 's { disfmarker } I think in manufacturing I guess it 's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it 's really lesser { disfmarker } uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it 's more expensive , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : we want to reduce uh cost . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . Marketing : The cost . Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } Uh { disfmarker } And also like in { disfmarker } if you put a { gap } it 's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things Project Manager : Okay . You m titanium it 's more uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : and { disfmarker } Yeah . User Interface : W we can use something like you know { vocalsound } the whole body 's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Mm like this ? Project Manager : Yes so mm { disfmarker } User Interface : to make it feel better and to you know { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Like in cell phones recently Project Manager : Uh-huh . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : these { disfmarker } you can { gap } with the rubber in four directions and { disfmarker } Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Okay . { gap } Industrial Designer : yeah . But full assembly { disfmarker } We 'll use mainly for titanium { gap } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : rubber is expensive Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : and also it 's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : And this push buttons Project Manager : Uh yeah so Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we 're { gap } we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money Project Manager : Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated . Industrial Designer : for { disfmarker } S S Marketing : Speech { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Okay , and still we have { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so { disfmarker } User Interface : mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? Marketing : L_C_D_ . User Interface : L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : Uh l Marketing : Seems not , it 's either L_C_D_ or push-button . Industrial Designer : So uh User Interface : No , Industrial Designer : it 's like a { disfmarker } User Interface : it 's not gon na be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus . Marketing : Ah . Industrial Designer : Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we 'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay , so let 's try it , let 's t Industrial Designer : because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or { gap } or something so we want to reduce the cost on display Marketing : { gap } The L_C_D_ would { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : or this inter Marketing : The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . User Interface : Yeah , yeah , it 's it 's not gon na be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information . Marketing : Just uh for output , yeah . Industrial Designer : Ok Yeah , that can we we can consider , Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : because like it wo n't take much money I guess , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : because { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Okay , yep . Project Manager : { gap } Mm . Industrial Designer : You have any further questions or ? Marketing : I guess no um . So the batteries uh are going to be very light . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , we 're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries Marketing : Okay . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : for really light batteries and with uh good price . Marketing : So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be { disfmarker } ask . Industrial Designer : Yeah , that 's { disfmarker } then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it { disfmarker } m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . If we 're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology Project Manager : Okay , Industrial Designer : and so { disfmarker } Project Manager : for the location . Hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , if if everybody in the house n { gap } to locate then we 're to go for some speaker independent technology or something . Marketing : Okay . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . So let 's now go to the { disfmarker } you do n't have more question ? Industrial Designer : { gap } Marketing : No , it 's okay . Project Manager : Um mm thank you mm . User Interface : No more questions . Industrial Designer : Yep . Thank you . Marketing : Puts less of constraint on what we can do Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Mm yeah , yeah . Marketing : but Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : it 's always like that . We have dreams and the { disfmarker } in the end we find out that it 's not feasible . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah , but { disfmarker } mm . Industrial Designer : Oh . We have uh some limitations { gap } . { vocalsound } Marketing : Anyway . { vocalsound } Yeah . User Interface : But still uh L_S_D_ 's already quite nice , Marketing : L_C_D_ . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . { vocalsound } User Interface : L_C_ { vocalsound } Marketing : L_S_D_ is something else , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : and it 's quite nice as well . { vocalsound } User Interface : I 'm an artist , sorry . { vocalsound } Marketing : So , Project Manager : Um { vocalsound } yeah . User Interface : So uh , that 's not { disfmarker } Marketing : go on uh artist . { vocalsound } User Interface : I hope that 's not too much . 
Query : What did the industrial designer recommend when discussing industrial components and why ? Industrial Designer : So uh we discussed an { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Excuse me . So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or { disfmarker } and well the problem is with this design we found that we ca n't use double-curved shapes . Marketing : What is a double-curved shape ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Like you can have two curves . Marketing : Uh-huh . User Interface : Why ? Industrial Designer : Uh it 's { disfmarker } I think in manufacturing I guess it 's problematic . So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it 's really lesser { disfmarker } uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it 's more expensive , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : we want to reduce uh cost . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . Marketing : The cost . Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } Uh { disfmarker } And also like in { disfmarker } if you put a { gap } it 's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things Project Manager : Okay . You m titanium it 's more uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : and { disfmarker } Yeah . User Interface : W we can use something like you know { vocalsound } the whole body 's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Mm like this ? Project Manager : Yes so mm { disfmarker } User Interface : to make it feel better and to you know { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Like in cell phones recently Project Manager : Uh-huh . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : these { disfmarker } you can { gap } with the rubber in four directions and { disfmarker } Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Okay . { gap } Industrial Designer : yeah . But full assembly { disfmarker } We 'll use mainly for titanium { gap } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : rubber is expensive Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : and also it 's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : And this push buttons Project Manager : Uh yeah so Industrial Designer : { disfmarker } we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we 're { gap } we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money Project Manager : Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated . Industrial Designer : for { disfmarker } S S Marketing : Speech { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Okay , and still we have { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : so { disfmarker } 
Query : What did the user interface designer propose in the discussion about industrial components ? User Interface : mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? Marketing : L_C_D_ . User Interface : L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : Uh l Marketing : Seems not , it 's either L_C_D_ or push-button . Industrial Designer : So uh User Interface : No , Industrial Designer : it 's like a { disfmarker } User Interface : it 's not gon na be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus . Marketing : Ah . Industrial Designer : Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we 'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay , so let 's try it , let 's t Industrial Designer : because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or { gap } or something so we want to reduce the cost on display Marketing : { gap } The L_C_D_ would { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : or this inter Marketing : The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . User Interface : Yeah , yeah , it 's it 's not gon na be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information . Marketing : Just uh for output , yeah . Industrial Designer : Ok Yeah , that can we we can consider , Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : because like it wo n't take much money I guess , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : because { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Okay , yep . Project Manager : { gap } Mm . 
Query : Summarize the discussion about user interface concept . Project Manager : Now let 's talk about uh interface . User Interface : Okay . { vocalsound } Uh participant number three . Project Manager : Three . Industrial Designer : Three . User Interface : { vocalsound } Uh Project Manager : Which one ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Hmm . { vocalsound } User Interface : mm mm uh have a look at this { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : no it 's { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . User Interface : { gap } Uh so the concept of the interface . Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user 's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . So let 's start with this . We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } User Interface : and uh we got explanation for every button Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and uh go back button , I do n't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm I I do n't remember Project Manager : { vocalsound } Mm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? Or no { gap } ? I can see nothing . So that 's our concept . It 's called the millennium remote control . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Let 's change millenniums . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } So User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : maybe you can use { gap } in the end and { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : { gap } does n't make sense . This is very { vocalsound } ugly . User Interface : Really ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : I thought you like it . Ah okay Marketing : Oh no , User Interface : just press the button , please uh . { vocalsound } Marketing : too much concept . Project Manager : No . Marketing : Ah . Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah , we will not use this . We will not use this . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : But instead of this I will devise { disfmarker } That 's our concept . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Ah , back today . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : And it 's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . 'Kay . User Interface : And uh what will people say ? They 'll say it 's perfect . Or what will say ? Uh they will say it 's splendid . And uh e everyone will say I 'll buy it . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : { gap } Do you think it can come in several colours ? User Interface : And everyone 's gon na be satisfied . Marketing : Or did the { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours . Marketing : Um but not the case . User Interface : Not the case . Marketing : Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff , User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : like { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , well they like uh something which is uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay , so let 's remember there 's a Nokia phone which changeable panels . Marketing : Mm yeah , okay , User Interface : Do you like it ? Marketing : so that would be the option . I do n't know I do n't have a Nokia phone , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } But it 's uh { disfmarker } Marketing : but I do n't use that but again , uh I might { disfmarker } User Interface : That 's why you do n't have it . That 's why , Marketing : Yeah , User Interface : 'cause it 's nasty . { vocalsound } Marketing : bu but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ . User Interface : No . Industrial Designer : Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Maybe we can just { disfmarker } if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this uh the shapes and they can have different assembly . User Interface : Um , I am here . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : So users have different { disfmarker } I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so { disfmarker } Project Manager : So ? User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : So we can just { disfmarker } if they want they can just pay another two Euro . Project Manager : Uh-huh , okay , so User Interface : 'Kay . Project Manager : you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we { disfmarker } if you want o more colours { vocalsound } on L_C_D_ , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah yeah yes . If they want like uh { disfmarker } so that we can { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : Kind of upgradable uh { vocalsound } remote control . Project Manager : yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : Wow , wow . Industrial Designer : Just they 'll get few more things and few more colours . User Interface : Okay , what uh { disfmarker } there 's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um { vocalsound } 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , Industrial Designer : Lights , yeah . Marketing : Mm . Project Manager : And thermodynamic also . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Like a chameleon . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah . User Interface : We can make it in fact . Project Manager : Yeah but that 's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah . User Interface : If if if the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : okay . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : But uh it can be in uh maybe in an { disfmarker } a gradable version , User Interface : Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , Project Manager : but { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : so { disfmarker } Marketing : Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I 'm going to talk about this later but { disfmarker } and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it 's like a signature . My remote control is pink . Nobody else than me has a pink remote control . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } And that makes me special . Project Manager : Okay Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : and you think that we do n't have to make to make them pay more because of { vocalsound } uh o or this is { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . Project Manager : Okay , so Marketing : Those who wanted to have it pink . Project Manager : so { vocalsound } i it 's not uh a s base service Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : No mm no . Project Manager : it 's a { disfmarker } User Interface : So , Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : { gap } be an option , Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : yeah . Marketing : It might be optional , yeah . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : But those people will be really few , no ? So like we can { gap } those { disfmarker } Marketing : The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . Industrial Designer : Ah . Marketing : Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : So m so Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } Project Manager : maybe that 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } if that it 's a selling point maybe it has to be the base . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah , yeah , Marketing : Mm . Yeah . User Interface : yeah . But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time . Project Manager : { vocalsound } And you 'll be different . User Interface : { vocalsound } And it makes you different , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , yeah . User Interface : you know ? Marketing : You always have your remote . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Uh in the train uh , hello uh no . { vocalsound } Want to change my neighbour . User Interface : Anyone has their remote controls here ? Marketing : Oh , you do n't ? { vocalsound } Yeah . You do n't have your remo { vocalsound } User Interface : No ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . It 's a kind of remote control . { vocalsound } Uh it 's white User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : and it 's so white that you see it from any anywhere . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : It has this distinctive look and feel and look { gap } which people seems to like { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay . Marketing : just because it 's { vocalsound } a colour that we do n't usually see in a remote control . White . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Uh-huh , uh-huh . Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ? Marketing : Seems important . Industrial Designer : Hmm . User Interface : That they can use it in darkness , like . Hand light , Marketing : Mm { gap } glow in the dark , Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah Marketing : so { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so that like { disfmarker } at least um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Iradium ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay . Okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { gap } { vocalsound } Yeah , Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Ah sorry . Mm . Industrial Designer : that { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . So mm { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay . S well , Marketing : Okay . User Interface : let 's go on maybe with the presentation . Marketing : Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah sure . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } User Interface : And um the remote control 's going to be smart Industrial Designer : Oh . User Interface : but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : And uh Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : I dunno Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : that 's a question to you and to mm to { disfmarker } Marketing : Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that 's the smartness of the thing . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Currently we do n't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : but we may have remote controls with speech recognition . User Interface : Okay , okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : I dunno . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm , that 's a nice world . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } So just just just just think about it um . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : { gap } Thank you . Marketing : Do n't touch the remote . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : But { disfmarker } yeah . Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father does n't want . User Interface : Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart . Marketing : Like with some { disfmarker } Maybe fingerprint recognition or { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Voice recognition is quite tough . I say do n't use it , and the control just looks . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Mm . User Interface : 'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it . Marketing : Um { disfmarker } Mm . Industrial Designer : Uh that { disfmarker } mm that could be feasible I guess , like { disfmarker } So since we have { disfmarker } we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use { disfmarker } Marketing : Okay . So it could be smart in that way . Industrial Designer : yeah . Yeah , yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm . Okay . Marketing : But for instance th I I 'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you 're more often uh { disfmarker } things like that Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : Yeah , sure . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : I dunno , that might be expensive Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : but Industrial Designer : Uh it 's { disfmarker } Marketing : that might also be a good sales pitch again . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } The remote that knows you . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Okay , thanks . 
Query : Why did the marketing propose having different colours for the product ? Marketing : Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . Those for which the remote control is uh is to be uh something useful uh I 'm going to talk about this later but { disfmarker } and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it 's like a signature . My remote control is pink . Nobody else than me has a pink remote control . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . User Interface : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } And that makes me special . Project Manager : Okay Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : and you think that we do n't have to make to make them pay more because of { vocalsound } uh o or this is { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . Project Manager : Okay , so Marketing : Those who wanted to have it pink . Project Manager : so { vocalsound } i it 's not uh a s base service Industrial Designer : Uh { disfmarker } Marketing : No mm no . Project Manager : it 's a { disfmarker } User Interface : So , Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : { gap } be an option , Project Manager : Mm . User Interface : yeah . Marketing : It might be optional , yeah . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : But those people will be really few , no ? So like we can { gap } those { disfmarker } Marketing : The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . Industrial Designer : Ah . Marketing : Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : So m so Industrial Designer : Mm . { vocalsound } Project Manager : maybe that 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } if that it 's a selling point maybe it has to be the base . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah , yeah , Marketing : Mm . Yeah . 
Query : Summarize the marketing expert 's opinions towards user identification . Marketing : But { disfmarker } yeah . Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father does n't want . User Interface : Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart .

Query : Summarize the discussion about trend watching and appearance design . Project Manager : { vocalsound } So it 's { disfmarker } Marketing : My turn ? Project Manager : yeah , Marketing Expert . Marketing : { gap } Okay , it 's alright . Project Manager : Participant two ? Industrial Designer : Four . Project Manager : Four , Marketing : Four , I think . Project Manager : sorry . Marketing : Trend , yeah . No uh yes . Okay , so I 'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So , next slide please . So first maybe just a small recap on { vocalsound } how how do we watch trends so it 's not so uh simple you might think that it 's easy but uh it 's not so simple . Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people { gap } have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh { vocalsound } example of where to in be inspired . Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also { disfmarker } have also to be inspired because in fact they 're not only watching the trends , they 're inventing it , they 're creating the trend . I hope I 'm going to try to help you on that . This is more risky because you 're not following the trend , Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you do n't and you 're out of business . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : So anyway uh next slide please . { vocalsound } Uh to be to be quick { vocalsound } there 's a lot of words here but uh basically there are { disfmarker } uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very { disfmarker } pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . Strangely enough it 's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that 's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , Industrial Designer : { gap } Marketing : it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh { vocalsound } it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it 's not so important that it 's useful as a remote control . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Next slide please . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it 's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so { disfmarker } currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of { vocalsound } of look or feel Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { gap } { vocalsound } Marketing : or so . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : And I think of course uh { vocalsound } i it applies to everything . That 's the thing with trends . { vocalsound } It it can travel f from clothe to furniture { vocalsound } same idea . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . { vocalsound } And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : What is spongy ? Marketing : yeah . Well Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah Marketing : this { vocalsound } so so I think uh uh i Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } kind of um maybe { disfmarker } { gap } Marketing : When we were talking about rubber , Industrial Designer : Yeah it { disfmarker } Marketing : I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it 's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : S So maybe titanium it 's not a good idea . Industrial Designer : Yeah . { gap } We need to think about { disfmarker } mm mm . Marketing : Seems not , seems not . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um { vocalsound } sorry Mark . Marketing : So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : It seems to be { disfmarker } Marketing : Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , Industrial Designer : Fruit . Even shape ? Marketing : as a { disfmarker } even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } More { gap } Project Manager : Mm-mm . Industrial Designer : yeah . Yeah . Marketing : And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Mm . Project Manager : Hmm . { vocalsound } You 're old-fashioned . Marketing : So that 's what people seem to { disfmarker } { vocalsound } yeah i I know it 's quite far from what you thought Project Manager : Sorry . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : but that 's that 's fashion and { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : Okay that 's all I have to say . Project Manager : Mm you have questions ? Industrial Designer : So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? Or it 's { disfmarker } Marketing : These { disfmarker } I 'm sorry . Industrial Designer : This { disfmarker } you you { gap } so did you { gap } { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , Industrial Designer : Where ? Oh . Oh , okay , mm-hmm . Marketing : as you know our company is quite big and uh so I 'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends Industrial Designer : It 's not from { disfmarker } mm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : that are also { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : It 's more general trend Marketing : well . Industrial Designer : it 's not particular to the remote control . Marketing : No , it 's not it 's not { disfmarker } this this is very general , yeah . But it seems that trends travel across things . Industrial Designer : Mm . Yeah . Marketing : The { disfmarker } what we { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah but some materials n they 're to be uh they 're to be something like solid like they ca n't be really spongy Marketing : Sure . Industrial Designer : or { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : yeah yeah . Marketing : We have to { disfmarker } I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables Industrial Designer : yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that 's { disfmarker } Marketing : but we still have to put our chips inside , so { disfmarker } { vocalsound } of course . Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah Marketing : This is your problem . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : that { disfmarker } yeah yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } This is not mine . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , looking { disfmarker } yeah fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . We can have t colours or this shape Marketing : Yeah , I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material . Industrial Designer : or at least { disfmarker } Marketing : If if it 's something like rubber made or { disfmarker } I think it it 's also going to be good . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Okay ? Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } No more question ? Okay . Marketing : Yep . Thanks . Industrial Designer : yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , Project Manager : So Industrial Designer : that 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : you say s Industrial Designer : we want to follow general trend . Marketing : Spongy . Project Manager : S Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : do we agree on that ? Yeah . We have to . Industrial Designer : So , do you think { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } No , we do n't have to , User Interface : So we have to uh for { disfmarker } Project Manager : No . { vocalsound } Marketing : but seems it 's the trend . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Yeah . Marketing : Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . User Interface : yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : So there 's no { disfmarker } Well , that 's { disfmarker } you t can try to convince us . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Well , we can make it smell like fruit . { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay . { vocalsound } { gap } that 's a good idea , Project Manager : Okay , { vocalsound } that 's a good idea . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } That 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : So titanium smell like fruit . Marketing : I { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : So what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? Or they really like { disfmarker } They more want these fancy features Marketing : Uh { disfmarker } I think i Industrial Designer : like { disfmarker } Marketing : yeah i it 's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it 's a good sell for us Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Feature { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : because we have it Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : and others do n't . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : It 's fancy . Whether it 's useful or not does n't seem to be very important . { vocalsound } Project Manager : I I agree with uh this uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager : Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy uh fruity-like Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Uh we will try to explore these two options Project Manager : Mm . Yeah , yeah . Industrial Designer : and { disfmarker } Marketing : Maybe you could explore the two option . Industrial Designer : yeah yeah . User Interface : Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean { gap } fruit-shaped . Project Manager : { gap } Industrial Designer : Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Do n't you say that you can not do double shape { disfmarker } uh curved shape { disfmarker } User Interface : But { disfmarker } Doub double-curved . Industrial Designer : yeah it 's it 's Marketing : Mm . Seems to be { gap } . Project Manager : yeah . Industrial Designer : yeah that 's a { disfmarker } we 're to look for { gap } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Okay . Industrial Designer : and and s we 're to see the { disfmarker } whether rubber is expensive User Interface : Okay , okay . In fact I just agreed to make uh to make the { disfmarker } like titanium panels on a whole rubber body . Industrial Designer : and d Hmm . Project Manager : Mm-mm . Okay , so User Interface : Well , okay w we 'll see . Project Manager : you explore now that you 're going to work together these these two . User Interface : Yeah Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Or or spongy an yeah . { gap } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Maybe we can have two different { gap } assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : { gap } we have only the plastic or the { disfmarker } the chippy { disfmarker } yeah fibre chips or { disfmarker } User Interface : We 'll see . We 'll see . Marketing : If you have time . Project Manager : Mm . Yeah I do n't think w I think we have to choose . If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy Industrial Designer : Uh . Project Manager : but uh it can not be both . User Interface : We 'll see . I I really do n't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some { gap } for for Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } For creation . User Interface : I dunno uh { disfmarker } yeah um Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : we 'll look . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Ah you can pretend that it 's uh titanium . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Even design . { vocalsound } Marketing : You can paint it afterward { gap } . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay , okay . Marketing : No problem . We have a very large department of { vocalsound } paint . Project Manager : Yeah , do do n't worry , you you { vocalsound } you speak with { disfmarker } mm mm . Marketing : { vocalsound } You will do it . { vocalsound } User Interface : Alright , alright . Project Manager : Okay . So explore a shape . 
Query : What did the marketing learn about the trend ? Marketing : Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it 's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so { disfmarker } currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of { vocalsound } of look or feel Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { gap } { vocalsound } Marketing : or so . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : And I think of course uh { vocalsound } i it applies to everything . That 's the thing with trends . { vocalsound } It it can travel f from clothe to furniture { vocalsound } same idea . Marketing : Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , Industrial Designer : Fruit . Even shape ? Marketing : as a { disfmarker } even in the shape it has to be more round and uh more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } More { gap } Project Manager : Mm-mm . Industrial Designer : yeah . Yeah . Marketing : And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Mm . Project Manager : Hmm . { vocalsound } You 're old-fashioned . Marketing : So that 's what people seem to { disfmarker } { vocalsound } yeah i I know it 's quite far from what you thought Project Manager : Sorry . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : but that 's that 's fashion and { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : Okay that 's all I have to say . Project Manager : Mm you have questions ? Industrial Designer : So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? Or it 's { disfmarker } Marketing : These { disfmarker } I 'm sorry . Industrial Designer : This { disfmarker } you you { gap } so did you { gap } { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , Industrial Designer : Where ? Oh . Oh , okay , mm-hmm . Marketing : as you know our company is quite big and uh so I 'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends Industrial Designer : It 's not from { disfmarker } mm . Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : that are also { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : It 's more general trend Marketing : well . Industrial Designer : it 's not particular to the remote control . Marketing : No , it 's not it 's not { disfmarker } this this is very general , yeah . But it seems that trends travel across things . 
Query : Summarize the discussion about appearance design . Industrial Designer : yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , Project Manager : So Industrial Designer : that 's { disfmarker } Project Manager : you say s Industrial Designer : we want to follow general trend . Marketing : Spongy . Project Manager : S Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : do we agree on that ? Yeah . We have to .

Project Manager : Okay . So explore a shape . 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting Grad E : I guess . Grad A : OK , we 're on . So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless . Grad E : Check one . Check one . Grad A : And you should be able to see which one { disfmarker } which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change . Grad B : So , which is my bar ? Mah ! Number one . Grad A : Yep . Grad E : Sibilance . Sibilance . Grad A : So , actually , if you guys wan na go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright . Grad E : Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ? Grad A : No . No . Grad E : Oh , OK . Grad A : Each individually . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . { vocalsound } To try to read them while everyone else is . Grad E : Everyone would need extreme focus . Grad A : So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on . Professor C : Other way . We m We may wind up with ver We { disfmarker } we may need versions of all this garbage . Grad B : For our stuff . Yeah . Professor C : Yeah . Grad A : Um . So the first thing you 'd wan na do is just say which transcript you 're on . Professor C : Yeah . Grad A : So . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give { disfmarker } I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about { pause } stuff before everyone 's here . Professor C : Mmm . Well , we have one more coming . Grad A : OK . Well , why do n't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there . Professor C : OK . Well , we can start doing it . Grad A : Thanks . So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you do n't breathe into the mike . Um . Yeah , that 's good . And uh { disfmarker } So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . And the short form { disfmarker } I mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you do n't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you do n't like . Um . On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . If you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . So , do n't worry too much about it . The { disfmarker } It 's just self rating . Um . And I think that 's about it . I mean , should I { disfmarker } Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ? Professor C : Um , yeah . Grad A : or { disfmarker } ? Professor C : No . There was { disfmarker } there was { disfmarker } Let 's see . Oh { disfmarker } Grad E : Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ? Grad B : I sent an email . Professor C : She got an emai she was notified . Grad E : Oh yeah , she got an e Yeah , yeah . Professor C : Whether she knows { vocalsound } is another question . Um . So are the people going to be identified by name ? Grad A : Well , what we 're gon na { disfmarker } we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . Um , but not in the audio . Professor C : Right . Grad A : So the Professor C : OK . So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . Since it { disfmarker } it does is n't attributed . Oh , I see , but the a but the { disfmarker } but the { disfmarker } Grad A : Right , so if I said , `` Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? `` , we 're not gon na go through and cancel out the `` Jerry `` s . Professor C : Yeah . Sure . Grad A : Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight . Professor C : Right . Grad A : Um , but uh , Professor C : Right . Grad A : um , it w uh , I do n't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data . Professor C : OK . Mm - hmm . No , I { disfmarker } I was n't complaining , Grad A : Yep . Professor C : I just wanted to understand . Grad A : Right . Professor C : OK . Grad B : Well , we can make up aliases for each of us . Grad A : Yeah , I mean , whatever you wan na do is fine , Professor C : Right . Grad F : OK . Grad A : but we find that { disfmarker } We want the meeting to be as natural as possible . So , we 're trying to do real meetings . Professor C : OK . Grad A : And so we do n't wan na have to do aliases Professor C : Right . Grad A : and we do n't want people to be editing what they say . Grad B : Right . Grad A : So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft . Professor C : Right . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad A : You know ? Professor C : Right . Um , OK . So why do n't you tell us briefly Grad A : OK . So th Professor C : your { disfmarker } give { disfmarker } give your e normal schpiel . Grad A : Um . So this is { disfmarker } The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um . { comment } The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record it , and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . So that 's my particular interest , is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings . Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings . Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , as well as the close talking mikes . What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , gives us , um , high quality audio , um , especially for people who are n't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . So , for people who are more interested in language , we did n't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available . And then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition . Um . And so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results . So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two . So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time . And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that . Our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the LDC . And , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus . Um . { vocalsound } There 's other work going on in meeting recording . So , we 're { disfmarker } we 're working with SRI , with UW , Um . NIST has started an effort which will include video . We 're not including video , obviously . And uh { disfmarker } and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from IBM . Is also involved . Um . Oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task . Um . So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to { disfmarker } to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier . And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits , which is a common connected digits corpus . So we 'll have some , um , comparison to be able to be made . Professor C : OK . Grad A : Anything else ? Professor C : No . Grad A : OK , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless . It should be on already . Um . Either one of those . And uh , read the digit strings and { disfmarker } and fill out the forms . So , the most important form is the consent form , so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent . Grad B : I 'm sure it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late , Grad A : Yeah . Grad B : so you will have to leave what you set . Grad A : Right . And uh , just give me a call , which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over . Professor C : Yep . Grad A : And { disfmarker } I 'm going to leave the mike here but it 's n { nonvocalsound } Uh , but I 'm not gon na be on so do n't have them use this one . It 'll just be sitting here . Grad B : Input ? Yeah . There we go . Professor C : By the way , Adam , we will be using the , uh , screen as well . Grad B : Yep . Professor C : So , you know . Wow ! Organization . So you guys who got email about this { pause } oh f uh , Friday or something about what we 're up to . Grad E : No . Grad F : No . Grad B : I got it . Grad E : What was the nature of the email ? Professor C : Oh , this was about { pause } um , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words , like `` s go to see `` , or `` visit `` , or some Grad B : Wel - we I { disfmarker } uh { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } Professor C : You did n't get it ? Grad E : I do n't think I did . Professor C : I guess these g have got better filters . Cuz I sent it to everybody . You just blew it off . Grad E : Ah . Professor C : OK . Grad B : It 's really simple though . So this is the idea . Um . We could pursue , um , if we thought it 's { disfmarker } it 's worth it but , uh , I think we { disfmarker } we will agree on that , um , to come up with a { disfmarker } with a sort of very , very first crude prototype , and do some implementation work , and do some { disfmarker } some research , and some modeling . So the idea is if you want to go somewhere , um , and focus on that object down { disfmarker } Oh , I can actually walk with this . This is nice . down here . That 's the Powder - Tower . Now , um , { vocalsound } we found in our , uh , data and from experiments , that there 's three things you can do . Um , you can walk this way , and come really , really close to it . And touch it . But you can not enter or do anything else . Unless you 're interested in rock climbing , it wo n't do you no good standing there . It 's just a dark alley . But you can touch it . If you want to actually go up or into the tower , you have to go this way , and then through some buildings and up some stairs and so forth . If you actually want to see the tower , and that 's what actually most people want to do , is just have a good look of it , take a picture for the family , { comment } you have to go this way , and go up here . And there you have a vre really view { disfmarker } It exploded , the { disfmarker } during the Thirty years - war . Really uh , interesting sight . And um , these uh { disfmarker } these lines are , um , paths , Grad E : Mmm . Grad B : or so That 's ab er , i the street network of our geographic information system . And you can tell that we deliberately cut out this part . Because otherwise we could n't get our GIS system to take { disfmarker } to lead people this way . It would always use the closest point to the object , and then the tourists would be faced , you know , in front of a wall , but it would do them absolutely no good . So , { vocalsound } what we found interesting is , first of all , intentions differ . Maybe you want to enter a building . Maybe you want to see it , take a picture of it . Or maybe you actually want to come as close as possible to the building . For whatever reason that may be . Grad E : What 's it { disfmarker } what 's it made out of ? Grad B : Um , r red limestone . Grad E : So maybe you would wan na touch it . Grad B : Yeah , maybe you would want to touch it . Um . Okay , I { disfmarker } This , um { disfmarker } These intentions , we { disfmarker } w w we could , if we want to , call it the { disfmarker } the Vista mode , where we just want to { disfmarker } eh { disfmarker } s get the overview or look at it , the Enter mode , and the , well , Tango mode . I always come up with { disfmarker } with silly names . So this `` Tango `` means , literally translated , `` to touch `` . So { disfmarker } But sometimes the { disfmarker } the Tango mode is really relevant in the { disfmarker } in the sense that , um , if you want to , uh { disfmarker } If you do n't have the intention of entering your building , but you know that something is really close to it , and you just want to approach it , or get to that building . Consider , for example , the Post Office in Chicago , a building so large that it has its own zip code . So the entrance could be miles away from the closest point . So sometimes it m m m makes sense maybe to d to distinguish there . So , um , I 've looked , uh , through twenty some { disfmarker } Uh , I did n't look through all the data . um , and there { disfmarker } there 's uh , a lot more different ways in people { disfmarker } uh , the ways people phrase how to g get { disfmarker } if they want to get to a certain place . And sometimes here it 's b it 's a little bit more obvious { disfmarker } Um . { vocalsound } Maybe I should go back a couple of steps and go through the { disfmarker } Professor C : No , OK come in , sit down . If you grab yourself a microphone . Grad B : You need to sign some stuff and read some digits . Professor C : Well , you can sign afterwards . Grad B : O or later . Grad E : You have to al also have to read some digits . Professor C : Afterwards . Grad D : OK . { comment } OK . Afterwards is fine . Grad B : They are uncomfortable . Mm - hmm . Grad D : Really small ? OK . I see . OK . Grad B : Yep . Grad D : Thank you . Grad B : OK , but that was our idea . Professor C : And it { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } it it also has to be switched on , Nance . Grad B : Is { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I think { disfmarker } Grad E : No , that one 's already on , I thought he said . Professor C : It 's on ? OK , good . Grad D : OK . It 's on . Grad E : Yeah . Grad B : OK . That was the idea . Um , people , when they w when they want to go to a building , sometimes they just want to look at it . Sometimes they want to enter it . And sometimes they want to get really close to it . That 's something we found . It 's just a truism . And the places where you will lead them for these intentions are sometimes ex in incredibly different . I { disfmarker } I gave an example where the point where you end up if you want to look at it is completely different from where { disfmarker } if you want to enter it . So , this is sort of how people may , uh { disfmarker } may phrase those requests to a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a mock - up system at least that 's the way they did it . And we get tons of { disfmarker } of these `` how do I get to `` , `` I want to go to `` , but also , `` give me directions to `` , and `` I would like to see `` . And um , what we can sort of do , if we look closer a closer at the { disfmarker } the data { disfmarker } That was the wrong one . um , we can look at some factors that may make a difference . First of all , very important , and um , that { disfmarker } I 've completely forgot that when we talked . This is of course a crucial factor , `` what type of object is it ? `` So , some buildings you just do n't want to take pictures of . Or very rarely . But you usually want to enter them . Some objects are more picturesque , and you { disfmarker } more f more highly photographed . Then of course the { disfmarker } the actual phrases may give us some idea of what the person wants . Um . Sometimes I found in the { disfmarker } Uh , looking at the data , in a superficial way , I found some s sort of modifiers that { disfmarker } that m may also give us a hint , um , `` I 'm trying to get to `` Nuh ? `` I need to get to `` . Sort of hints to the fact that you 're not really sightseeing and { disfmarker } and just f there for pleasure and so forth and so on . And this leads us straight to the context which also should be considered . That whatever it is you 're doing at the moment may also inter influence the interpretation of { disfmarker } of a phrase . So , this is , uh , really uh , uh , uh { disfmarker } My suggestion is really simple . We start with , um { disfmarker } Now , Let me , uh , say one more thing . What we do know , is that the parser we use in the SmartKom system will never differentiate between any of these . So , basically all of these things will result in the same XML M - three - L structure . Sort of action `` go `` , and then an object . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : Yeah ? and a source . So it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } it 's way too crude to d capture those differences in intentions . So , I thought , `` Mmm ! Maybe for a deep understanding task , that 's a nice sort of playground or first little thing . `` Where we can start it and n sort of look { disfmarker } `` OK , we need , we gon na get those M - three - L structures . The crude , undifferentiated parse . Interpreted input . We may need additional part of speech , or maybe just some information on the verb , and modifiers , auxiliaries . We 'll see . And I will try to { disfmarker } to sort of come up with a list of factors that we need to get out of there , and maybe we want to get a g switch for the context . So this is not something which we can actually monitor , { vocalsound } now , but just is something we can set . And then you can all imagine sort of a { disfmarker } a constrained satisfaction program , depending on { disfmarker } on what , um , comes out . We want to have an { disfmarker } a structure resulting if we feed it through a belief - net or { disfmarker } or something along those lines . We 'd get an inferred intention , we { disfmarker } we produce a structure that differentiates between the Vista , the Enter , and the , um , Tango mode . Which I think we maybe want to ignore . But . That 's my idea . It 's up for discussion . We can change all of it , any bit of it . Throw it all away . Grad F : Now @ @ this email that you sent , actually . Professor C : What ? Grad F : Now I remember the email . Professor C : OK . Grad E : Huh . Still , I have no recollection whatsoever of the email . I 'll have to go back and check . Professor C : Not important . So , what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is . And , the { disfmarker } the i uh , Robert and I talked about this some on Friday . And we think it 's well - formed . So we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain . Grad F : So , where exactly is the , uh , deeper understanding being done ? Like I mean , s is it before the Bayes - net ? Is it , uh { disfmarker } Professor C : Well , it 's the { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } it 's always all of it . So , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is , everywhere . Uh , so the notion is that , uh , this is n't real deep . But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing . And , so that 's { disfmarker } that 's the quote `` deep `` that we 're trying to get at . And , Robert 's point is that the current front - end does n't give you any way to { disfmarker } Not only does n't it do it , but it also does n't give you enough information to do it . It is n't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you , and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on . So , uh , and this is { disfmarker } Bu - I in general it 's gon na be true of any kind of deep understanding , there 's gon na be contextual things , there 're gon na be linguistic things , there 're gon na be discourse things , and they got ta be combined . And , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net , although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gon na work better . Um , the idea would be that { vocalsound } you , uh , take your { disfmarker } You 're editing your slide ? Grad B : Yeah . As i a sort of , as I get ideas , uh w uh . Professor C : Oh . Grad B : So , discourse { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I thought about that . Of course that needs to sort of go in there . Professor C : Oh . I 'm sorry . OK . So . This is minutes { disfmarker } taking minutes as we go , in his { disfmarker } in his own way . Grad B : Yep . Professor C : Um , but the p the { disfmarker } Anyway . So the thing is , { vocalsound } i uh , d naively speaking , you 've { disfmarker } you 've got a { disfmarker } for this little task , a belief - net , which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things , that the person wants to { disfmarker } uh , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it . Um . So that { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed . And , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things . And , then the question is { disfmarker } there are two questions { disfmarker } is , uh , one , where do you get this i { comment } information from , and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ? So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ? And you probably need intermediate nodes . I { disfmarker } we do n't know what they are yet . So it may well be that , uh , for example , that , uh , knowing whether { disfmarker } Oh , another thing you want is some information abou I think , about the time of day . Now , they may wan na call that part of context . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : But the time of day matters a lot . And , if things are obviously closed , then , you { disfmarker } Grad B : People wo n't want to enter it . Professor C : Pe - people do n't wan na enter them . And , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually uh , point out to people that it 's closed { disfmarker } you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they do n't have the option of entering it . Grad B : s b Professor C : So another thing that can come up , and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is , that another option of course is to have a { disfmarker } more of a dialogue . So if someone says something you could ask them . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : OK . And { disfmarker } Now , one thing you could do is always ask them , but that 's boring . And it also w it also be a pain for the person using it . So one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , `` whenever you got a question like that I 've got one of three answers . Ask them which one you want . `` OK . But that 's , um , not what we 're gon na do . Grad B : But maybe that 's a false state of the system , that it 's too close to call . Professor C : Oh yeah . You want the { disfmarker } you want the ability to a You want the ability to ask , but what you do n't wan na do is onl build a system that always asks every time , and i That 's not getting at the scientific problem , Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : and it 's { disfmarker } In general you 're { disfmarker } you know , it 's gon na be much more complex than that . a This is purposely a really simple case . Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : So , uh { disfmarker } Yeah . Grad B : I have one more point to { disfmarker } to Bhaskara 's question . Um , I think also the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the deep understanding part of it is { disfmarker } is going to be in there to the extent that we um , want it in terms of our modeling . We can start , you know , basic from human beings , model that , its motions , going , walking , seeing , we can mem model all of that and then compose whatever inferences o we make out of these really conceptual primitives . That will be extremely deep in the { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } in { disfmarker } in my understanding . Professor C : Yeah . S so { disfmarker } so the way that might come up , if you wan na { disfmarker } Suppose you wanted to do that , you might say , `` Um , as an intermediate step in your belief - net , is there a Source - Path - Goal schema involved ? `` OK ? And if so , uh , is there a focus on the goal ? Or is there a focus on the path ? or something . And that could be , uh , one of the conditiona you know , th the { disfmarker } In some piece of the belief - net , that could be the { disfmarker } the appropriate thing to enter . Grad F : So , where would we extract that information from ? From the M - three - L ? Professor C : No . No . See , the M - three - L is not gon na give th What he was saying is , the M - three - L does not have any of that . All it has is some really crude stuff saying , `` A person wants to go to a place . `` Grad F : Right . Grad E : The M - three - L is the old SmartKom output ? Professor C : Right . M - three well , M - three - L itself refers to Multimedia Mark - up Language . Grad E : OK . It 's just a language . Right , yeah . Professor C : So we have th w we we we have to have a better w way of referring to { disfmarker } Grad B : The parser output ? Professor C : Mm - hmm . Grad B : `` Analyzed speech `` I think it 's what they call it , Professor C : Yeah . The { disfmarker } Well , OK . Grad B : really , oder { disfmarker } Professor C : Yeah . Grad B : o th No , actually , intention lattices is what we 're gon na get . Professor C : Is - i but they c they call it intention lattice , but tha Grad B : In - in a intention lattice k Hypothesis . Professor C : Anyway . Grad B : They call it intention hypotheses . Professor C : Right . So , th they 're gon na give us some cr uh { disfmarker } or { disfmarker } We can assume that y you get this crude information . About intention , and that 's all they 're going to provide . And they do n't give you the kind of object , they do n't give you any discourse history , if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else . Grad B : Well , they keep it . We have to request it . Professor C : Right . Grad B : Nuh ? But it 's not in there . Professor C : Well , they { disfmarker } they kee they keep it by their lights . Grad B : Hmm . Professor C : It may { disfmarker } it may or may not be what { disfmarker } what we want . Grad B : Yeah , or i Professor C : Yeah . Grad E : So , if someone says , `` I wan na touch the side of the Powder - Tower `` , that would { disfmarker } basically , we need to pop up Tango mode and the { disfmarker } and the directions ? Professor C : If i if { disfmarker } Yeah , if it got as simple as that , yeah . Grad E : Yeah . Professor C : But it would n't . Grad E : OK . But that does n't necessarily { disfmarker } But we 'd have to infer a Source - Path - Goal to some degree for touching the side , right ? Grad B : Well { disfmarker } Uh , th the there is a p a point there if I understand you . Correct ? Um , because um , sometimes people just say things { disfmarker } This you find very often . `` Where is the city hall ? `` And this do they do n't wan na sh see it on a map , or they do n't wan na know it 's five hundred yards away from you , or that it 's to the { disfmarker } your north . They wan na go there . That 's what they say , is , `` Where is it ? `` . Where is that damn thing ? Grad E : And the parser would output { disfmarker } Grad B : Well , that 's a { disfmarker } a question mark . sh A lot of parsers , um , just , uh { disfmarker } That 's way beyond their scope , is { disfmarker } of interpreting that . You know ? But um , still outcome w the outcome will be some form of structure , with the town hall and maybe saying it 's a WH focus on the town hall . But to interpret it , Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : you know ? somebody else has to do that job later . Professor C : Yeah . Grad E : I 'm just trying to figure out what the SmartKom system would output , depending on these things . Grad B : Um , it will probably tell you how far away it is , at least that 's { disfmarker } That 's even what Deep Map does . It tells you how far away it is , and { disfmarker } and shows it to you on a map . Because i we can not differentiate , at the moment , between , you know , the intention of wanting to go there or the intention of just know wanting to know where { disfmarker } where it is . Grad D : People no might not be able to infer that either , right ? Like the fact { disfmarker } Like , I could imagine if someone came up to me and asked , `` Where 's the city hall ? `` , I might say , g ar `` Are you trying to get there ? `` Because how I describe um , t its location { disfmarker } uh , p probably depend on whether I think I should give them , you know , directions now , or say , you know , whatever , `` It 's half a mile away `` or something like that . Grad B : Mm - hmm . It 's a granularity factor , Professor C : Yeah . Grad B : because where people ask you , `` Where is New York ? `` , you will tell them it 's on the East Coast . Grad D : Uh - huh . Yeah . Exactly . Right . Right . Grad B : Y y eh { disfmarker } you wo n't tell them how to get there , ft you know , take that bus to the airport and blah - blah - blah . Grad D : Yeah . Grad B : But if it 's the post office , you will tell them how to get there . Grad D : Right . Mm - hmm . Grad B : So th They have done some interesting experiments on that in Hamburg as well . Grad D : Right . Grad B : So . Grad D : Right . Professor C : But { disfmarker } i Go { disfmarker } go back to the { disfmarker } the uh , th Grad B : So I w this is { disfmarker } `` onto `` is { disfmarker } is knowledge about buildings , Professor C : Yeah , that slide . Grad B : their opening times , and then t coupled with time of day , um , this should { disfmarker } You know . Grad D : So that context was like , um , their presumed purpose context , i like business or travel , as well as the utterance context , like , `` I 'm now standing at this place at this time `` . Professor C : Yeah , well I think we ought to d a As we have all along , d We { disfmarker } we 've been distu distinguishing between situational context , which is what you have as context , and discourse context , Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : which you have as DH , Grad B : Nuh . Professor C : I do n't know what the H means . Grad B : History . Discourse history . Yeah . Professor C : OK . Whatever . So we can work out terminology later . Grad B : Yep . Professor C : So , they 're { disfmarker } they 're quite distinct . I mean , you need them both , but they 're quite distinct . And , so what we were talking about doing , a a as a first shot , is not doing any of the linguistics . Except to find out what seems to be { pause } useful . So , the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the reason the belief - net is in blue , is the notion would be { disfmarker } Uh , this may be a bad dis bad idea , but the idea is to take as a first goal , see if we could actually build a belief - net that would make this three way distinction uh , in a plausible way , given these { disfmarker } We have all these transcripts and we 're able to , by hand , extract the features to put in the belief - net . Saying , `` Aha ! here 're the things which , if you get them out of { disfmarker } out of the language and discourse , and put them into the belief - net , it would tell you which of these three uh , intentions is most likely . `` And if { disfmarker } to actually do that , build it , um { disfmarker } you know , run it { disfmarker } y y run it on the data where you hand - transcribe the parameters . And see how that goes . If that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them . So { disfmarker } where would you get this information ? And , expand it to { disfmarker } to other things like this . But if we ca n't do that , then we 're in trouble . I mean th th i i if you ca n't do this task , um { disfmarker } Grad B : We need a different , uh , engine . Machine , I mean . Professor C : Uh , uh , yeah , or something . Well it { disfmarker } i I if it { disfmarker } if it 's the belief - nets , we we 'll switch to you know , logic or some terrible thing , but I do n't think that 's gon na be the case . I think that , uh , if we can get the information , a belief - net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it . The real issue is , do what are the factors involved in determining this ? And I do n't know . Grad B : Hmm . But , only w Professor C : Hold on a s Hold on a second . Grad B : Muh . Professor C : So , I know . Uh , uh , is it clear what 's going on here ? Grad F : Yep . Grad D : Um , I missed the beginning , but , um I guess { disfmarker } could you back to the slide , the previous one ? So , is it that it 's , um { disfmarker } These are all factors that uh , a These are the ones that you said that we are going to ignore now ? or that we want to { vocalsound } take into account ? You were saying n Professor C : Take them into account . But { disfmarker } but you do n't worry about { disfmarker } h Grad D : Take the { disfmarker } the linguistic factors too . Oh , how to extract these features . Professor C : how to extract them . So , f let 's find out which ones we need first , Grad D : OK . Got it . Professor C : and { disfmarker } Grad D : OK . And { disfmarker } and it 's clear from the data , um , like , sorta the correct answer in each case . Professor C : No . Grad D : But l Grad B : No . But { disfmarker } Grad D : OK . Professor C : Let 's go back to th Let 's go back to the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the slide of data . Grad D : That 's { disfmarker } that 's the thing I 'm curious ab Grad B : Um { disfmarker } Grad D : Like do we know from the data wh which { disfmarker } OK . So { disfmarker } Grad B : Not from that data . But , um , since we are designing a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } an , compared to this , even bigger data collection effort , { comment } um , we will definitely take care to put it in there , Grad D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Grad B : in some shape , way , form over the other , Grad D : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Yeah . Grad B : to see whether we can , then , get sort of empirically validated data . Grad D : Right . Grad B : Um , from this , we can sometimes , you know { disfmarker } an and that 's { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } but that { disfmarker } is n't that what we need for a belief - net anyhow ? is sort of { disfmarker } s sometimes when people want to just see it , they phrase it more like this ? But it does n't exclude anybody from phrasing it totally differently , even if they still { disfmarker } Grad D : Mm - hmm . Right . Grad B : you know ? Grad D : Right . Grad B : But then other factors may come into play that change the outcome of their belief - net . So , um , this is exactly what { disfmarker } Grad D : Right . Grad B : Because y you can never be sure . And I 'm sure even i the most , sort of , deliberate data collection experiment will never give you data that say , `` Well , if it 's phrased like that , the intention is this . `` Grad D : Sure . Grad B : You know , because then , uh , you { disfmarker } Grad D : u u I mean , the only way you could get that is if you were to give th the x subjects a task . Right ? Where you have { disfmarker } where your , uh , current goal is to { disfmarker } Grad B : We Yeah ! That 's what we 're doing . Grad D :  Grad B : But { disfmarker } but we will still get the phrasing all over the place . Grad D : So that 's what you want ? OK . So you will know . Grad B : I 'm sure that , you know { disfmarker } Professor C : Yeah . Grad D : Mm - hmm . The { disfmarker } No , that 's fine . I guess , it 's just knowing the intention from the experimental subject . Professor C : Yeah . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : From that task , yeah . So , uh , I think you all know this , but we are going to actually use this little room Grad D :  Professor C : and start recording subjects probably within a month or something . So , this is not any { disfmarker } lo any of you guys ' worry , except that we may want to push that effort to get information we need . So our job { vocalsound } is to figure out how to solve these problems . If it turns out that we need data of a certain sort , then the sort of data collection branch can be , uh , asked to do that . And one of the reasons why we 're recording the meeting for these guys is cuz we want their help when we d we start doing uh , recording of subjects . So , yeah { disfmarker } y you 're absolutely right , though . No , you { disfmarker } you will not have , and there it is , and , uh { disfmarker } But you know , y y the , um { disfmarker } Grad D : And I think the other concern that has come up before , too , is if it 's { disfmarker } um { disfmarker } I do n't know if this was collected { disfmarker } what situation this data was collected in . Was it { disfmarker } is it the one that you showed in your talk ? Like people { disfmarker } Grad B : No , no . No . Grad D : But OK . So was this , like , someone actually mobile , like { disfmarker } s using a device ? Grad B : Uh , N no , no not { disfmarker } i it was mobile but not { disfmarker } not with a w a real wizard system . So there were never answers . Grad D : Uh - huh . OK . OK . But , is it { disfmarker } I guess I do n't know { disfmarker } The situation of { disfmarker } of collecting th the data of , like { disfmarker } Here you could imagine them being { disfmarker } walking around the city . as like one situation . And then you have all sorts of other c situational context factors that would influence w how to interpret , like you said , the scope and things like that . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad D : If they 're doing it in a { disfmarker } you know , `` I 'm sitting here with a map and asking questions `` , I { disfmarker } I would imagine that the data would be really different . Um , so it 's just { disfmarker } Grad B : Yeah . But { disfmarker } It was never th th the goal of that data collection to { disfmarker } to serve for sat for such a purpose . So that 's why for example the tasks were not differentiated by intentionality , Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : there was n there was no label , Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : you know , intention A , intention B , intention C . Grad D : Right . Grad B : Or task A , B , C . Um I 'm sure we can produce some if we need it , um , that { disfmarker } that will help us along those lines . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : But , you know , you got ta leave something for other people to model . So , to { disfmarker } Finding out what , you know , situational con what the contextual factors of the situation really are , you know is an interesting s interesting thing . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Grad B : u u Sort of I 'm , at the moment , curious and I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm { disfmarker } s w want to approach it from the end where we can s sort of start with this toy system that we can play around with , Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : so that we get a clearer notion of what input we need for that , Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : what suffices and what does n't . And then we can start worrying about where to get this input , what { disfmarker } what do we need , you know { disfmarker } Ultimately once we are all experts in changing that parser , for example , maybe , there 's just a couple three things we need to do and then we get more whatever , part of speech and more construction - type - like stuff out of it . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Hmm . Grad B : It 's a m pragmatic approach , uh , at the moment . Grad E : How exactly does the data collection work ? Do they have a map , and then you give them a scenario of some sort ? Grad B : OK . Imagine you 're the { disfmarker } the subject . You 're gon na be in here , and somebody { disfmarker } And { disfmarker } and you see , uh , either th the three - D model , or uh , a QuickTime animation of standing u in a square in Heidelberg . So you actually see that . Um . The uh , um , first thing is you have to read a text about Heidelberg . So , just off a textbook , uh , tourist guide , to familiarize , uh , yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names , like Fischergasse and so forth . So that 's part one . Part two is , you 're told that this huge new , wonderful computer system exists , that can y tell you everything you want to know , and it understands you completely . And so you 're gon na pick up that phone , dial a number , and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve . First you have to know { disfmarker } find out how to get to that place , maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there . Maybe { disfmarker } So , the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild . The third one is to get information on the history of an object . The fourth one { disfmarker } And then the g system breaks down . It crashes , And { disfmarker } Grad D : a At the third ? Right then ? Grad B : After the third task . Grad D : OK . Grad B : And then { disfmarker } Or after the fourth . Some find { disfmarker } @ @ { comment } Forget that for now . And then , a human operator comes on , and { disfmarker } and exp apologizes that the system has crashed , but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ? now with a human operator . And so , you have basically the same tasks again , just with different objects , and you go through it again , and that was it . Oh , and one { disfmarker } one little bit { disfmarker } w And uh , the computer you are { disfmarker } you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are , via GPS . When the human operator comes on , um , that person does not know . So the GPS is crashed as well . So the person first has to ask you `` Where are you ? `` . And so you have to do some { disfmarker } s tell the person sort of where you are , depending on what you see there . Um , this is a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a bit that I d I do n't think we { disfmarker } Did we discuss that bit ? Uh , I just sort of squeezed that in now . But it 's something , uh , that would provide some very interesting data for some people I know . So . Grad D : So , in the display you can { disfmarker } Oh , you said that you cou you might have a display that shows , like , the { disfmarker } Grad B : Yeah . a Additionally , y you have a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a sort of a map type display . Grad D : a w your perspective ? sort of ? Grad B : Uh , two - D . Grad D : And so , as you { disfmarker } Grad B : n Grad D : Oh , two - D . OK . Grad B : Two - D . Grad D : So as you move through it that 's - they just track it on the { disfmarker } for themselves Grad B : Yeah . b y You do n't { disfmarker } That 's { disfmarker } Grad D : there . Grad B : I do n't know . I but y I do n't think you really move , sort of . Grad D : OK . So Grad B : Yeah ? I mean that would be an { disfmarker } an { disfmarker } an enormous technical effort , unless we would { disfmarker } We can show it walks to , you know . We can have movies of walking , you walking through { disfmarker } through Heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : Maybe we wan na do that . Yeah . Grad D : Uh , I was just trying to figure out how { disfmarker } how ambitious the system is . Grad B : The map was sort of intended to { disfmarker } You want to go to that place . You know , and it 's sort of there . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : And you see the label of the name { disfmarker } So we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth , and we can change that . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . So your tasks do n't require you to { disfmarker } I mean , uh { disfmarker } yo you 're told { disfmarker } So when your task is , I do n't know , `` Go buy stamps `` or something like that ? So , do you have to respond ? or does your { disfmarker } Uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ? Like , w what you 're doing now ? or { disfmarker } Grad B : Well , we 'll see what people do . Grad D : There 's no { disfmarker } OK , so it 's just like , `` Let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances `` . Grad B : Yeah , and { disfmarker } and we will record both sides . I mean , we will record the Wi - the Wizard { disfmarker } Grad D : Uh - huh . Grad B : I mean , in both cases it 's gon na be a human , in the computer , and in the operator case . Grad D : Uh - huh . Grad B : And we will re there will be some dialogue , you know ? So , you first have to do this , and that , Grad D : Yep . Grad B : and { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : see wh what they say . We can ins instruct the , uh , wizard in how expressive and talkative he should be . But um , maybe the { disfmarker } maybe what you 're suggesting { disfmarker } Is what you 're suggesting that it might be too poor , the data , if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one t uh , task results in a question and then there 's an answer and that 's the end of the task ? You wan na m have it more { disfmarker } more steps , sort of ? Grad D : Yeah , I { disfmarker } I do n't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction { disfmarker } I mean , th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad D : All they know is it 's this great system that could do s stuff . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Oh yeah , but { disfmarker } to some extent this is a different discussion . Grad D : Right ? So { disfmarker } Professor C : OK ? So . Uh , we { disfmarker } we have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff Grad D : Uh - huh . Professor C : and we do have , um , a student who is a candidate for wizard . Uh , she 's gon na get in touch with me . It 's a student of Eve 's . FEY , Fey ? Spelled FEY . Do you { disfmarker } do you { disfmarker } Grad D : Oh , Fey Parrill . Professor C : You know her ? Grad D : Yeah . Uh - huh . Professor C : OK . Sh - Is sh Grad D : She started taking the class last year and then did n't { disfmarker } um , you know , did n't continue . I g She 's a g Professor C : She 's graduated . Grad D : Is she an undergradua She is a graduate , OK . Professor C : Yeah . Grad D : Yeah , I m I know her very , very briefly . I know she was inter you know , interested in aspect and stuff like that . Professor C : OK . So , anyway , she 's looking for some more part time work w while she 's waiting actually for graduate school . And she 'll be in touch . So we may have someone , uh , to do this , and she 's got you know , some background in { disfmarker } in all this stuff . And is a linguist st and , so So . { vocalsound } That 's { disfmarker } So , Nancy , we 'll have an At some point we 'll have another discussion on exactly wha t t you know , how that 's gon na go . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Professor C : And um , Jane , but also , uh , Liz have offered to help us do this , uh , data collection and design and stuff . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Mmm . Professor C : So , when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing . Grad D : OK . I guess the reason I was asking about the sort of the de the details of this kind of thing is that , um , it 's one thing to collect data for , I do n't know , speech recognition or various other tasks that have pretty c clear correct answers , but with intention { vocalsound } um , obviously , as you point out , there 's a lot of di other factors and { disfmarker } I 'm not really sure , um , how { disfmarker } how { disfmarker } e the question of how to make it a t appropriate toy version of that { disfmarker } Um , it 's ju it 's just hard . So , I mean , obviously it 's a { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah , uh , actually I guess that was my question . Is the intention implicit in the scenario that 's given ? Like , do the { disfmarker } Grad D : It is , if they have these tasks that they 're supposed to { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah , I just was n't sure to what level of detail the task was . Grad D : to { disfmarker } to give { disfmarker } Yeah , Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad D : uh { disfmarker } Grad B : n No one is , at the moment . Grad D : Right . Right . Grad E : OK . Professor C : So , we that 's part of what we 'll have to figure out . Grad D : Right . Professor C : But , uh , Grad D : Mm - hmm . Professor C : the { disfmarker } The problem that I was tr gon na try to focus on today was , let 's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which , one way or the other , you were able to , uh , figure out both the intention , and set the context , and know what language was used . So let 's suppose that we can get that kind of data . Um . The issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it so that we get some discrete number of features so that , uh , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the , in this case three little intentions , are most likely . Grad D : w What are the t three intentions ? Is it to go there , to see it , and { disfmarker } Grad B : To come as close as possible to it . Professor C : Th - the terminology we 're using is to { disfmarker } Grad D : Yeah , it 's @ @ . Professor C : Go back . To v Grad D : OK . Professor C : to View it . OK ? To Enter it . Now those { disfmarker } It seems to me those are cl you c you have no trouble with those being distinct . `` Take a picture of it `` you { disfmarker } you might well want to be a really rather different place than entering it . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor C : And , for an object that 's at all big , uh , sort of getting to the nearest part of it uh , could be quite different than either of those . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor C : Just sort of { disfmarker } Grad D : OK , so now I understand the referent of Tango mode . I did n't get that before . Grad E : See , I would have thought it was more of a waltz . Grad B : S To `` Waltz `` it ? Grad D : Yeah , like , how close are you gon na be ? Professor C : Well . Grad D : Like , { vocalsound } Tango 's really close . Grad E : Yeah , cuz a tango { disfmarker } Yeah . Professor C : Well , anyway . So { disfmarker } Grad F : All these So , like , the question is how what features can { disfmarker } like , do you wan na try to extract from , say , the parse or whatever ? Professor C : Right . Grad F : Like , the presence of a word or the presence of a certain uh , stem , or { disfmarker } certain construction or whatever . Professor C : Right . Is there a construction , or the kind of object , or w uh , anything else that 's in the si It 's either in the { disfmarker } in the s the discourse itself or in the context . So if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's uh , a tourist or not , OK ? that becomes a feature . Now , how you determine that is another issue . But fo for the current problem , it would just be , `` OK , if you can be sure that it 's a tourist , versus a businessman , versus a native , `` or something , uh , that would give you a lot of discriminatory power and then just have a little section in your belief - net that said , `` pppt ! `` Though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them , Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : and see ho how it worked , and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . From previous discourse or w any anything else you knew . Grad F : Right . So , how should { disfmarker } What 's the uh , plan ? Like , how should we go about figuring out these { disfmarker } Professor C : OK . So , first of all is , uh , do e either of you guys , you got a favorite belief - net that you 've , you know , played with ? JavaBayes or something ? Grad F : Oh . No , not really . Professor C : OK . Well , anyway . f Get one . OK ? So { disfmarker } y so one of th one of the things we wan na do is actually , uh , pick a package , does n't matter which one , uh , presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities , cuz a lot of what we 're gon na be d You know , we do n't need the one that 'll solve massive , uh , belief - nets quickly . d w These are not gon na get big in { disfmarker } in the foreseeable future . But we do want one in which it 's easy to interact with and , uh , modify . Because i that 's { disfmarker } A lot of what it 's gon na be , is , um , playing with this . And probably one in which it 's easy to have , um , what amounts to transcript files . So that if { disfmarker } if we have all these cases { disfmarker } OK ? So we make up cases that have these features , OK , and then you 'd like to be able to say , `` OK , here 's a bunch of cases `` { disfmarker } There 're even ones tha that you can do learning OK ? So you have all their cases and { disfmarker } and their results and you have a { disfmarker } algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the { disfmarker } the probabilities for you . Um , probably that 's not worth it . I mean , my guess is we are n't gon na have enough data that 's good enough to make the { disfmarker } these data fitting ones worth it , but I do n't know . So I would say you guy the first task for you two guys is to um , pick a package . OK , and you wan na it s You know , the standard things you want it stable , you want it { disfmarker } yeah , @ @ . And , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , uh , make a first cut at what 's going on . Grad B : An - Nuh . Professor C : But it { disfmarker } what I like about it is it 's very concrete . OK ? We { disfmarker } we have a { disfmarker } we know what the outcomes are gon na be , and we have some { disfmarker } some data that 's loose , we can use our own intuition , and see how hard it is , and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need . So it { disfmarker } if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to { disfmarker } You know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . That 'd be really interesting . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad B : And it { disfmarker } and it may serve as a platform for a person , maybe me , or whoever , who is interested in doing some linguistic analysis . I mean , w we have the For - FrameNet group here , and we can see what they have found out about those concepts already , that are contained in the data , um , you know , to come up with a nice little set of features and um , maybe even means of s uh , extracting them . And { disfmarker } and that altogether could also be { disfmarker } uh , become a nice paper that 's going to be published somewhere , if we sit down and write it . And um { disfmarker } When you said JavaBayes belief - net you were talking about ones that run on coffee ? or that are in the program language Java ? Professor C : No , th It turns out that there is a , uh { disfmarker } The new end of Java libraries . OK , and it turns out one called Grad B : Mmm . OK . Professor C : Which is one that fair { disfmarker } people around here use a fair amount . I have no idea whether that 's { disfmarker } The obvious advantage of that is that you can then , relatively easily , get all the other Java packages for GUIs or whatever else you might want to do . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : So that i that 's I think why a lot of people doing research use that . But it may not be { disfmarker } I have no idea whether that 's the best choice an and there 're plenty of people around , students in the department who , you know , live and breathe Bayes - nets . So , uh , Grad D : There 's the m tool kit that um , Kevin Murphy has developed , Professor C : Right . It 's OK . Grad D : which might be useful too . Grad F : Right . Professor C : So , yeah , Kevin would be a good person to start with . Grad D : And it 's available Matlab code . Professor C : Nancy knows him well . I do n't know I do n't know whether you guys have met Kevin yet or not , Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : but , uh { disfmarker } Grad F : Yeah , I know him . Grad B : But i But since we all probably are pretty sure that , um , the { disfmarker } Professor C : Yeah . Grad B : For example , this th th the dialogue history is { disfmarker } is um , producing XML documents . M - three - L of course is XML . And the ontology that um , uh the student is { disfmarker } is constructing for me back in { disfmarker } in EML is in OIL and that 's also in XML . And so that 's where a lot of knowledge about bakeries , about hotels , about castles and stuff is gon na come from . Professor C : Mm - hmm . Yeah . Grad B : Um , so , if it has that IO capability and if it 's a Java package , it will definitely be able { disfmarker } We can couple . Professor C : Yeah . So , yeah , we 're sort of { nonvocalsound } committed to XML as the kind of , uh , interchange . But that 's , you know , not a big deal . Grad B : Who is n't , nuh ? Professor C : So , in terms of { disfmarker } of { disfmarker } interchanging in and out of any module we build , It 'll be XML . And if you 're going off to queries to the ontology , for example , you 'll have to deal with its interface . But that 's { disfmarker } that 's fine an and um , all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind . So they { disfmarker } they have worked very hard . It 's kind of blackboards and multi - wave blackboards and ways of interchanging and registering your a And so forth . So , that I do n't think is even worth us worrying about just yet . I mean if we can get the core of the thing to work , in a way that we 're comfortable with , then we ca we can get in and out of it with , uh , XML , um , little descriptors . I believe . Grad B : Hmm . Yeah . Yeah , I like , for example , the { disfmarker } what you said about the getting input from { disfmarker } from just files about where you h where you have the data , have specified the features and so forth . Professor C : I do n't { disfmarker } I do n't see { disfmarker } Grad B : That 's , of course , easy also to do with , you know , XML . Professor C : Uh , you could have an X { disfmarker } yeah , you could make and XML format for that . Sure . Grad B : So r Professor C : That { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } um , you know , feature value XML format is probably as good a way as any . So it 's als Yeah , I guess it 's also worth , um , while you 're poking around , poke around for XML packages that um , do things you 'd like . Grad F : Does n't { disfmarker } does SmartKom system have such packages ? Grad B : Yeah . Professor C : Sure . Grad B : The { disfmarker } the lib M - three - L library does that . It 's also { disfmarker } Professor C : And the question is , d you c you { disfmarker } you 'll have to l We 'll have to l That should be { disfmarker } ay We should be able to look at that { disfmarker } Grad B : No , u u y um the { disfmarker } What I { disfmarker } What sort of came to my mind i is { disfmarker } was the notion of an idea that if { disfmarker } if there are l nets that can actually lear try to set their own , um , probability factors based on { disfmarker } on { disfmarker } on { disfmarker } on input { disfmarker } Professor C : Yeah . Grad B : which is in file format , if we , um , get really w wild on this , we may actually want to use some { disfmarker } some corpora that other people made and , for example , if { disfmarker } if they are in { disfmarker } in MATE , then we get X M L documents with discourse annotations , t you know , t from the discourse act down to the phonetic level . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad B : Um , Michael has a project where { disfmarker } you know , recognizing discourse acts and he does it all in MATE , and so they 're actually annotating data and data and data . So if we w if we think it 's worth it one of these days , not { disfmarker } not with this first prototype but maybe with a second , and we have the possibility of { disfmarker } of taking input that 's generated elsewhere and learn from that , that 'd be nice . Grad F : Right . Professor C : It 'd be nice , but { disfmarker } but I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I do I do n't wan na count on it . I mean , you ca n't { disfmarker } you ca n't run your project based on the speculation that { disfmarker } that the data will come , Grad B : No , no , uh , just for { disfmarker } Professor C : and you do n't have to actually design the nets . Grad B : Nuh . Just a back door that { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I think we should devote m Professor C : Could happen . Yeah . So in terms of { disfmarker } of the , um { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } what the SmartKom gives us for M - three - L packages , it could be that they 're fine , or it could be eeh . You do n't { disfmarker } You know , you do n't really like it . So we 're not { disfmarker } we 're not abs we 're not required to use their packages . We are required at the end to give them stuff in their format , but hey . Grad F : Right . Professor C : Um , it 's , uh { disfmarker } It does n't control what you do in you know , internally . Grad B :  Grad E : What 's the time frame for this ? Grad B : Two days ? Two , three days ? Professor C : Huh ? Yeah bu w I 'd like that this { disfmarker } y yeah , this week , to ha to n to { vocalsound } have y guys , uh , you know , pick { vocalsound } the { disfmarker } y you know , belief - net package Grad B : No . Professor C : and tell us what it is , and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something . Grad F : Sure . Professor C : And , then as soon as we have it , I think we should start trying to populate it for this problem . Make a first cut at , you know , what 's going on , and probably the ea easiest way to do that is some on - line way . I mean , you can f figure out whether you wan na make it a web site or { disfmarker } You know , how Grad B : Uh { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } um , OK , I { disfmarker } t Yeah . I was actually more joking . With the two or three days . So this was { disfmarker } was a usual jo Professor C : OK , I was n't . Grad B : Um , it will take as long as y y yo you guys need for that . Professor C : Yeah . Right . Grad B : But um , maybe it might be interesting if { disfmarker } if the two of you can agree on who 's gon na be the speaker next Monday , to tell us something about the net you picked , and what it does , and how it does that . Professor C : Well , y Well , or both of them speak . Grad F : Sure . Grad B : Yeah , or you can split it up . Professor C : We do n't care . Grad B : So , y Grad F : Hmm . Grad B : So that will be sort of the assignment for next week , is to { disfmarker } to { disfmarker } for slides and whatever net you picked and what it can do and { disfmarker } and how far you 've gotten . Pppt ! Professor C : Well , I 'd like to also , though , uh , ha have a first cut at what the belief - net looks like . Even if it 's really crude . OK ? So , you know , here a here are { disfmarker } Grad E : So we 're supposed to @ @ about features and whatnot , Professor C : Right . Yeah . Grad E : and { disfmarker } Grad F : Mm - hmm . Professor C : And , as I said , what I 'd like to do is , I mean , what would be really great is you bring it in { disfmarker } If { disfmarker } if { disfmarker } if we could , uh , in the meeting , say , you know , `` Here 's the package , here 's the current one we have , `` uh , you know , `` What other ideas do you have ? `` and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file . Of , uh , you know , get a { disfmarker } t a p tentative format for it , let 's say XML , that says , l you know , `` These are the various scenarios we 've experienced . `` We can just add to that and there 'll be this { disfmarker } this file of them and when you think you 've got a better belief - net , You just run it against this , um { disfmarker } this data file . Grad F : So we 'll be like , hand , uh , doing all the probabilities . Professor C : Oh , yeah , unt until we know more . Grad F : OK . Grad E : And what 's the relation to this with { disfmarker } Changing the table so that the system works in English ? Grad B : OK . So this is { disfmarker } Whi - while you were doing this , I received two lovely emails . The { disfmarker } the full NT and the full Linux version are there . I 've downloaded them both , and I started to unpack the Linux one { disfmarker } Uh , the NT one worked fine . and I started unta pack the Linux one , it told me that I ca n't really unpack it because it contains a future date . So this is the time difference between Germany . I had to wait until one o ' clock this afternoon before I was able to unpack it . Now , um { disfmarker } Then it will be my job to get this whole thing running both on Swede and on this machine . And so that we have it . And then um { disfmarker } Hopefully that { disfmarker } hoping that my urgent message will now come through to Ralph and Tilman that it will send some more documentation along , we { disfmarker } I control p Maybe that 's what I will do next Monday is show the state and show the system and show that . Professor C : Yeah . Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate . Uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net . Grad E : I guess my question was more about time frame . So we 're gon na do belief - nets this week , and then { disfmarker } Professor C : Oh , yeah . I do n't know . n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line , in the sense that over the next month there 's a { disfmarker } there 's a deliverable . Grad E : OK . Professor C : OK . S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic . If { disfmarker } if { disfmarker } you know , if we do n't get any information for these guys f for several weeks then we are n't gon na sit around , you know , wasting time , trying to do the problem or guess what they { disfmarker } You know , just pppt ! go on and do other things . Grad E : OK . Grad B : Yeah , but uh { disfmarker } but the uh { disfmarker } This point is really { disfmarker } I think very , very valid that ultimately we hope that { disfmarker } that both will merge into a harmonious and , um , wonderful , um , state where we can not only do the bare necessities , IE , changing the table so it does exactly in English what it does in German , but also that we can sort of have the system where we can say , `` OK , this is what it usually does , and now we add this little thing to it `` , you know ? whatever , Johno 's and Bhaskara 's great belief - net , and we plug it in , and then for these certain tasks , and we know that navigational tasks are gon na be a core domain of the new system , it all { disfmarker } all of a sudden it does much better . Nuh ? Because it can produce better answers , tell the person , as I s showed you on this map , n you know , produce either you know , a red line that goes to the Vista point or a red line that goes to the Tango point or red line that goes to the door , which would be great . So not only can you show that you know something sensible but ultimately , if you produce a system like this , it takes the person where it wants to go . Rather than taking him always to the geometric center of a building , Grad F : Mmm . Grad B : which is what they do now . And we even had to take out a bit . Nancy , you missed that part . We had to take out a bit of the road work . So that it does n't take you to the wall { vocalsound } every time . Grad D : Oh , really ? Grad B : So . Um { disfmarker } So this was actually an actual problem that we encountered , which nobody have { disfmarker } has { disfmarker } because car navigation systems do n't really care . You know , they get you to the beginning of the street , some now do the house number . Grad D : Hmm . Grad B : But even that is problematic . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : If you go d If you wan na drive to the SAP in Waldorf , I 'm sure the same is true of Microsoft , it takes you to the { disfmarker } the address , whatever , street number blah - blah - blah , you are miles away from the entrance . Professor C : Yep . Grad B : Because the s postal address is maybe a mailbox somewhere . Nuh ? Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : but the entrance where you actually wan na go is somewhere completely different . So unless you 're a mail person you really do n't wan na go there . Grad D : Right , yeah . Professor C : Probably not then , cuz y you probably ca n't drop the mail there anyway . Grad B : Probably neither { disfmarker } e not even that . Professor C : Yeah . Clear ? Grad F : OK . Sounds good . Grad E : The Powder - Tower is made of red limestone . Grad D : I was wondering . Grad B : Do you wan na see a picture ? Grad D : OK . Sure ! Grad E : Sure ! Grad B : Have to reboot for that though . Grad D : Um . So , you two , who 'll be working on this , li are { disfmarker } are you gl will you be doing { disfmarker } Well , I mean are you supposed to just do it by thinking about the situation ? Can you use the sample data ? Professor C : Of course they use the sample data . Grad D : Is it like { disfmarker } Yeah , I mean , ho is there more than { disfmarker } Is there a lot s of sample data that is beyond what you { disfmarker } what you have there ? Grad B : There { disfmarker } there 's more than I showed , but um , um , I think this is sort of um , in part my job to look at that and { disfmarker } and to see whether there are features in there that can be extracted , Grad D : Yeah . Grad B : and to come up with some features that are not you know , empirically based on { disfmarker } on a real experiment or on { disfmarker } on { disfmarker } on reality Grad D : Right . Mm - hmm . Grad B : but sort of on your intuition of you know , `` Aha ! This is maybe a sign for that , Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Mm - hmm . Grad B : and this is maybe a sign for this . `` Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : So , yeah . Later this week we should sort of get together , and sort of start thinking about that , hopefully . Grad B : Talk features . Yep . Professor C : OK . We can end the meeting and call Adam , and then we wan na s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg . We can do that as well . Grad B : Well they had { disfmarker } they used the ammunition { disfmarker } They stored the ammunition in that tower . Professor C : Uh , is that OK ? Grad B : And that 's why , when it was hit by uh , a cannon ball , it exploded . Professor C : Alright . Oh . Ni Grad E : It exploded . That 's why they call it the Powder - Tower . Grad B : Ahh . Grad E : OK . I first thought it had something to do with the material that it { disfmarker } w that 's why I asked . Grad D : That 's right , OK . Grad B : Mmm . 
Query : Summarize the discussion about setting up the recording equipment Grad E : I guess . Grad A : OK , we 're on . So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless . Grad E : Check one . Check one . Grad A : And you should be able to see which one { disfmarker } which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change . Grad B : So , which is my bar ? Mah ! Number one . Grad A : Yep . Grad E : Sibilance . Sibilance . Grad A : So , actually , if you guys wan na go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright . Grad E : Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ? Grad A : No . No . Grad E : Oh , OK . Grad A : Each individually . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . { vocalsound } To try to read them while everyone else is . Grad E : Everyone would need extreme focus . Grad A : So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on . Professor C : Other way . We m We may wind up with ver We { disfmarker } we may need versions of all this garbage . Grad B : For our stuff . Yeah . Professor C : Yeah . Grad A : Um . So the first thing you 'd wan na do is just say which transcript you 're on . Professor C : Yeah . Grad A : So . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give { disfmarker } I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about { pause } stuff before everyone 's here . Professor C : Mmm . Well , we have one more coming . Grad A : OK . Well , why do n't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there . Professor C : OK . Well , we can start doing it . Grad A : Thanks . So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you do n't breathe into the mike . Um . Yeah , that 's good . And uh { disfmarker } So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . And the short form { disfmarker } I mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you do n't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you do n't like . Um . On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . If you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . So , do n't worry too much about it . The { disfmarker } It 's just self rating . Um . And I think that 's about it . I mean , should I { disfmarker } Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ? Professor C : Um , yeah . Grad A : or { disfmarker } ? Professor C : No . There was { disfmarker } there was { disfmarker } Let 's see . Oh { disfmarker } Grad E : Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ? Grad B : I sent an email . Professor C : She got an emai she was notified . Grad E : Oh yeah , she got an e Yeah , yeah . Professor C : Whether she knows { vocalsound } is another question . Um . So are the people going to be identified by name ? Grad A : Well , what we 're gon na { disfmarker } we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . Um , but not in the audio . Professor C : Right . Grad A : So the Professor C : OK . So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . Since it { disfmarker } it does is n't attributed . Oh , I see , but the a but the { disfmarker } but the { disfmarker } Grad A : Right , so if I said , `` Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? `` , we 're not gon na go through and cancel out the `` Jerry `` s . Professor C : Yeah . Sure . Grad A : Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight . Professor C : Right . Grad A : Um , but uh , Professor C : Right . Grad A : um , it w uh , I do n't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data . Professor C : OK . Mm - hmm . No , I { disfmarker } I was n't complaining , Grad A : Yep . Professor C : I just wanted to understand . Grad A : Right . Professor C : OK . Grad B : Well , we can make up aliases for each of us . Grad A : Yeah , I mean , whatever you wan na do is fine , Professor C : Right . Grad F : OK . Grad A : but we find that { disfmarker } We want the meeting to be as natural as possible . So , we 're trying to do real meetings . Professor C : OK . Grad A : And so we do n't wan na have to do aliases Professor C : Right . Grad A : and we do n't want people to be editing what they say . Grad B : Right . Grad A : So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft . Professor C : Right . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad A : You know ? Professor C : Right . Um , OK . So why do n't you tell us briefly Grad A : OK . So th Professor C : your { disfmarker } give { disfmarker } give your e normal schpiel . Grad A : Um . So this is { disfmarker } The project is called Meeting Recorder and there are lots of different aspects of the project . Um . So my particular interest is in the PDA of the future . This is a mock - up of one . Yes , we do believe the PDA of the future will be made of wood . Um . { comment } The idea is that you 'd be able to put a PDA at the table at an impromptu meeting , and record it , and then be able to do querying and retrieval later on , on the meeting . So that 's my particular interest , is a portable device to do m uh , information retrieval on meetings . Other people are interested in other aspects of meetings . Um . So the first step on that , in any of these , is to collect some data . And so what we wanted is a room that 's instrumented with both the table top microphones , and these are very high quality pressure zone mikes , as well as the close talking mikes . What the close talk ng talking mikes gives us is some ground truth , gives us , um , high quality audio , um , especially for people who are n't interested in the acoustic parts of this corpus . So , for people who are more interested in language , we did n't want to penalize them by having only the far field mikes available . And then also , um , it 's a very , very hard task in terms of speech recognition . Um . And so , uh , on the far field mikes we can expect very low recognition results . So we wanted the near field mikes to at least isolate the difference between the two . So that 's why we 're recording in parallel with the close talking and the far field at the same time . And then , all these channels are recorded simultaneously and framed synchronously so that you can also do things like , um , beam - forming on all the microphones and do research like that . Our intention is to release this data to the public , um , probably through f through a body like the LDC . And , uh , just make it as a generally available corpus . Um . { vocalsound } There 's other work going on in meeting recording . So , we 're { disfmarker } we 're working with SRI , with UW , Um . NIST has started an effort which will include video . We 're not including video , obviously . And uh { disfmarker } and then also , um , a small amount of assistance from IBM . Is also involved . Um . Oh , and the digit strings , this is just a more constrained task . Um . So because the general environment is so challenging , we decided to { disfmarker } to do at least one set of digit strings to give ourselves something easier . And it 's exactly the same digit strings as in TI - digits , which is a common connected digits corpus . So we 'll have some , um , comparison to be able to be made . Professor C : OK . Grad A : Anything else ? Professor C : No . Grad A : OK , so when the l last person comes in , just have them wear a wireless . It should be on already . Um . Either one of those . And uh , read the digit strings and { disfmarker } and fill out the forms . So , the most important form is the consent form , so just be s be sure everyone signs that , if they consent . Grad B : I 'm sure it 's pretty usual for meetings that people come late , Grad A : Yeah . Grad B : so you will have to leave what you set . Grad A : Right . And uh , just give me a call , which , my number 's up there when your meeting is over . Professor C : Yep . Grad A : And { disfmarker } I 'm going to leave the mike here but it 's n { nonvocalsound } Uh , but I 'm not gon na be on so do n't have them use this one . It 'll just be sitting here . Grad B : Input ? Yeah . There we go . Professor C : By the way , Adam , we will be using the , uh , screen as well . Grad B : Yep . Professor C : So , you know . Wow ! Organization . So you guys who got email about this { pause } oh f uh , Friday or something about what we 're up to . Grad E : No . Grad F : No . Grad B : I got it . Grad E : What was the nature of the email ? Professor C : Oh , this was about { pause } um , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words , like `` s go to see `` , or `` visit `` , or some Grad B : Wel - we I { disfmarker } uh { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } Professor C : You did n't get it ? Grad E : I do n't think I did . Professor C : I guess these g have got better filters . Cuz I sent it to everybody . You just blew it off . Grad E : Ah . Professor C : OK . 
Query : What did C think about setting up the recording equipment ? Professor C : Other way . We m We may wind up with ver We { disfmarker } we may need versions of all this garbage . Grad B : For our stuff . Yeah . Professor C : Yeah . Grad A : Um . So the first thing you 'd wan na do is just say which transcript you 're on . Professor C : Yeah . Grad A : So . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines . And the pause is just so the person transcribing it can tell where one line ends and the other begins . And I 'll give { disfmarker } I 'll read the digit strings first , so can see how that goes . Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about { pause } stuff before everyone 's here . Professor C : Mmm . Well , we have one more coming . Grad A : OK . Well , why do n't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there . Professor C : OK . Well , we can start doing it . Professor C : Whether she knows { vocalsound } is another question . Um . So are the people going to be identified by name ? Grad A : Well , what we 're gon na { disfmarker } we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . Um , but not in the audio . Professor C : Right . Grad A : So the Professor C : OK . So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . Since it { disfmarker } it does is n't attributed . Oh , I see , but the a but the { disfmarker } but the { disfmarker } Grad A : Right , so if I said , `` Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? `` , we 're not gon na go through and cancel out the `` Jerry `` s . Professor C : Yeah . Sure . Grad A : Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight . Professor C : Right . Grad A : Um , but uh , Professor C : Right . Grad A : um , it w uh , I do n't know a good way of doing it on the audio , and still have people who are doing discourse research be able to use the data . Professor C : OK . Mm - hmm . No , I { disfmarker } I was n't complaining , Grad A : Yep . Professor C : I just wanted to understand . Grad A : Right . Professor C : OK . Grad B : Well , we can make up aliases for each of us . Grad A : Yeah , I mean , whatever you wan na do is fine , Professor C : Right . Grad F : OK . Grad A : but we find that { disfmarker } We want the meeting to be as natural as possible .

Grad B : Right . Grad A : So I think that it 's better just as a pro post - process to edit out every time you bash Microsoft . Professor C : Right . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad A : You know ? Professor C : Right . Um , OK . So why do n't you tell us briefly 
Query : What did A think about setting up the recording equipment ? Grad E : I guess . Grad A : OK , we 're on . So just make sure that th your wireless mike is on , if you 're wearing a wireless . Grad E : Check one . Check one . Grad A : And you should be able to see which one { disfmarker } which one you 're on by , uh , watching the little bars change . Grad B : So , which is my bar ? Mah ! Number one . Grad A : Yep . Grad E : Sibilance . Sibilance . Grad A : So , actually , if you guys wan na go ahead and read digits now , as long as you 've signed the consent form , that 's alright . Grad E : Are we supposed to read digits at the same time ? Grad A : No . No . Grad E : Oh , OK . Grad A : Each individually . We 're talking about doing all at the same time but I think cognitively that would be really difficult . { vocalsound } To try to read them while everyone else is . Grad E : Everyone would need extreme focus . Grad A : So , when you 're reading the digit strings , the first thing to do is just say which transcript you 're on . Professor C : Other way . We m We may wind up with ver We { disfmarker } we may need versions of all this garbage . Grad B : For our stuff . Yeah . Professor C : Yeah . Grad A : Um . So the first thing you 'd wan na do is just say which transcript you 're on . Professor C : Yeah . Grad A : So . You can see the transcript ? There 's two large number strings on the digits ? So you would just read that one . And then you read each line with a small pause between the lines .

Um . Again , I 'm not sure how much I should talk about { pause } stuff before everyone 's here . Professor C : Mmm . Well , we have one more coming . Grad A : OK . Well , why do n't I go ahead and read digit strings and then we can go on from there . Professor C : OK . Well , we can start doing it . Grad A : Thanks . So , uh , just also a note on wearing the microphones . All of you look like you 're doing it reasonably correctly , but you want it about two thumb widths away from your mouth , and then , at the corner . And that 's so that you minimize breath sounds , so that when you 're breathing , you do n't breathe into the mike . Um . Yeah , that 's good . And uh { disfmarker } So , everyone needs to fill out , only once , the speaker form and the consent form . And the short form { disfmarker } I mean , you should read the consent form , but uh , the thing to notice is that we will give you an opportunity to edit a all the transcripts . So , if you say things and you do n't want them to be released to the general public , which , these will be available at some point to anyone who wants them , uh , you 'll be given an opportunity by email , uh , to bleep out any portions you do n't like . Um . On the speaker form just fill out as much of the information as you can . If you 're not exactly sure about the region , we 're not exactly sure either . So , do n't worry too much about it . The { disfmarker } It 's just self rating . Um . And I think that 's about it . I mean , should I { disfmarker } Do you want me to talk at all about why we 're doing this and what this project is ? Professor C : Um , yeah . Grad A : or { disfmarker } ? Professor C : No . There was { disfmarker } there was { disfmarker } Let 's see . Oh { disfmarker } Grad E : Does Nancy know that we 're meeting in here ? Grad B : I sent an email . Professor C : She got an emai she was notified . Grad E : Oh yeah , she got an e Yeah , yeah . Professor C : Whether she knows { vocalsound } is another question . Um . So are the people going to be identified by name ? Grad A : Well , what we 're gon na { disfmarker } we 'll anonymize it in the transcript . Um , but not in the audio . Professor C : Right . Grad A : So the Professor C : OK . So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely . Since it { disfmarker } it does is n't attributed . Oh , I see , but the a but the { disfmarker } but the { disfmarker } Grad A : Right , so if I said , `` Oh , hi Jerry , how are you ? `` , we 're not gon na go through and cancel out the `` Jerry `` s . Professor C : Yeah . Sure . Grad A : Um , so we will go through and , in the speaker ID tags there 'll be , you know , M - one O seven , M - one O eight . Professor C : Right .

Query : Summarize the discussion about the experimental setup of the computer navigation system Grad E : How exactly does the data collection work ? Do they have a map , and then you give them a scenario of some sort ? Grad B : OK . Imagine you 're the { disfmarker } the subject . You 're gon na be in here , and somebody { disfmarker } And { disfmarker } and you see , uh , either th the three - D model , or uh , a QuickTime animation of standing u in a square in Heidelberg . So you actually see that . Um . The uh , um , first thing is you have to read a text about Heidelberg . So , just off a textbook , uh , tourist guide , to familiarize , uh , yourself with that sort of odd - sounding German street names , like Fischergasse and so forth . So that 's part one . Part two is , you 're told that this huge new , wonderful computer system exists , that can y tell you everything you want to know , and it understands you completely . And so you 're gon na pick up that phone , dial a number , and you get a certain amount of tasks that you have to solve . First you have to know { disfmarker } find out how to get to that place , maybe with the intention of buying stamps in there . Maybe { disfmarker } So , the next task is to get to a certain place and take a picture for your grandchild . The third one is to get information on the history of an object . The fourth one { disfmarker } And then the g system breaks down . It crashes , And { disfmarker } Grad D : a At the third ? Right then ? Grad B : After the third task . Grad D : OK . Grad B : And then { disfmarker } Or after the fourth . Some find { disfmarker } @ @ { comment } Forget that for now . And then , a human operator comes on , and { disfmarker } and exp apologizes that the system has crashed , but , you know , urges you to continue , you know ? now with a human operator . And so , you have basically the same tasks again , just with different objects , and you go through it again , and that was it . Oh , and one { disfmarker } one little bit { disfmarker } w And uh , the computer you are { disfmarker } you are being told the computer system knows exactly where you are , via GPS . When the human operator comes on , um , that person does not know . So the GPS is crashed as well . So the person first has to ask you `` Where are you ? `` . And so you have to do some { disfmarker } s tell the person sort of where you are , depending on what you see there . Um , this is a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a bit that I d I do n't think we { disfmarker } Did we discuss that bit ? Uh , I just sort of squeezed that in now . But it 's something , uh , that would provide some very interesting data for some people I know . So . Grad D : So , in the display you can { disfmarker } Oh , you said that you cou you might have a display that shows , like , the { disfmarker } Grad B : Yeah . a Additionally , y you have a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a sort of a map type display . Grad D : a w your perspective ? sort of ? Grad B : Uh , two - D . Grad D : And so , as you { disfmarker } Grad B : n Grad D : Oh , two - D . OK . Grad B : Two - D . Grad D : So as you move through it that 's - they just track it on the { disfmarker } for themselves Grad B : Yeah . b y You do n't { disfmarker } That 's { disfmarker } Grad D : there . Grad B : I do n't know . I but y I do n't think you really move , sort of . Grad D : OK . So Grad B : Yeah ? I mean that would be an { disfmarker } an { disfmarker } an enormous technical effort , unless we would { disfmarker } We can show it walks to , you know . We can have movies of walking , you walking through { disfmarker } through Heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : Maybe we wan na do that . Yeah . Grad D : Uh , I was just trying to figure out how { disfmarker } how ambitious the system is . Grad B : The map was sort of intended to { disfmarker } You want to go to that place . You know , and it 's sort of there . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : And you see the label of the name { disfmarker } So we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth , and we can change that . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . So your tasks do n't require you to { disfmarker } I mean , uh { disfmarker } yo you 're told { disfmarker } So when your task is , I do n't know , `` Go buy stamps `` or something like that ? So , do you have to respond ? or does your { disfmarker } Uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ? Like , w what you 're doing now ? or { disfmarker } Grad B : Well , we 'll see what people do . Grad D : There 's no { disfmarker } OK , so it 's just like , `` Let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances `` . Grad B : Yeah , and { disfmarker } and we will record both sides . I mean , we will record the Wi - the Wizard { disfmarker } Grad D : Uh - huh . Grad B : I mean , in both cases it 's gon na be a human , in the computer , and in the operator case . Grad D : Uh - huh . Grad B : And we will re there will be some dialogue , you know ? So , you first have to do this , and that , Grad D : Yep . Grad B : and { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : see wh what they say . We can ins instruct the , uh , wizard in how expressive and talkative he should be . But um , maybe the { disfmarker } maybe what you 're suggesting { disfmarker } Is what you 're suggesting that it might be too poor , the data , if we sort of limit it to this ping pong one t uh , task results in a question and then there 's an answer and that 's the end of the task ? You wan na m have it more { disfmarker } more steps , sort of ? Grad D : Yeah , I { disfmarker } I do n't know how much direction is given to the subject about what their interaction { disfmarker } I mean , th they 're unfamiliar w with interacting with the system . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Grad D : All they know is it 's this great system that could do s stuff . Grad B : Mm - hmm . Professor C : Oh yeah , but { disfmarker } to some extent this is a different discussion . Grad D : Right ? So { disfmarker } Professor C : OK ? So . Uh , we { disfmarker } we have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff Grad D : Uh - huh . Professor C : and we do have , um , a student who is a candidate for wizard . Uh , she 's gon na get in touch with me . It 's a student of Eve 's . FEY , Fey ? Spelled FEY . Do you { disfmarker } do you { disfmarker } Grad D : Oh , Fey Parrill . Professor C : You know her ? Grad D : Yeah . Uh - huh . Professor C : OK . Sh - Is sh Grad D : She started taking the class last year and then did n't { disfmarker } um , you know , did n't continue . I g She 's a g Professor C : She 's graduated . Grad D : Is she an undergradua She is a graduate , OK . Professor C : Yeah . Grad D : Yeah , I m I know her very , very briefly . I know she was inter you know , interested in aspect and stuff like that . Professor C : OK . So , anyway , she 's looking for some more part time work w while she 's waiting actually for graduate school . And she 'll be in touch . So we may have someone , uh , to do this , and she 's got you know , some background in { disfmarker } in all this stuff . And is a linguist st and , so So . { vocalsound } That 's { disfmarker } So , Nancy , we 'll have an At some point we 'll have another discussion on exactly wha t t you know , how that 's gon na go . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Professor C : And um , Jane , but also , uh , Liz have offered to help us do this , uh , data collection and design and stuff . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Mmm . Professor C : So , when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing .

Grad D : So as you move through it that 's - they just track it on the { disfmarker } for themselves Grad B : Yeah . b y You do n't { disfmarker } That 's { disfmarker } Grad D : there . Grad B : I do n't know . I but y I do n't think you really move , sort of . Grad D : OK . So Grad B : Yeah ? I mean that would be an { disfmarker } an { disfmarker } an enormous technical effort , unless we would { disfmarker } We can show it walks to , you know . We can have movies of walking , you walking through { disfmarker } through Heidelberg , and u ultimately arriving there . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : Maybe we wan na do that . Yeah . Grad D : Uh , I was just trying to figure out how { disfmarker } how ambitious the system is . Grad B : The map was sort of intended to { disfmarker } You want to go to that place . You know , and it 's sort of there . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Grad B : And you see the label of the name { disfmarker } So we get those names , pronunciation stuff , and so forth , and we can change that . Grad D : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . So your tasks do n't require you to { disfmarker } I mean , uh { disfmarker } yo you 're told { disfmarker } So when your task is , I do n't know , `` Go buy stamps `` or something like that ? So , do you have to respond ? or does your { disfmarker } Uh , what are you ste what are you supposed to be telling the system ? Like , w what you 're doing now ? or { disfmarker } Grad B : Well , we 'll see what people do . Grad D : There 's no { disfmarker } OK , so it 's just like , `` Let 's figure out what they would say under the circumstances `` . Grad D : She started taking the class last year and then did n't { disfmarker } um , you know , did n't continue . I g She 's a g Professor C : She 's graduated . Grad D : Is she an undergradua She is a graduate , OK . Professor C : Yeah . Grad D : Yeah , I m I know her very , very briefly . I know she was inter you know , interested in aspect and stuff like that . 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Project Manager : Okay . Uh door is closed . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well , let 's begin . Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we 'll have to hurry up . Marketing : I 'm listening . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Right . Project Manager : Um well I 'll start with the presentation again , the agenda . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Great . Project Manager : Yo . So . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } This one I think . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Uh yeah . Well alright . Um well , I 'll show you the notes . It 's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting , Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : but I 'll show them . We 'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . Um { disfmarker } Then we 'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . I 've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : So { vocalsound } this time we exactly know what to decide about . Marketing : { vocalsound } Alright , great . Project Manager : And then we 'll close again . Industrial Designer : Alright . Project Manager : Uh { disfmarker } Well these are some examples , but we 'll talk about them later . We 'll { vocalsound } first look at your uh presentations . Alright ? Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Walter will uh start again this time ? Marketing : Yeah , great . Project Manager : Yo . Marketing : Alright , Trendwatch . Project Manager : 'Kay . Marketing : { gap } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Right . I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do . Project Manager : 'Kay . Marketing : Uh the trends . { vocalsound } It 's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . Uh this because of our last model was very functional , but { vocalsound } it uh people did n't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . That 's uh something you uh have to take a look at . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Alright . Marketing : And uh the feeling has to be very great . Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great . Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : Um there 's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . This is uh two times as less important , Project Manager : Less . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : and uh same for this one . { vocalsound } Um , technological technological innovations , that 's uh regarded very highly too . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier . Project Manager : Well , yeah . Marketing : So we have to have uh something like that , like we uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts . Marketing : Right . { vocalsound } Uh the last point is easy to use . Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . I do n't know who 's uh who 's going to look at that . Industrial Designer : Easy to use ? Project Manager : Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah ? Industrial Designer : I think that 's your ta User Interface : { gap } Project Manager : Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . Marketing : Yeah , I know . Project Manager : Well we have to choose one of them . { vocalsound } Marketing : I think we have to go for the first one . Project Manager : Yeah . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : It 's the most important one . So { gap } we have to uh take that one . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : So it it { vocalsound } it is n't very important that { vocalsound } that it works easy . User Interface : Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } But { vocalsound } it has to look great . Project Manager : Yeah . We 'll we 'll look at uh { gap } . Industrial Designer : You { disfmarker } Yeah . Yeah , yeah , Marketing : We 'll see . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use { disfmarker } { vocalsound } It 's not a very comp complicated device . Marketing : Yeah , right . But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say { gap } wow , that 's real great uh great concept . Project Manager : 'Kay . Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : Alright . Uh these are the new colours of this year . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : So it must be very bright , very colourful . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : People like this . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : So we we have to think uh in this direction . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Marketing : So i set your mind to it . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : Findings ? Fashion update ? Fruit and vegetables are cool . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Uh you think ? Marketing : I am told . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : So { vocalsound } we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah , well { disfmarker } User Interface : Bananas . Marketing : Uh furthermore uh material , that 's your part , should be very strong . I was thinking of something like uh { vocalsound } well uh iron plate over it , Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : maybe in a colour or something , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong . Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : B Marketing : And that 's uh also for the younger public . Project Manager : Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . Th this year it 's fruits but next year it 's it 's something totally different . Marketing : Yeah , that 's great . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin . Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily . Project Manager : Yep , alright . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Well , the don'ts . Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . Well we do n't want uh older people , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : we want young people . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { gap } Marketing : So uh we 're gon na turn that around . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : We 're gon na have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours . Right ? Project Manager : Wood is popular . Aha . Marketing : Okay . We do n't want wood . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah yeah yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah , among the old people , yeah . Marketing : Old people . So , that 's it for me . Project Manager : Alright . Nice , uh well { gap } show us . Industrial Designer : Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design . Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . And the materials ? Um I have heard several things , so I uh I 'll have to change that on the way . But uh the case ? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong . Marketing : Yeah , we should change that . Industrial Designer : It should feel strong . So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient . Project Manager : Well maybe it it it is , Industrial Designer : We should move to uh something { disfmarker } Project Manager : but it does n't look strong . So maybe { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Well yeah . Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it does n't have a really really tough look . So { disfmarker } Marketing : No no no . Project Manager : But we still have to look at our price of course . Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Also { disfmarker } Yeah . Mm-hmm . But we 'll return to that . Project Manager : Yeah ? Industrial Designer : Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . The chips made of silicon , I guess . I think that 's the best uh way to do it . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Then I 've uh { vocalsound } had a few findings , made a few findings . Uh the target audience product style . Um it 's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . But of course that 's not our uh things this . So this is things we must not do . Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , which is of course our uh group , the people we aim at . Um under forty five years old . Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . Marketing : Mm . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : But they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . And also they like curved round shapes . So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . But uh since we do n't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we do n't really have to consider that . Project Manager : Sports uh , they 're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh User Interface : Soccer fronts . { vocalsound } Mm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { disfmarker } Huh ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : That 's nice . { vocalsound } User Interface : Hmm . Project Manager : All the { gap } results ? Industrial Designer : Well I also have um several examples of uh styles , Marketing : We keep coming back to the fronts . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh { vocalsound } these are the basic uh older older peoples ' stuff . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : It was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } Nai . Uh no . Industrial Designer : but that 's n that 's not what we want . User Interface : Hmm . Industrial Designer : We have these kind of things . I do n't know what exactly they are . Marketing : { vocalsound } Fruity . { vocalsound } Fruity . Industrial Designer : It looks like { disfmarker } Well you know uh you recognise the shapes , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : it 's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : You also uh { vocalsound } see uh this device , it 's not very round and { disfmarker } Fruity of course . Yeah , it uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : It 's t terrible . Industrial Designer : That 's true . Project Manager : Alright . Industrial Designer : And uh well round shapes , primary colours . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : You can see it all here . And of course uh this famous device . Project Manager : Hmm ? Industrial Designer : I think as you know something uh some devices like this . Project Manager : Yeah , alright . Industrial Designer : So to give you an idea of uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Well it 's got a strong look , this . Yeah . Industrial Designer : This has a strong look . Although it 's plastic , it 's it 's grey to to to give it iron look . Marketing : Yeah , it still has a strong look . Project Manager : Yeah . And it 's round . Industrial Designer : That 's uh { disfmarker } Marketing : But then you are losing your fruity colours . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Well we have to make a { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . So uh those kind of things you can you can combine . Marketing : That 's true . Industrial Designer : Well we ca n't really make a round uh a round remote control . I do n't think that 's very practical , Project Manager : No , it is n't . Industrial Designer : but { disfmarker } But uh it 's important to to uh to think about the colour . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger . Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : 'Cause if you look at this , it it does n't look very very strong , Marketing : Yeah but the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : becau But this is plastic , and and this too , but { disfmarker } Marketing : But it does n't have to look strong . The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . Industrial Designer : The feel ? Uh alright . Marketing : The feel . Project Manager : So , if you ti Industrial Designer : Well { disfmarker } User Interface : And it it does n't have to be strong , also . Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : Nah yeah the feel { disfmarker } Project Manager : You you { disfmarker } Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . User Interface : { vocalsound } Only the feel . { vocalsound } Project Manager : So it it looks pretty but it feels strong . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Right . User Interface : Oh . Industrial Designer : And I { disfmarker } Then I have some more findings . Um { vocalsound } uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , Marketing : I agree . Industrial Designer : uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you do n't have a have a lot of uh sun . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote , Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : that 's a bit , oh , that 's a bit uh { disfmarker } That 's a bit uh much . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { gap } No titanium . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . That that 's the information I received . If you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you ca n't use titanium . Project Manager : What do you exactly mean with double curved ? Industrial Designer : Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look . User Interface : { gap } Industrial Designer : And uh { vocalsound } now the the shape , yeah , { gap } a curved case . Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . Uh { gap } a more modern look not plain , long box style , but { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } I dunno . Project Manager : Double curved ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I 'll draw it , Project Manager : It it mean { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah , well okay . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : but maybe later . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh { gap } . Um anyway { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . And , uh as we agreed , we do n't use a speaker or a sensor or um { vocalsound } uh speak uh speech uh controlled { vocalsound } device . Marketing : Yeah right . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . But { disfmarker } It 's worth the trouble I think , Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } User Interface : The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material . Industrial Designer : because { disfmarker } User Interface : Because people like that . Project Manager : This soft material thing from uh { disfmarker } Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh rubber is a soft material , I guess . User Interface : Yeah . Right . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh soft enough . Marketing : Yeah . Right . Industrial Designer : So that 's uh basically what I want to talk about . Project Manager : Alright . Okay . We will take that . And then uh Mike ? Okay . User Interface : Yeah . Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . Um we must decide where , this meeting . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , { vocalsound } um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . And um well they 're cheap , so we could use them now . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Oh { disfmarker } That 's interesting . User Interface : Um it 's not really speech recognition , it 's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that . Industrial Designer : Oh , yeah , I understand . Yeah . Marketing : Oh okay . { gap } Project Manager : Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . Marketing : Right . User Interface : No it does n't does not do anything . Marketing : No . Project Manager : Oh . That 's a bit uh { disfmarker } User Interface : But i it 's just a { disfmarker } Marketing : But that that makes it cheap . Project Manager : Yes . I understand . User Interface : Yeah it 's it 's cheap . Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : It 's { vocalsound } it 's just a an extra function , Project Manager : But { vocalsound } it has no functionality for our remote at all . Marketing : and it 's cheap . User Interface : No Marketing : No but { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : but that 's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks . Marketing : Yeah , right . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : But it it 's n nice for young people . Marketing : Young people love them . User Interface : Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . Um { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : They like gadgets . Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , ple Right . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : If it 's cheap . Yeah . User Interface : Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and { gap } uh and that kind of stuff { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . Project Manager : So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ? User Interface : I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . A voice recognition can be uh implemented . And uh I drew an example , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do . Marketing : { vocalsound } Alright . Industrial Designer : Can you draw it now of uh { disfmarker } Marketing : How { disfmarker } How { disfmarker } Project Manager : Ah . User Interface : Hmm ? Well I have the { disfmarker } I can draw it again , Industrial Designer : Can you draw it now ? User Interface : and I know what I did wrong . I did n't tick the note bo box in the { gap } . Um { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm . Alright . Marketing : How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the { disfmarker } Marketing : Alright . So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down . Project Manager : But then we should also have an uh an Okay button . User Interface : Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . Yes . Marketing : Yeah right . User Interface : { vocalsound } Um I shall draw this . If it uh works . Industrial Designer : { gap } button , yeah . Project Manager : Just uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } There is already a blank . Yes ? So { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : Mm so have I . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Nah . Marketing : { gap } . { gap } You have to push hard . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { gap } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I suggest a banana shape . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Because of the fruity uh fashion . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : No m Next year that 's out . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yellow and { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah alright , yeah . Just a hunch . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? User Interface : Yeah just uh the numbers . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? User Interface : These these will be bigger in the the real design . Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Alright , yeah . User Interface : This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . User Interface : And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : and that can Um the video button should be uh an apart button , Marketing : You 've { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : And what 's the menu button ? User Interface : Um it 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : And you you need a you need a speaker . User Interface : Hmm ? Marketing : For the { disfmarker } { gap } User Interface : This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : But how did { disfmarker } How do you get out of the menu then ? Yeah . User Interface : Well we we can add another button here , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . Uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . By pressing the menu button again , you go uh out . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : It 's usual the the the d kind of the way it works . Project Manager : Yes , well but bec because when you { vocalsound } push Menu you get in , Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Yeah ? Project Manager : and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice . User Interface : Ah right . Well you you { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . But you can men you can press menu again to get out . Project Manager : Well that 's also the Okay button . That 's you you should have uh { disfmarker } User Interface : No no , we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button Industrial Designer : No . Project Manager : Or you can put in the L_C_D_ 's uh window an option Get Out . User Interface : and this the Okay button . Marketing : Exit . Project Manager : Exit { gap } . User Interface : Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you do n't need that that extra option . Project Manager : Well , it 's just a choice . User Interface : You have uh redundancy . Marketing : But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . User Interface : Yeah , Industrial Designer : { gap } Marketing : Or do n't { disfmarker } User Interface : if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should . Industrial Designer : Why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ? User Interface : Well they that could be anywhere . Industrial Designer : Where would you put it ? User Interface : That 's very small . It could be uh down here . { vocalsound } Um . Well , not here . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . User Interface : I { vocalsound } yeah I suggest here . But that 's just a little { vocalsound } gap . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Microphone , yeah . Marketing : Right , and spea speaker at the back , or something . User Interface : Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah I understand . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Alright . Industrial Designer : Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it 's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something . User Interface : Well i Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they wo n't be uh very expensive . But { disfmarker } Project Manager : Huh ? Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : Yeah ? Okay . User Interface : This is my suggested design . Project Manager : Well , okay , alright . Um then let 's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Yes . And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . Project Manager : I 'd { disfmarker } I agree . User Interface : { vocalsound } But { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , fine . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Fine . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well yeah yeah yeah . Marketing : Move on . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Oh , um I had some uh examples . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I can live with it . Project Manager : Yes ? User Interface : You can uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } But { disfmarker } I did not like it very much , but { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Well these are quite obvious , very ugly remote . { vocalsound } Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Too big . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : They do they do n't look fruity enough . User Interface : No , well th Marketing : { vocalsound } Nei They 're n they 're not trendy . Project Manager : They 're all black . User Interface : Yeah . Well not all . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Hey , that one I like . { vocalsound } User Interface : Uh this is for children but { vocalsound } th Industrial Designer : Tho Yeah those { disfmarker } Marketing : It does n't look strong . { vocalsound } Project Manager : No . User Interface : { vocalsound } No . Industrial Designer : But it does n't uh the { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } The remote . { vocalsound } User Interface : W but with the colours i it 's a bit the way we 're going to . Industrial Designer : Yeah , ok Yeah . Marketing : Yeah right . User Interface : Well this is a terrible { disfmarker } Project Manager : Terrible . Marketing : This is just crazy . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } But it it must not look too childish of course huh ? Project Manager : It 's it 's all too much buttons . User Interface : Um this looks { disfmarker } Project Manager : Too many buttons . That 's { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens . I think we should , if it 's um possible , uh one with colours , but { disfmarker } Marketing : Nah th It 's too expensive . User Interface : I do n't know uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well , that 's too expensive I think . User Interface : Too expensive ? Alright . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Alright . Yeah . User Interface : Well { disfmarker } Nah . Industrial Designer : But it { disfmarker } Yeah . { gap } Project Manager : Okay . Huh . User Interface : Ha , even more . N Project Manager : Mm no . { vocalsound } 'Kay . Marketing : But are we going for a strange uh form ? Project Manager : No , not very strange . Marketing : 'Cause people like that . Industrial Designer : Not not too strange . No . Marketing : Not too strange . Project Manager : It still has t Marketing : You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is . Project Manager : Yes . Th a a kind of bridge . So it f falls over the hand . User Interface : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms , s something like that . Project Manager : Yeah ? Yeah ? Yeah . Marketing : You know ? { gap } Project Manager : Well I have at home { vocalsound } a remote with a bridge . It 's just a half round half half circle at { disfmarker } And then it falls exactly over the hand , and that 's very nice . That 's { disfmarker } It feels comfortable . Marketing : Yeah , but people like something uh new you know . Industrial Designer : Exotic yeah . Marketing : Yeah , different . Industrial Designer : We have t Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I will design it , we design it later . Marketing : Y yis Industrial Designer : So we 'll get to that later I guess . Marketing : Alright . Great . Project Manager : Yeah , alright . Um where did I put it ? Um conceptual phase , I think this is it . Industrial Designer : The specific shape . The { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : I got this from our friends . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Uh yeah the conceptual design . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Our sources . Project Manager : These are a few examples which we have to decide about . All the the materials from the case , uh the electric cable that 's all your uh your side of the story . Um { disfmarker } Marketing : Your bag . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Um now from the user interface , your uh package ? { vocalsound } Um where { disfmarker } No well , that 's more like the buttons where they have to come . And um { disfmarker } B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of uh design . User Interface : Yeah , this is what we 've just done . Right ? Project Manager : Yes , but we have to decide about these now . Industrial Designer : But uh we should decide now . User Interface : Ah right . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : And uh the trend-watching . Marketing : Materials are the most , most impor Project Manager : So as you said , fruity is in , well { gap } sells good . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Wow . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Uh these things . Industrial Designer : So we have to uh put it in one uh document . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh yes . Um so if we uh go through them { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document , and then uh put the answers after the subjects . { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Not everything . Industrial Designer : Well we have to decide all these things ? User Interface : Yeah but { vocalsound } all these examples are uh of a coffee machine . Project Manager : Yeah well uh { disfmarker } Why should I uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : W we can uh override them ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Well a case ? Uh that 's me . Uh I suggest { disfmarker } Well what do I suggest actually ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : What what kind of properties should it have ? Well we just listened . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Uh s solid , User Interface : I think we { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : yeah . Yeah . User Interface : Why do n't we um use uh titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front . Marketing : Do you know the new uh { disfmarker } User Interface : That { disfmarker } Just like um most cell phones are . Industrial Designer : Yeah , I understand . Marketing : No { vocalsound } no { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . So we have titanium . { vocalsound } Marketing : The front is the most important . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : to give that uh strong look . Project Manager : You know what ? Industrial Designer : And then the front is made of plastic . And you can put that on and off , and switch it . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : But the feel of plastic is n't strong . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No but you have titanium of course . User Interface : No but you you have this { disfmarker } Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh you have the best of both worlds . Marketing : Yeah alright , alright . 'Kay . User Interface : Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this . So you feel titanium . { gap } Industrial Designer : And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end . But you also have the titanium . Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Fronts are are cheaper than when they 're from plas User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah of course , but yeah { vocalsound } you have to make a decision . User Interface : And I do n't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to . Marketing : Yeah , but it it 's expensive . Industrial Designer : I guess so . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh titanium I sh I think uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Bendable . Industrial Designer : Huh ? Well , well the { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Bendable . User Interface : Well any colour { gap } { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : According to my sources , uh it 's it 's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh { disfmarker } Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want . User Interface : Yeah , then you you paint it in the colour you want it . The plastic is is the colour you want it . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Yeah . Paint spray . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Yeah alright . User Interface : So { gap } { disfmarker } Yeah . Project Manager : Alright . Marketing : So , we 're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ? Project Manager : I 've uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , Project Manager : Titanium back , plastic front . Industrial Designer : I think that 's a nice trade-off . Project Manager : Okay . Um well I am going to put it in here , uh because we can uh look . Marketing : Yeah , great . Project Manager : I { disfmarker } Um solid feel and trendy look . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Alright . Project Manager : So material , um hard plastic for the front ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : For the non-removable uh part . Marketing : But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you ca n't switch it . When you want an other colour on the front , it does n't match . User Interface : Well titanium is neutral . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : You know ? Industrial Designer : The titan titanium is n't is n't v very { disfmarker } Yeah , i it does n't uh { vocalsound } curves . Marketing : { vocalsound } I understand .

Industrial Designer : I dunno if if you disagree , Marketing : Alright . User Interface : Well { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : but I think it 's does n't matter very much . User Interface : Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours , Marketing : Yeah . Alright . User Interface : and they do n't use uh wood . Marketing : { vocalsound } Funky customers .

Project Manager : Oh we can uh decide how we implement { vocalsound } the feeling from our company into the remote . User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : Well yeah . Um I think um { vocalsound } a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be { disfmarker } Project Manager : Also the slogan ? On the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , why not ? { vocalsound } If there 's enough space , { vocalsound } you can put uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Uh I I 'd say only the logo . Industrial Designer : We 'll we 'll { disfmarker } Marketing : O Yeah . Me too . User Interface : Too much text and it gets too too busy . Industrial Designer : Well , our slogan is not very long . It 's just a simple { disfmarker } Project Manager : We put the fashion in electronics . User Interface : Well { vocalsound } it 's quite a long phrase . Industrial Designer : What is it ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : We put the fashion in electronics . Marketing : But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts . So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } You c { vocalsound } But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part . The logo and the and the { disfmarker } User Interface : Ah the logo should be on the top I think . Marketing : Yeah , right . The logo { disfmarker } Project Manager : On the top . Yeah . Well in in in the right top corner ? Industrial Designer : Yeah they do . Well yeah . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Right corner , yes .

User Interface : { gap } uh the text ? Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Just just small . User Interface : Uh yeah , at the back ? Marketing : But the logo the logo should n't be exchangeable , when you get off the front . User Interface : Well you c Well uh { disfmarker } Yes . Industrial Designer : Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board , Project Manager : Yeah well { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Yeah . User Interface : You can { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : and you can remove the front . User Interface : The logo can be on on every uh front .

Project Manager : Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo Industrial Designer : But we 'll uh we 'll take that uh with us into the design . User Interface : Yeah I think over here the logo . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Lo Uh yeah . Or maybe here in the middle , but we 'll decide later . Project Manager : and logo also on the front but not exchange uh { disfmarker } Uh ? Hmm ? { vocalsound } { gap } Uh when changing fronts .

Project Manager : Five minutes left . Industrial Designer : Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium , User Interface : Yes we could { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { gap } the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen .

Project Manager : Yeah . Let 's go . User Interface : Well { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Finish meeting now . Project Manager : Finish the meeting now . Alright now we know what to do , so User Interface : We 'll stay here ? Project Manager : Um { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Oh . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Message ? User Interface : Or we 'll get the email . Industrial Designer : Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here ? Project Manager : No , get away . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Huh ? Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Guess so . Project Manager : Um I I 'm not sure . Maybe you { disfmarker } Yeah . Well you 'll have to work on this one . User Interface : Well we 'll wait a few seconds Project Manager : Yeah . That 's a good idea . User Interface : and then we 'll get an email . Marketing : Alright . Have fun lads . Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } A happy hol happy holidays . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Good luck . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } but you can scratch it off or something . It 's better if you have it uh { disfmarker } 
Query : What is Marketing 's presentation mainly about ? Marketing : Right . I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do . Project Manager : 'Kay . Marketing : Uh the trends . { vocalsound } It 's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling . Uh this because of our last model was very functional , but { vocalsound } it uh people did n't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . That 's uh something you uh have to take a look at . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Alright . Marketing : And uh the feeling has to be very great . Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great . Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : Um there 's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . This is uh two times as less important , Project Manager : Less . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : and uh same for this one . { vocalsound } Um , technological technological innovations , that 's uh regarded very highly too . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier . Project Manager : Well , yeah . Marketing : So we have to have uh something like that , like we uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts . Marketing : Right . { vocalsound } Uh the last point is easy to use . Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . I do n't know who 's uh who 's going to look at that . Industrial Designer : Easy to use ? Project Manager : Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah ? Industrial Designer : I think that 's your ta User Interface : { gap } Project Manager : Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . Marketing : Yeah , I know . Project Manager : Well we have to choose one of them . { vocalsound } Marketing : I think we have to go for the first one . Project Manager : Yeah . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : It 's the most important one . So { gap } we have to uh take that one . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : So it it { vocalsound } it is n't very important that { vocalsound } that it works easy . User Interface : Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } But { vocalsound } it has to look great . Project Manager : Yeah . We 'll we 'll look at uh { gap } . Industrial Designer : You { disfmarker } Yeah . Yeah , yeah , Marketing : We 'll see . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use { disfmarker } { vocalsound } It 's not a very comp complicated device . Marketing : Yeah , right . But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say { gap } wow , that 's real great uh great concept . Project Manager : 'Kay . Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : Alright . Uh these are the new colours of this year . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : So it must be very bright , very colourful . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : People like this . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : So we we have to think uh in this direction . Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Marketing : So i set your mind to it . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : Findings ? Fashion update ? Fruit and vegetables are cool . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Uh you think ? Marketing : I am told . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : So { vocalsound } we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah , well { disfmarker } User Interface : Bananas . Marketing : Uh furthermore uh material , that 's your part , should be very strong . I was thinking of something like uh { vocalsound } well uh iron plate over it , Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : maybe in a colour or something , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong . Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : B Marketing : And that 's uh also for the younger public . Project Manager : Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . Th this year it 's fruits but next year it 's it 's something totally different . Marketing : Yeah , that 's great . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin . Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily . Project Manager : Yep , alright . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Well , the don'ts . Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . Well we do n't want uh older people , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : we want young people . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { gap } Marketing : So uh we 're gon na turn that around . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : We 're gon na have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours . Right ? Project Manager : Wood is popular . Aha . Marketing : Okay . We do n't want wood . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah yeah yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah , among the old people , yeah . Marketing : Old people . So , that 's it for me . Project Manager : Alright . Nice , uh well { gap } show us . 
Query : What is Industrial Designer 's presentation mainly about ? Industrial Designer : Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design . Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . And the materials ? Um I have heard several things , so I uh I 'll have to change that on the way . But uh the case ? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong . Marketing : Yeah , we should change that . Industrial Designer : It should feel strong . So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient . Project Manager : Well maybe it it it is , Industrial Designer : We should move to uh something { disfmarker } Project Manager : but it does n't look strong . So maybe { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Well yeah . Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it does n't have a really really tough look . So { disfmarker } Marketing : No no no . Project Manager : But we still have to look at our price of course . Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Also { disfmarker } Yeah . Mm-hmm . But we 'll return to that . Project Manager : Yeah ? Industrial Designer : Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . The chips made of silicon , I guess . I think that 's the best uh way to do it . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Then I 've uh { vocalsound } had a few findings , made a few findings . Uh the target audience product style . Um it 's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . But of course that 's not our uh things this . So this is things we must not do . Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , which is of course our uh group , the people we aim at . Um under forty five years old . Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours . Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . Marketing : Mm . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : But they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . And also they like curved round shapes . So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . But uh since we do n't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we do n't really have to consider that . Project Manager : Sports uh , they 're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh User Interface : Soccer fronts . { vocalsound } Mm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { disfmarker } Huh ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : That 's nice . { vocalsound } User Interface : Hmm . Project Manager : All the { gap } results ? Industrial Designer : Well I also have um several examples of uh styles , Marketing : We keep coming back to the fronts . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh { vocalsound } these are the basic uh older older peoples ' stuff . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : It was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } Nai . Uh no . Industrial Designer : but that 's n that 's not what we want . User Interface : Hmm . Industrial Designer : We have these kind of things . I do n't know what exactly they are . Marketing : { vocalsound } Fruity . { vocalsound } Fruity . Industrial Designer : It looks like { disfmarker } Well you know uh you recognise the shapes , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : it 's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : You also uh { vocalsound } see uh this device , it 's not very round and { disfmarker } Fruity of course . Yeah , it uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : It 's t terrible . Industrial Designer : That 's true . Project Manager : Alright . Industrial Designer : And uh well round shapes , primary colours . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : You can see it all here . And of course uh this famous device . Project Manager : Hmm ? Industrial Designer : I think as you know something uh some devices like this . Project Manager : Yeah , alright . Industrial Designer : So to give you an idea of uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Well it 's got a strong look , this . Yeah . Industrial Designer : This has a strong look . Although it 's plastic , it 's it 's grey to to to give it iron look . Marketing : Yeah , it still has a strong look . Project Manager : Yeah . And it 's round . Industrial Designer : That 's uh { disfmarker } Marketing : But then you are losing your fruity colours . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Well we have to make a { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . So uh those kind of things you can you can combine . Marketing : That 's true . Industrial Designer : Well we ca n't really make a round uh a round remote control . I do n't think that 's very practical , Project Manager : No , it is n't . Industrial Designer : but { disfmarker } But uh it 's important to to uh to think about the colour . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger . Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : 'Cause if you look at this , it it does n't look very very strong , Marketing : Yeah but the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : becau But this is plastic , and and this too , but { disfmarker } Marketing : But it does n't have to look strong . The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . Industrial Designer : The feel ? Uh alright . Marketing : The feel . Project Manager : So , if you ti Industrial Designer : Well { disfmarker } User Interface : And it it does n't have to be strong , also . Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : Nah yeah the feel { disfmarker } Project Manager : You you { disfmarker } Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . User Interface : { vocalsound } Only the feel . { vocalsound } Project Manager : So it it looks pretty but it feels strong . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Right . User Interface : Oh . Industrial Designer : And I { disfmarker } Then I have some more findings . Um { vocalsound } uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , Marketing : I agree . Industrial Designer : uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you do n't have a have a lot of uh sun . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote , Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : that 's a bit , oh , that 's a bit uh { disfmarker } That 's a bit uh much . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { gap } No titanium . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . That that 's the information I received . If you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you ca n't use titanium . Project Manager : What do you exactly mean with double curved ? Industrial Designer : Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look . User Interface : { gap } Industrial Designer : And uh { vocalsound } now the the shape , yeah , { gap } a curved case . Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . Uh { gap } a more modern look not plain , long box style , but { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } I dunno . Project Manager : Double curved ? Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } I 'll draw it , Project Manager : It it mean { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah , well okay . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : but maybe later . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh { gap } . Um anyway { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . And , uh as we agreed , we do n't use a speaker or a sensor or um { vocalsound } uh speak uh speech uh controlled { vocalsound } device . Marketing : Yeah right . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . But { disfmarker } It 's worth the trouble I think , Project Manager : Well { disfmarker } User Interface : The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material . Industrial Designer : because { disfmarker } User Interface : Because people like that . Project Manager : This soft material thing from uh { disfmarker } Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh rubber is a soft material , I guess . User Interface : Yeah . Right . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh soft enough . Marketing : Yeah . Right . Industrial Designer : So that 's uh basically what I want to talk about . Project Manager : Alright . Okay . We will take that . And then uh Mike ? Okay . 
Query : What is User Interface 's presentation mainly about ? User Interface : Yeah . Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier . Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . Um we must decide where , this meeting . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , { vocalsound } um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . And um well they 're cheap , so we could use them now . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Oh { disfmarker } That 's interesting . User Interface : Um it 's not really speech recognition , it 's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that . Industrial Designer : Oh , yeah , I understand . Yeah . Marketing : Oh okay . { gap } Project Manager : Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . Marketing : Right . User Interface : No it does n't does not do anything . Marketing : No . Project Manager : Oh . That 's a bit uh { disfmarker } User Interface : But i it 's just a { disfmarker } Marketing : But that that makes it cheap . Project Manager : Yes . I understand . User Interface : Yeah it 's it 's cheap . Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : It 's { vocalsound } it 's just a an extra function , Project Manager : But { vocalsound } it has no functionality for our remote at all . Marketing : and it 's cheap . User Interface : No Marketing : No but { vocalsound } { disfmarker } User Interface : but that 's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks . Marketing : Yeah , right . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : But it it 's n nice for young people . Marketing : Young people love them . User Interface : Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . Um { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : They like gadgets . Yeah . Marketing : Yeah , ple Right . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : If it 's cheap . Yeah . User Interface : Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and { gap } uh and that kind of stuff { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . Project Manager : So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ? User Interface : I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that . Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . A voice recognition can be uh implemented . And uh I drew an example , Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do . Marketing : { vocalsound } Alright . Industrial Designer : Can you draw it now of uh { disfmarker } Marketing : How { disfmarker } How { disfmarker } Project Manager : Ah . User Interface : Hmm ? Well I have the { disfmarker } I can draw it again , Industrial Designer : Can you draw it now ? User Interface : and I know what I did wrong . I did n't tick the note bo box in the { gap } . Um { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Mm . Alright . Marketing : How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the { disfmarker } Marketing : Alright . So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down . Project Manager : But then we should also have an uh an Okay button . User Interface : Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . Yes . Marketing : Yeah right . User Interface : { vocalsound } Um I shall draw this . If it uh works . Industrial Designer : { gap } button , yeah . Project Manager : Just uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } There is already a blank . Yes ? So { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : Mm so have I . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Nah . Marketing : { gap } . { gap } You have to push hard . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { gap } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I suggest a banana shape . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Because of the fruity uh fashion . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : No m Next year that 's out . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yellow and { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah alright , yeah . Just a hunch . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh correct . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ? User Interface : Yeah just uh the numbers . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? User Interface : These these will be bigger in the the real design . Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Alright , yeah . User Interface : This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . User Interface : And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : and that can Um the video button should be uh an apart button , Marketing : You 've { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click . Marketing : Right . Project Manager : And what 's the menu button ? User Interface : Um it 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : And you you need a you need a speaker . User Interface : Hmm ? Marketing : For the { disfmarker } { gap } User Interface : This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : But how did { disfmarker } How do you get out of the menu then ? Yeah . User Interface : Well we we can add another button here , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . Uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . By pressing the menu button again , you go uh out . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : It 's usual the the the d kind of the way it works . Project Manager : Yes , well but bec because when you { vocalsound } push Menu you get in , Industrial Designer : Yeah ? Yeah ? Project Manager : and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice . User Interface : Ah right . Well you you { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . But you can men you can press menu again to get out . Project Manager : Well that 's also the Okay button . That 's you you should have uh { disfmarker } User Interface : No no , we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button Industrial Designer : No . Project Manager : Or you can put in the L_C_D_ 's uh window an option Get Out . User Interface : and this the Okay button . Marketing : Exit . Project Manager : Exit { gap } . User Interface : Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you do n't need that that extra option . Project Manager : Well , it 's just a choice . User Interface : You have uh redundancy . Marketing : But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . User Interface : Yeah , Industrial Designer : { gap } Marketing : Or do n't { disfmarker } User Interface : if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should . Industrial Designer : Why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ? User Interface : Well they that could be anywhere . Industrial Designer : Where would you put it ? User Interface : That 's very small . It could be uh down here . { vocalsound } Um . Well , not here . Industrial Designer : Uh-huh . User Interface : I { vocalsound } yeah I suggest here . But that 's just a little { vocalsound } gap . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Microphone , yeah . Marketing : Right , and spea speaker at the back , or something . User Interface : Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah I understand . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Alright . Industrial Designer : Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it 's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something . User Interface : Well i Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they wo n't be uh very expensive . But { disfmarker } Project Manager : Huh ? Industrial Designer : Alright . Marketing : Alright . Project Manager : Yeah ? Okay . User Interface : This is my suggested design . 
Query : What are the group 's decisions on LSD screen , color and materials ? Project Manager : Well , okay , alright . Um then let 's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . User Interface : Um { disfmarker } Yes . And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . Project Manager : I 'd { disfmarker } I agree . User Interface : { vocalsound } But { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , fine . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Fine . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well yeah yeah yeah . Marketing : Move on . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Oh , um I had some uh examples . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : I can live with it . Project Manager : Yes ? User Interface : You can uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } But { disfmarker } I did not like it very much , but { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Well these are quite obvious , very ugly remote . { vocalsound } Um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Too big . { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : They do they do n't look fruity enough . User Interface : No , well th Marketing : { vocalsound } Nei They 're n they 're not trendy . Project Manager : They 're all black . User Interface : Yeah . Well not all . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Hey , that one I like . { vocalsound } User Interface : Uh this is for children but { vocalsound } th Industrial Designer : Tho Yeah those { disfmarker } Marketing : It does n't look strong . { vocalsound } Project Manager : No . User Interface : { vocalsound } No . Industrial Designer : But it does n't uh the { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } The remote . { vocalsound } User Interface : W but with the colours i it 's a bit the way we 're going to . Industrial Designer : Yeah , ok Yeah . Marketing : Yeah right . User Interface : Well this is a terrible { disfmarker } Project Manager : Terrible . Marketing : This is just crazy . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } But it it must not look too childish of course huh ? Project Manager : It 's it 's all too much buttons . User Interface : Um this looks { disfmarker } Project Manager : Too many buttons . That 's { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens . I think we should , if it 's um possible , uh one with colours , but { disfmarker } Marketing : Nah th It 's too expensive . User Interface : I do n't know uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well , that 's too expensive I think . User Interface : Too expensive ? Alright . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Alright . Yeah . User Interface : Well { disfmarker } Nah . Industrial Designer : But it { disfmarker } Yeah . { gap } Project Manager : Okay . Huh . User Interface : Ha , even more . N Project Manager : Mm no . { vocalsound } 'Kay . Marketing : But are we going for a strange uh form ? Project Manager : No , not very strange . Marketing : 'Cause people like that . Industrial Designer : Not not too strange . No . Marketing : Not too strange . Project Manager : It still has t Marketing : You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is . Project Manager : Yes . Th a a kind of bridge . So it f falls over the hand . User Interface : Well { disfmarker } Marketing : I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms , s something like that . Project Manager : Yeah ? Yeah ? Yeah . Marketing : You know ? { gap } Project Manager : Well I have at home { vocalsound } a remote with a bridge . It 's just a half round half half circle at { disfmarker } And then it falls exactly over the hand , and that 's very nice . That 's { disfmarker } It feels comfortable . Marketing : Yeah , but people like something uh new you know . Industrial Designer : Exotic yeah . Marketing : Yeah , different . Industrial Designer : We have t Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I will design it , we design it later . Marketing : Y yis Industrial Designer : So we 'll get to that later I guess . Marketing : Alright . Great . Project Manager : Yeah , alright . Um where did I put it ? Um conceptual phase , I think this is it . Industrial Designer : The specific shape . The { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : I got this from our friends . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Uh yeah the conceptual design . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Our sources . Project Manager : These are a few examples which we have to decide about . All the the materials from the case , uh the electric cable that 's all your uh your side of the story . Um { disfmarker } Marketing : Your bag . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Um now from the user interface , your uh package ? { vocalsound } Um where { disfmarker } No well , that 's more like the buttons where they have to come . And um { disfmarker } B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of uh design . User Interface : Yeah , this is what we 've just done . Right ? Project Manager : Yes , but we have to decide about these now . Industrial Designer : But uh we should decide now . User Interface : Ah right . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : And uh the trend-watching . Marketing : Materials are the most , most impor Project Manager : So as you said , fruity is in , well { gap } sells good . User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Wow . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Uh these things . Industrial Designer : So we have to uh put it in one uh document . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh yes . Um so if we uh go through them { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document , and then uh put the answers after the subjects . { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Not everything . Industrial Designer : Well we have to decide all these things ? User Interface : Yeah but { vocalsound } all these examples are uh of a coffee machine . Project Manager : Yeah well uh { disfmarker } Why should I uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : W we can uh override them ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : So { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Well a case ? Uh that 's me . Uh I suggest { disfmarker } Well what do I suggest actually ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : What what kind of properties should it have ? Well we just listened . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Uh s solid , User Interface : I think we { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : yeah . Yeah . User Interface : Why do n't we um use uh titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front . Marketing : Do you know the new uh { disfmarker } User Interface : That { disfmarker } Just like um most cell phones are . Industrial Designer : Yeah , I understand . Marketing : No { vocalsound } no { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . So we have titanium . { vocalsound } Marketing : The front is the most important . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : to give that uh strong look . Project Manager : You know what ? Industrial Designer : And then the front is made of plastic . And you can put that on and off , and switch it . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : But the feel of plastic is n't strong . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No but you have titanium of course . User Interface : No but you you have this { disfmarker } Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh you have the best of both worlds . Marketing : Yeah alright , alright . 'Kay . User Interface : Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this . So you feel titanium . { gap } Industrial Designer : And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end . But you also have the titanium . Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Fronts are are cheaper than when they 're from plas User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah of course , but yeah { vocalsound } you have to make a decision . User Interface : And I do n't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to . Marketing : Yeah , but it it 's expensive . Industrial Designer : I guess so . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh titanium I sh I think uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Bendable . Industrial Designer : Huh ? Well , well the { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Bendable . User Interface : Well any colour { gap } { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : According to my sources , uh it 's it 's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh { disfmarker } Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want . User Interface : Yeah , then you you paint it in the colour you want it . The plastic is is the colour you want it . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Yeah . Paint spray . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : Yeah alright . User Interface : So { gap } { disfmarker } Yeah . Project Manager : Alright . Marketing : So , we 're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ? Project Manager : I 've uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , Project Manager : Titanium back , plastic front . Industrial Designer : I think that 's a nice trade-off . Project Manager : Okay . Um well I am going to put it in here , uh because we can uh look . Marketing : Yeah , great . Project Manager : I { disfmarker } Um solid feel and trendy look . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Alright . Project Manager : So material , um hard plastic for the front ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : For the non-removable uh part . Marketing : But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you ca n't switch it . When you want an other colour on the front , it does n't match . User Interface : Well titanium is neutral . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : You know ? Industrial Designer : The titan titanium is n't is n't v very { disfmarker } Yeah , i it does n't uh { vocalsound } curves . Marketing : { vocalsound } I understand . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } No uh I nei . { vocalsound } Titanium is very { disfmarker } No no no , but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , Marketing : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah . User Interface : Hmm . Industrial Designer : and it does n't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I dunno if if you disagree , Marketing : Alright . User Interface : Well { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : but I think it 's does n't matter very much . User Interface : Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours , Marketing : Yeah . Alright . User Interface : and they do n't use uh wood . Marketing : { vocalsound } Funky customers . Industrial Designer : And even if it does uh does n't match , it will uh { disfmarker } People like mm colours that do n't match . User Interface : Mm . Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . And well Marketing : Alright . { vocalsound } Project Manager : the the electrical cable is just normal uh { gap } . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Cop copper uh material . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Excuse me ? Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : The electrical cable uh does { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : It 's uh from uh our coffee uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh { disfmarker } User Interface : No we do n't use an electrical cable . Project Manager : { gap } { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah inside , but this is for the coffee uh machine . Industrial Designer : Yeah in { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Of course . User Interface : Yeah , but that 's not what 's meant here , I think . { vocalsound } Marketing : Nei . Industrial Designer : { gap } Marketing : So external . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Oh external ? User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Well { gap } { vocalsound } A coffee grind does n't have { disfmarker } Na ja . Never mind the coffee grind . Project Manager : Well uh Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard work . So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Right ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : The chip is normal silicon . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh the buttons are normal , etcetera . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay ? So that 's just easy . Industrial Designer : Alright . Mm-hmm . Project Manager : Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our { vocalsound } earlier uh remotes . The conceptual specification of the user interface ? Um well we have our beautiful drawing . User Interface : Well I got a better one here Marketing : { vocalsound } Alright . User Interface : and I will um { disfmarker } Project Manager : Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder , User Interface : The shared folder . Project Manager : and then I 'll put it in our end report . User Interface : I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting . Project Manager : Yes , you can { disfmarker } Mm yeah . You can uh put some uh which button is what . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . Um User Interface : Yeah yeah yeah . Project Manager : the trend-watching { disfmarker } { gap } included these days . And what do we ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : We thing that fruit and bright colours are { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah the the the front w Marketing : I think we can launch a couple of packages . You can buy a different kind of of of machine , User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : but it 's the same thing , but with another front . Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot . Marketing : So { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah that 's the whole idea of the front . Marketing : And you can you can { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . User Interface : Yes . Project Manager : Uh those kind of things . Marketing : Yeah right . User Interface : But that 's for later on . The fronts y you can do anything with them . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like iPod mini { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah , right { disfmarker } For the uh initiative uh launch . Marketing : Yeah . Industrial Designer : For the for the launch , yeah . User Interface : Mm . Marketing : It 's good marketing . Project Manager : Launch different lines at once . Industrial Designer : So e th then a c couple of basic colours . Not not very uh { vocalsound } sim Not { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah , n not too heavy . You can always take another pick . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time . Marketing : { vocalsound } They have to buy it later on . User Interface : Oh yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . { gap } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah right . User Interface : { vocalsound } Yeah . Yeah . Project Manager : Come on . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } More basic . Project Manager : We still have to make those fifty million , yeah ? { vocalsound } . Industrial Designer : Very boring , yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } User Interface : Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so , Industrial Designer : The most boring fronts possible . Project Manager : The most ugly . User Interface : so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more . Marketing : Yeah , right . Project Manager : Two . Industrial Designer : Yeah but you you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them , Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Red red , blue and green you give them or something , Industrial Designer : and and uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : and then you can give them { gap } uh other ones . Industrial Designer : And uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Alright . Um well the buttons etcetera , we get from Mike . Uh this fruit and bright colours , yeah well I think we 'll have to in the next uh half an hour , we 'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch , when we uh { vocalsound } well introduce our remote . Industrial Designer : Uh we still have to make { disfmarker } We have still have to make the es the the real basic design . { vocalsound } Because yeah we have the sketch but { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . But we we must remember that { vocalsound } fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing . Project Manager : Yes . Marketing : Else it w wo n't sell . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : So { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yes . Industrial Designer : Alright , yeah . Project Manager : Well I 'll have to , before I get another warning for five minutes , I 'm going to get { disfmarker } Where is my mouse ? Uh where is my mouse ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Lost my mouse . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Oh yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Um this is it . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Unbelievable . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well , um this we have . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Uh basic stuff . Interface we have . Supplements , L_C_D_ . Maybe a a cheap voice recording . Well { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah we should do that . Industrial Designer : The price ? Project Manager : Yes . Alright . Individual actions . Industrial Designer : We all agree on that . Yeah . User Interface : Mm . Project Manager : Industry designer , { gap } . User Interface , Mike . You 're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . User Interface : Yeah , we can do that . Industrial Designer : Together or uh { disfmarker } Yeah together . Marketing : Yeah togeth { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } That 's what I got uh to hear . Industrial Designer : How { disfmarker } Yeah yeah , but how do I { disfmarker } User Interface : But bu we stay we stay here or something ? Project Manager : Yes well we 'll get it to hear that I think . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : But I think so . Th they 're saying SMARTboard and that 's it { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } You can take the SMARTboard . { vocalsound } Project Manager : This is the SMARTboard , so { disfmarker } User Interface : Ah right . { vocalsound } And take it to our rooms and uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype , and y Well that 's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera . User Interface : Ah , specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . So you 'll get it on your em on your laptop . Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Some { disfmarker } Some non functional tasks . Marketing : { vocalsound } Have fun { vocalsound } . Project Manager : yeah project evaluation . So um { disfmarker } Marketing : 'Kay . Project Manager : { gap } , what are you going to do ? Uh I do n't know what product evaluation exactly means , but uh you 'll get uh the specifications . Marketing : We do n't have produ product yet , Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : so kind of difficult . { vocalsound } Project Manager : That 's why I uh { disfmarker } But uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } You 're fired . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : How long do we still have ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Well , can we talk about something else ? Uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . { gap } Industrial Designer : Uh no I do n't know anything , but maybe uh anyone else uh { disfmarker } 
Query : What does the group discuss on the final decision of the company sign ? Project Manager : Oh we can uh decide how we implement { vocalsound } the feeling from our company into the remote . User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : Well yeah . Um I think um { vocalsound } a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be { disfmarker } Project Manager : Also the slogan ? On the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , why not ? { vocalsound } If there 's enough space , { vocalsound } you can put uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Uh I I 'd say only the logo . Industrial Designer : We 'll we 'll { disfmarker } Marketing : O Yeah . Me too . User Interface : Too much text and it gets too too busy . Industrial Designer : Well , our slogan is not very long . It 's just a simple { disfmarker } Project Manager : We put the fashion in electronics . User Interface : Well { vocalsound } it 's quite a long phrase . Industrial Designer : What is it ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : We put the fashion in electronics . Marketing : But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts . So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } You c { vocalsound } But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part . The logo and the and the { disfmarker } User Interface : Ah the logo should be on the top I think . Marketing : Yeah , right . The logo { disfmarker } Project Manager : On the top . Yeah . Well in in in the right top corner ? Industrial Designer : Yeah they do . Well yeah . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Right corner , yes . Project Manager : And well you c On the back , you can put uh h { vocalsound } At the bottom , you can put the logo with the { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Right corner , or maybe here in the middle ? User Interface : { gap } uh the text ? Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Project Manager : Just just small . User Interface : Uh yeah , at the back ? Marketing : But the logo the logo should n't be exchangeable , when you get off the front . User Interface : Well you c Well uh { disfmarker } Yes . Industrial Designer : Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board , Project Manager : Yeah well { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . { vocalsound } Yeah . User Interface : You can { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : and you can remove the front . User Interface : The logo can be on on every uh front . Marketing : Yeah , User Interface : Yeah , but then you must uh really uh yeah { vocalsound } push it in or something . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Carved into the material . { vocalsound } No , you you can carve it into the titanium at the back . Industrial Designer : I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing . User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : But { vocalsound } am I the only one , or uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah , on the backside . Project Manager : Well , management would like it . { vocalsound } User Interface : Well n n not not on the front side , I think . Project Manager : The front side , no no l no slogan . Industrial Designer : No not on the front , User Interface : { vocalsound } On the back { disfmarker } Yes , you you can , yeah , push that in , Industrial Designer : but on the backside . Uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : Sorry . User Interface : { vocalsound } so that it is always be there . Industrial Designer : I think it 's a nice idea , { vocalsound } to make it more recognisable , that the next to the logo you have the slogan . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : I agree . Industrial Designer : To make more uh of an impression . Marketing : But not too big . Industrial Designer : Not too big . No , Marketing : Just uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : very small . Not { vocalsound } on the entire back , but uh just very small . Marketing : { vocalsound } You have to make this titanium too . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } But readable enough of course . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo Industrial Designer : But we 'll uh we 'll take that uh with us into the design . User Interface : Yeah I think over here the logo . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Lo Uh yeah . Or maybe here in the middle , but we 'll decide later . Project Manager : and logo also on the front but not exchange uh { disfmarker } Uh ? Hmm ? { vocalsound } { gap } Uh when changing fronts . Marketing : { vocalsound } { gap } { vocalsound } Project Manager : Alright , that 's decided . 
Query : What does the group discuss on the problem of dust in the control ? Industrial Designer : Do you do you see a bit of the of the um of the uh titanium ? O on the front ? Project Manager : Five minutes left . Industrial Designer : Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium , User Interface : Yes we could { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { gap } the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen . So { disfmarker } Project Manager : So a bit of titanium between ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . No no betwe Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : That 's a bit { disfmarker } Oh that that 's that 's pretty cool . Industrial Designer : of between we can do but { disfmarker } But then you have two parts of front , two fronts that { disfmarker } User Interface : No , they have two fronts , Marketing : No no no no . User Interface : that . You you can { disfmarker } Project Manager : No ? User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : This enti entire bottom ? Marketing : Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_ . Like dust in it and so things like that . Project Manager : Yes . User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : When you exchange all the fronts and it 's open . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : I already have uh all kinds of uh filth between the mobile . User Interface : No , you can you can just { disfmarker } And then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something . Marketing : you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is . Because it has to be uh there all the time you know . Industrial Designer : And then the lower part is titanium ? User Interface : This is titanium . And this is uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : I think that 's nice , yeah . Marketing : Yeah . Some some kind of wei weight in it . Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Round forms . User Interface : F front . Industrial Designer : Yeah . I like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . With the with the curved edge . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : A bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Maybe you can show it . It also has the those { vocalsound } two distinct uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Tada . Industrial Designer : Mm bit like this . Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Uh it 's uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , Project Manager : What ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : Ah . Industrial Designer : That uh { disfmarker } Project Manager : So round where ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Maybe a nice touch , yeah . Marketing : So uh a little corner of titanium . We ca n't uh take a blank one . User Interface : Yeah , that 's nice finishing touch you need . Project Manager : Oh , yeah . Marketing : Or can we ? Project Manager : Yes , { gap } that also sounds uh pretty uh neat . Industrial Designer : { gap } Marketing : So this this is the exchangeable part . Industrial Designer : I think I 'm going to buy it . Project Manager : { vocalsound } We want it . User Interface : Yeah , this is the front . Project Manager : And it 's only f twenty five Euros . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Come on . Industrial Designer : That 's a bit too much , but { disfmarker } Project Manager : No that 's nothing . Industrial Designer : No , no no no , but { vocalsound } I think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually . Project Manager : The Phillips remote uh costs more . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Of course , because it 's my design but { disfmarker } Marketing : Right . User Interface : My design . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : No our d our design , alright . Marketing : { vocalsound } Taking all the credit . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Well uh you two are going to work together . You 'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop , and then uh { vocalsound } you uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . We 'll stay here I guess ? Marketing : But there 's a problem . Project Manager : Well I think we can , I just { gap } { disfmarker } It 's { disfmarker } Marketing : It 's not relaxing . User Interface : Well we can uh erase an animal I guess . Uh the fourth one . Marketing : Yeah . Nah that 's alright , that 's alright . Industrial Designer : But do n't erase my cat . Project Manager : Yeah , o User Interface : Uh the fourth one is empty , is n't it ? Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Project Manager : Oh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : I want to preserve it . Project Manager : { gap } { vocalsound } User Interface : { gap } Marketing : { gap } This one is empty . User Interface : Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : You have to empty one huh ? Project Manager : Oh , we have a { gap } one . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : What are you doing chief ? Project Manager : So , you can uh draw a { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : Alright . User Interface : Yeah I think we have to wait ? Industrial Designer : Yeah Project Manager : Well I 'll get a { disfmarker } I 'll get the message . Industrial Designer : until the until the beep goes . Marketing : No { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : But I do n't uh { disfmarker } Do we have to stay here , Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : No , I think uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : or I think we have to return first . Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Well you 'll { disfmarker } Maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here . { gap } User Interface : Maybe . Project Manager : Or get your mouse . Because it 's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates . Industrial Designer : The high powers from above { vocalsound } will have to tell us , yeah . 
Query : Summarize the meeting Professor B : I think for two years we were two months , uh , away from being done . PhD A : And what was that , Morgan ? What project ? Professor B : Uh , the , uh , TORRENT chip . PhD A : Oh . Professor B : Yeah . We were two { disfmarker } we were { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . Professor B : Uh , uh , we went through it { disfmarker } Jim and I went through old emails at one point and { disfmarker } and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're { disfmarker } we 're two months away from being done . It was very { disfmarker } very believable schedules , too . I mean , we went through and { disfmarker } with the schedules { disfmarker } and we { disfmarker } PhD A : It was true for two years . Professor B : Yeah . Oh , yeah . It was very true . PhD A : So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we { pause } go around and do , uh , status report { pause } kind of things ? OK . And I guess when Sunil gets here he can do his last or something . So . Professor B : Yeah . So we { pause } probably should wait for him to come before we do his . PhD C : Mm - hmm . PhD A : OK . That 's a good idea . Professor B : Yeah . Grad F : OK . Professor B : Yeah . PhD A : Any objection ? Do y OK , M Professor B : All in favor PhD A : Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or { disfmarker } ? Professor B : Uh , I do n't do anything . I { disfmarker } No , I mean , I { disfmarker } I 'm involved in discussions with { disfmarker } with people about what they 're doing , but I think they 're { disfmarker } since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves . Grad F : OK . So should I go so that , uh , PhD A : Yeah . Why do n't you go ahead , Barry ? Grad F : you 're gon na talk about Aurora stuff , per se ? PhD A : OK . Grad F : OK . Um . Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my { disfmarker } my proposal . So , um { disfmarker } Mmm . I just finished a section on , uh { disfmarker } on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , um , as a { disfmarker } as a middle step . And , um , I hope to { disfmarker } hope to get this , um { disfmarker } a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan . PhD A : When is your , uh , meeting ? Grad F : Um , my meeting PhD A : Yeah . Grad F : with , uh { disfmarker } ? Oh , oh , you mean the { disfmarker } the quals . PhD A : The quals . Yeah . Grad F : Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth . PhD A : Oh . Soon . Grad F : Yeah . PhD A : Uh - huh . Grad F : D - Day . PhD A : Yeah . Grad F : Uh - huh . PhD A : So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and { disfmarker } ? Grad F : Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . And , um , and then , um { disfmarker } then everybody asks you questions . PhD A : Hmm . Grad F : Yeah . PhD A : I remember now . Grad F : Yep . So , um . PhD A : Have you d ? I was just gon na ask , do you want to say any { disfmarker } a little bit about it , Grad F : Y s PhD A : or { disfmarker } ? Mmm . Grad F : Oh . Uh , a little bit about { disfmarker } ? PhD A : Wh - what you 're { disfmarker } what you 're gon na { disfmarker } You said { disfmarker } you were talking about the , uh , particular features that you were looking at , Grad F : Oh , the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } PhD A : or { disfmarker } Grad F : Right . Well , I was , um , I think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features { disfmarker } in intermediate categories to { disfmarker } to classify right away . But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with { disfmarker } with a reasonable set . Something { disfmarker } something like , um , um { disfmarker } like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to { disfmarker } just to start off that way . And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um { disfmarker } these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . Look at { disfmarker } then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . That would { disfmarker } that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . And then { disfmarker } and then { vocalsound } reiterate . Um , build the intermediate classifiers . Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new { disfmarker } or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again . PhD A : So you 're gon na use TIMIT ? Grad F : Um , for that { disfmarker } for that part of the { disfmarker } the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : And , um , then { disfmarker } after { disfmarker } after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . Right ? PhD A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Um , that 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } that 's , um { disfmarker } that 's just the ph the phone recognition task . PhD A : Yeah . Grad F : Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard , uh , where I 'd { disfmarker } I would be able to , um { disfmarker } to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes , PhD A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : not just within the phonemes , themselves , um , and then do the same process there , um , on { disfmarker } on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . Uh , and for that { disfmarker } for that part I would { disfmarker } I 'd use the SRI recognizer since it 's already set up for { disfmarker } for Switchboard . And I 'd run some { disfmarker } some sort of tandem - style processing with , uh , my intermediate classifiers . PhD A : Oh . So that 's why you were interested in getting your own features into the SRI files . Grad F : Yeah . That 's why I { disfmarker } I was asking about that . PhD A : Yeah . Yeah . Grad F : Yeah . Um , and I guess that 's { disfmarker } that 's it . Any { disfmarker } any questions ? PhD A : Sounds good . So you just have a few more weeks , huh ? Grad F : Um , yeah . A few more . PhD A : It 's about a month from now ? Grad F : It 's a { disfmarker } it 's a month and { disfmarker } and a week . PhD A : Yeah . Grad F : Yeah . PhD A : So , uh , you want to go next , Dave ? And we 'll do { disfmarker } Grad E : Oh . OK , sure . So , um , last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach . And , um , we { disfmarker } we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , um , { vocalsound } six percent to four point five percent , um , on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent . And , um , wh why would that be , um , { vocalsound } considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so , uh , with some input from , uh , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts . Um , first of all HTK { disfmarker } sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , and so HTK was n't . Um , so this , um { disfmarker } This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel { pause } normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that would n't have been applied in the SRI case . And also , um , the { disfmarker } Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters . It 's got finer - grained acoustic models . So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts { pause } in the re - synthesized audio . Um . And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have { pause } different phones { pause } lined up with a different foreground phone , { vocalsound } um , { vocalsound } depending on { pause } the timing of the echo . So , um , I 'm gon na try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . So I 'm planning to use the Macrophone set of , um , read speech , and , um { disfmarker } Hmm . Professor B : I had another thought just now , which is , uh , remember we were talking before about { disfmarker } we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that { disfmarker } some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy { pause } sections ? Um , uh , if you { disfmarker } if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in { pause } late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a { disfmarker } an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you got ta figure out what to do with them if you 're gon na continue treating this as a power spectrum . So , what { disfmarker } what Hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero { disfmarker } set the negative values to zero . So if you imagine a { disfmarker } a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in { disfmarker } So in this case you have some artificially imposed { pause } reverberation - like thing . I mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , uh , at n And , um , what if you did { disfmarker } ? I mean , there 's nothing to say that the { disfmarker } the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . I mean , you also could , uh , just try to make it nicer . Grad E : Uh - huh . Professor B : And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor B : and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some { disfmarker } some , uh , very low or { disfmarker } or near zero { pause } value . I mean , uh , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that { disfmarker } that these echoes that you 're hearing are , uh { disfmarker } Grad E : Uh - huh . Professor B : or pre - echoes , whichever they are { disfmarker } are { disfmarker } are , uh , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them . Grad E : Uh - huh . Professor B : Be pretty simple . I mean , you do it in a pretty conservative way Grad E : OK . Professor B : so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to { pause } keep in an echo than to throw out speech . Grad E : Hmm . PhD G : Um , what is the reverberation time { pause } like { pause } there ? Grad E : In thi in this room ? Uh { disfmarker } PhD G : On , uh , the { disfmarker } the one what { disfmarker } the s in the speech that you are { disfmarker } you are using like ? Grad E : Y Yeah . I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I do n't know . Professor B : So , it 's this room . PhD G : It 's , uh { disfmarker } Professor B : It 's { disfmarker } it 's this room . PhD G : Oh , this room ? Professor B : So { disfmarker } PhD G : OK . Professor B : so it 's { disfmarker } these are just microphone { disfmarker } this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on . Grad F : Oh . Professor B : Uh , we should do a measurement in here . I g think we never have . I think it 's { disfmarker } I would guess , uh , point seven , point eight seconds f uh , R T Grad F : Hmm ! Professor B : something like that ? But it 's { disfmarker } you know , it 's this room . PhD G : Mm - hmm . Professor B : So . PhD G : OK . Mm - hmm . Professor B : Uh . But the other thing is , he 's putting in { disfmarker } w I was using the word `` reverberation `` in two ways . He 's also putting in , uh , a { disfmarker } he 's taking out some reverberation , but he 's putting in something , because he has { pause } averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , which are then being subtracted from the speech . And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be { disfmarker } you 'll be subtracting from some larger number and sometimes you wo n't . And { disfmarker } PhD G : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor B : So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away . Uh , and if it 's a low { pause } energy compo portion , you might actually hear some { pause } funny things . PhD G : Yeah . Grad E : O o one thing , um , I noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is { pause } just as a kind of gain control ? Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you do n't amplify them . PhD C : Mm - hmm . I do n't see why { disfmarker } why your signal is louder after processing , because yo Grad E : Yeah . I do n't know why - y , uh , either . PhD C : Yeah . Professor B : I do n't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Oh , OK . Professor B : Yeah . I mean , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have { pause } better signal - to - noise ratio . PhD C : Well , well { disfmarker } Professor B : So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : But just it being bigger if { disfmarker } with the same signal - to - noise ratio { disfmarker } Grad E : It w i i it would n't affect things . Professor B : No . PhD C : Yeah . Grad E : OK . PhD C : Well , the system is { disfmarker } use { pause } the absolute energy , so it 's a little bit dependent on { disfmarker } on the { pause } signal level . But , not so much , I guess . Professor B : Well , yeah . But it 's trained and tested on the same thing . PhD C : Mmm . Professor B : So if the { disfmarker } if the { disfmarker } if you change { vocalsound } in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Yeah . PhD A : Did you add { pause } this data to the training set , for the Aurora ? Or you just tested on this ? Grad E : Uh { disfmarker } Um . Did I w what ? PhD A : Well , Morgan was just saying that , uh , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it should n't have any effect . Grad E : Sorry ? Yeah . PhD A : But I { disfmarker } I was { pause } sort of under the impression that you just tested with this data . Grad E : I { disfmarker } I b PhD A : You did n't { pause } train it also . Grad E : I { disfmarker } Right . I trained on clean TI - digits . I { disfmarker } I did the mean subtraction on clean TI - digits . But I did n't { disfmarker } I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder . Professor B : Oh , I see . Grad E : I only remember noticing it made the , um , PZM signal louder . Professor B : OK . Well , I do n't understand then . Yeah . Grad E : Huh . I do n't know . If it 's { disfmarker } if it 's { disfmarker } like , if it 's trying to find a { disfmarker } a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter . And then if you take it out { disfmarker } that taking it out makes things louder . I mean . Professor B : Uh , no . I mean , { vocalsound } uh , there 's { disfmarker } there 's nothing inherent about removing { disfmarker } if you 're really removing , Grad E : Nuh - huh . Professor B : uh , r uh , then I do n't { pause } see how that would make it louder . Grad E : The mean . OK . Yeah , I see . Professor B : So it might be just some { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah . OK . So I should maybe listen to that stuff again . Professor B : Yeah . It might just be some artifact of the processing that { disfmarker } that , uh , if you 're { disfmarker } Uh , yeah . I do n't know . Grad E : Oh . OK . PhD A : I wonder if there could be something like , uh { disfmarker } for s for the PZM data , PhD C : Eh PhD A : uh , you know , if occasionally , uh , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike . Uh . I 'm just wondering if there 's something about the , um { disfmarker } you know , doing the mean normalization where , uh , it { disfmarker } it could cause { pause } you to have better signal - to - noise ratio . Um . Professor B : Well , you know , there is this . Wait a minute . It { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } i maybe { disfmarker } i If , um { disfmarker } Subtracting the { disfmarker } the mean log spectrum is { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } is like dividing by the spectrum . So , depending what you divide by , if your { disfmarker } if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're { disfmarker } you 're { disfmarker } you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor B : So , it 's { disfmarker } it 's just a { disfmarker } a question of { disfmarker } there 's { disfmarker } It { disfmarker } it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing , or something to make it { disfmarker } Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor B : Uh , y you 'd think it should n't be larger , but maybe in practice it is . That 's something to think about . Grad E : Hmm . Professor B : I do n't know . PhD C : I had a question about the system { disfmarker } the SRI system . So , { vocalsound } you trained it on TI - digits ? But except this , it 's exactly the same system as the one that was tested before and that was trained on { pause } Macrophone . Right ? So on TI - digits it gives you one point two percent error rate and on Macrophone it 's still O point eight . Uh , but is it { pause } exactly the same system ? Grad E : Uh . I think so . PhD C : Hmm . Grad E : If you 're talking about the Macrophone results that Andreas had about , um , a week and a half ago , I think it 's the same system . PhD C : Mm - hmm . So you use VTL - uh , vocal tract length normalization and , um , like MLLR transformations also , Grad E : Mm - hmm . PhD C : and { disfmarker } Professor B : I 'm sorry , was his point eight percent , er , a { disfmarker } a result on testing on Macrophone or { disfmarker } or training ? PhD C : all that stuff . Grad E : That 's { disfmarker } PhD C : It was { pause } training on Macrophone and testing { disfmarker } yeah , on { disfmarker } on meeting digits . Professor B : Oh . So that was done already . So we were { disfmarker } Uh , and it 's point eight ? OK . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : OK . PhD C : Yeah . I { disfmarker } I 've just been text { comment } testing the new { pause } Aurora front - end with { disfmarker } well , Aurora system actually { disfmarker } so front - end and HTK , um , acoustic models on the meeting digits and it 's a little bit better than the previous system . We have { disfmarker } I have two point seven percent error rate . And before with the system that was proposed , it 's what ? It was three point nine . So . Professor B : Oh , that 's a lot better . PhD C : We are getting better . Professor B : So , what { disfmarker } w ? PhD C : And { disfmarker } PhD G : With the { disfmarker } with the HTK back - end ? What we have for Aurora ? PhD C : Yeah . Two point seven . PhD G : I know in the meeting , like { disfmarker } PhD C : On the meeting we have two point seven . PhD G : Right . Oh . Grad F : That 's with the new IIR filters ? PhD C : Uh . Yeah , yeah . So , yeah , Grad F : OK . PhD C : we have { pause } the new LDA filters , and { disfmarker } I think , maybe { disfmarker } I did n't look , but one thing that makes a difference is this DC offset compensation . Uh , eh { disfmarker } Do y did you have a look at { disfmarker } at the meet uh , meeting digits , if they have a DC component , or { disfmarker } ? Grad E : I { disfmarker } I did n't . No . PhD C : Oh . Professor B : Hmm . PhD G : No . The DC component could be negligible . I mean , if you are { pause } recording it through a mike . I mean , any { disfmarker } all of the mikes have the DC removal { disfmarker } some capacitor sitting right in { pause } that bias it . Professor B : Yeah . But this { disfmarker } uh , uh , uh , no . Because , uh , there 's a sample and hold in the A - toD . And these period these typically do have a DC offset . PhD G : Oh , OK . Professor B : And { disfmarker } and they can be surprisingly large . It depends on the electronics . PhD G : Oh , so it is the digital { disfmarker } OK . It 's the A - toD that introduces the DC in . Professor B : Yeah . The microphone is n't gon na pass any DC . PhD G : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Professor B : But { disfmarker } but , PhD G : OK . Professor B : typi you know , unless { disfmarker } Actually , there are { pause } instrumentation mikes that { disfmarker } that do pass { disfmarker } go down to DC . But { disfmarker } but , PhD G : Mm - hmm . Professor B : uh , no , it 's the electronics . And they { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } PhD G : Mm - hmm . Professor B : then there 's amplification afterwards . And you can get , I think it was { disfmarker } I think it was in the { pause } Wall Street Journal data that { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } I ca n't remember , one of the DARPA things . There was this big DC - DC offset PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor B : we did n't { disfmarker } we did n't know about for a while , while we were { pause } messing with it . And we were getting these terrible results . And then we were talking to somebody and they said , `` Oh , yeah . Did n't you know ? Everybody knows that . There 's all this DC offset in th `` So , yes . You can have DC offset in the data . PhD G : Oh , OK . Professor B : Yeah . PhD G : OK . PhD A : So was that { disfmarker } was that everything , Dave ? Grad E : Oh . And I also , um , did some experiments { pause } about normalizing the phase . Um . So I c I came up with a web page that people can take a look at . And , um , the interesting thing that I tried was , um , Adam and Morgan had this idea , um , since my original attempts to , um , take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , did n't work . Um , so , well , that we thought that might be due to , um , problems with , um , the arithmetic of phases . They { disfmarker } they add in this modulo two pi way and , um , there 's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum was n't really { pause } mathematically correct . So , { vocalsound } what I did instead is I { vocalsound } took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that , and I subtracted that phase { pause } off to normalize . But that , um , did n't work either . Professor B : See , we have a different interpretation of this . He says it does n't work . I said , I think it works magnificently , but just not for the task we intended . Uh , it gets rid of the speech . PhD A : What does it leave ? Grad F : Uh , gets rid of the speech . Professor B : Uh , it leaves { disfmarker } you know , it leaves the junk . I mean , I { disfmarker } I think it 's { disfmarker } it 's tremendous . Grad F : Oh , wow . Professor B : You see , all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before , and he 's really got something . PhD A : Well , could you take what was left over and then subtract that ? Professor B : Ex - exactly . Yeah , you got it . Grad F : Yeah . PhD G : Yeah . Professor B : So , it 's { disfmarker } it 's a general rule . PhD G : Oh , it 's { disfmarker } Professor B : Just listen very carefully to what I say and do the opposite . Including what I just said . Grad E : And , yeah , that 's everything . PhD A : All set ? Do you want to go , Stephane ? PhD C : Um . Yeah . Maybe , concerning these d still , these meeting digits . I 'm more interested in trying to figure out what 's still the difference between the SRI system and the Aurora system . And { disfmarker } Um . Yeah . So , I think I will maybe train , like , gender - dependent models , because { pause } this is also one big difference between { pause } the two systems . Um , the other differences were { pause } the fact that maybe the acoustic models of the SRI are more { disfmarker } SRI system are more complex . But , uh , Chuck , you did some experiments with this and PhD A : It did n't seem to help in the HTK system . PhD C : it was hard t to { disfmarker } to have some exper some improvement with this . Um . Professor B : Well , it sounds like they also have { disfmarker } he { disfmarker } he 's saying they have all these , uh , uh , different kinds of adaptation . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : You know , they have channel adaptation . They have speaker adaptation . PhD C : Yeah . Right . PhD A : Well , there 's also the normalization . Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . PhD C : Yeah . Grad F : Yeah . PhD A : Like they do , um { disfmarker } I 'm not sure how they would do it when they 're working with the digits , PhD C : The vocal tr PhD A : but , like , in the Switchboard data , there 's , um { disfmarker } conversation - side normalization for the { pause } non - C - zero components , PhD C : Yeah . Yeah . This is another difference . Their normalization works like on { disfmarker } on the utterance levels . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : But we have to do it { disfmarker } We have a system that does it on - line . PhD A : Right . PhD C : So , it might be { disfmarker } it might be better with { disfmarker } it might be worse if the { pause } channel is constant , PhD A : Yeah . PhD C : or { disfmarker } Nnn . PhD G : And the acoustic models are like - k triphone models or { disfmarker } or is it the whole word ? PhD C : SRI { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } it 's tr Grad F : SRI . PhD G : Yeah . PhD C : Yeah . I guess it 's triphones . PhD G : It 's triphone . Professor B : I think it 's probably more than that . PhD C : Huh . Professor B : I mean , so they { disfmarker } they have { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I thin think they use these , uh , uh , genone things . So there 's { disfmarker } there 's these kind of , uh , uh , pooled models and { disfmarker } and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies . PhD G : Oh . It 's like the tied state . Professor B : So . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor B : They have tied states and I think { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I do n't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here . But I think { disfmarker } I think they { disfmarker } they do n't just have triphones . PhD G : OK . Professor B : I think they have a range of { disfmarker } of , uh , dependencies . PhD C : Mm - hmm . PhD G : Mm - hmm . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Hmm . PhD C : And { disfmarker } Yeah . Well . Um . Well , the first thing I { disfmarker } that I want to do is just maybe these gender things . Uh . And maybe see with { pause } Andreas if { disfmarker } Well , I { disfmarker } I do n't know { pause } how much it helps , what 's the model . PhD A : So { disfmarker } so the n stuff on the numbers you got , the two point seven , is that using the same training data that the SRI system used and got one point two ? PhD C : That 's right . So it 's the clean { pause } TI - digits training set . PhD A : So exact same training data ? PhD C : Right . PhD A : OK . PhD C : Mm - hmm . I guess you used the clean training set . Grad E : Right . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Grad E : For { disfmarker } with the SRI system { disfmarker } PhD C : Well . Grad E : You know , the { disfmarker } the Aurora baseline is set up with these , um { disfmarker } { vocalsound } this version of the clean training set that 's been filtered with this G - seven - one - two filter , and , um , to train the SRI system on digits S - Andreas used the original TI - digits , um , under U doctor - speech data TI - digits , which do n't have this filter . But I do n't think there 's any other difference . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Yeah . Professor B : So is that { disfmarker } ? Uh , are { disfmarker } are these results comparable ? So you { disfmarker } you were getting with the , uh , Aurora baseline something like two point four percent { pause } on clean TI - digits , when , uh , training the SRI system with clean TR digits { disfmarker } { comment } TI - digits . Right ? And { disfmarker } Grad E : Um . Uh - huh . Professor B : Yeah . And , so , is your two point seven comparable , where you 're , uh , uh , using , uh , the submitted system ? PhD C : Yeah . I think so . Professor B : OK . PhD C : Yeah . Professor B : So it 's { pause } about the same , PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : maybe a little worse . Grad E : W w it was one { disfmarker } one point two PhD C : Ye Grad E : with the SRI system , Professor B : I 'm sorry . PhD C : Yeah . Grad E : I { disfmarker } PhD C : The complete SRI system is one point two . Professor B : You { disfmarker } you were HTK . PhD C : Yeah . Professor B : Right ? OK . That 's right . So { disfmarker } PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : OK , so { pause } the comparable number then , uh { pause } for what you were talking about then , since it was HTK , would be the { pause } um , two point f PhD C : It was four point something . Right ? The HTK system with , uh , b Grad E : D d Professor B : Oh , right , right , right , right . PhD C : MFCC features { disfmarker } Grad E : Do you mean the b ? The baseline Aurora - two system , trained on TI - digits , tested on Meeting Recorder near , I think we saw in it today , and it was about six point six percent . Professor B : Right . Right , right , right . PhD C : Oh . Professor B : OK . Alright . So { disfmarker } He 's doing some { pause } different things . PhD C : So { disfmarker } Yeah . The only difference is the features , right now , between this and { disfmarker } Professor B : Yes . OK , good . So they are helping . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : That 's good to hear . Yeah . PhD C : They are helping . Yeah . Um . Yeah . And another thing I { disfmarker } I maybe would like to do is to { pause } just test the SRI system that 's trained on Macrophone { disfmarker } test it on , uh , the noisy TI - digits , Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : cuz I 'm still wondering { pause } where this { pause } improvement comes from . When you train on Macrophone , it seems better on meeting digits . But I wonder if it 's just because maybe { pause } Macrophone is acoustically closer to the meeting digits than { disfmarker } than TI - digit is , which is { disfmarker } TI - digits are very { pause } clean recorded digits Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD C : and { disfmarker } PhD A : You know , it would also be interesting to see , uh { disfmarker } to do the regular Aurora test , PhD C : Uh , f s PhD A : um , but use the SRI system instead of HTK . PhD C : That 's { disfmarker } Yeah . That 's what { pause } I wanted , just , uh { disfmarker } Yeah . So , just using the SRI system , test it on { disfmarker } and test it on { pause } Aurora TI - digits . Right . PhD A : Why not the full Aurora , uh , test ? PhD C : Um . Yeah . There is this problem of multilinguality yet . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : So we do n't { disfmarker } Professor B : You 'd have to train the SRI system with { disfmarker } with all the different languages . PhD C : i i PhD A : Right . PhD C : We would have to train on { disfmarker } PhD A : Yeah . That 's what I mean . PhD C : Yeah . PhD A : So , like , comple Professor B : It 'd be a { pause } lot of work . That 's the only thing . PhD C : Yeah . PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : It 's { disfmarker } PhD A : Well , I mean , PhD C : Mmm . PhD A : uh , uh , I guess the work would be into getting the { disfmarker } the files in the right formats , or something . Right ? I mean { disfmarker } PhD C : Mm - hmm . PhD A : Because when you train up the Aurora system , you 're , uh { disfmarker } you 're also training on all the data . PhD C : That 's right . PhD A : I mean , it 's { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . Yeah . I see . Oh , so , OK . Right . I see what you mean . Professor B : That 's true , but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor B : because { disfmarker } on { disfmarker } on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor B : So , it 's { disfmarker } it 's a good idea , but it seems like { pause } it makes sense to do some pruning PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor B : first with a { disfmarker } a test or two that makes sense for you , PhD A : Yeah . Professor B : and then { pause } take the likely candidates and go further . PhD A : Yeah . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Yeah . But , just testing on TI - digits would already give us some information { pause } about what 's going on . And { disfmarker } mm - hmm . Uh , yeah . OK . Uh , the next thing is this { disfmarker } this VAD problem that , um , um { disfmarker } So , I 'm just talking about the { disfmarker } the curves that I { disfmarker } I sent { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I sent you { disfmarker } so , whi that shows that { vocalsound } when the SNR decrease , { vocalsound } uh , the current { pause } VAD approach does n't drop much frames { pause } for some particular noises , uh , which might be then noises that are closer to speech , uh , acoustically . Professor B : I i Just to clarify something for me . I They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : So does any of this matter ? I mean , other than our interest in it . Uh { disfmarker } PhD C : Uh { disfmarker } Well . First of all , the boundaries might be , uh { disfmarker } like we would have t two hundred milliseconds or { disfmarker } before and after speech . Uh . So removing more than that might still make { pause } a difference { pause } in the results . Professor B : Do we { disfmarker } ? I mean , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ? PhD C : And { disfmarker } No . Because we do n't { disfmarker } did n't looked { pause } that much at that . Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : But , { vocalsound } still , I think it 's an interesting problem . Professor B : Oh , yeah . PhD C : And { disfmarker } Um . Yeah . Professor B : But maybe we 'll get some insight on that when { disfmarker } when , uh , the gang gets back from Crete . Because { pause } there 's lots of interesting problems , of course . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : And then the thing is if { disfmarker } if they really are going to have some means of giving us { pause } fairly tight , uh , boundaries , then that wo n't be so much the issue . PhD C : Yeah , yeah . Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor B : Um But { vocalsound } I do n't know . PhD G : Because w we were wondering whether that { pause } VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation . And then , like , if { disfmarker } if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , I mean , the way we want Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD G : to find a { disfmarker } I mean , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more { pause } suitable for us . Professor B : Right . PhD G : But if that is going to be something like a manual , uh , segmenter , then we ca n't { pause } use that information anymore , PhD C : Mm - hmm . PhD G : because that 's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation . Professor B : Right . PhD G : So . We do n't know what is the type of { pause } { vocalsound } { pause } VAD which they 're going to provide . Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : Yeah . And actually there 's { disfmarker } Yeah . There 's an { disfmarker } uh , I think it 's still for { disfmarker } even for the evaluation , uh , it might still be interesting to { vocalsound } work on this because { pause } the boundaries apparently that they would provide is just , { vocalsound } um , starting of speech and end of speech { pause } uh , at the utterance level . And { disfmarker } Um . PhD G : With some { disfmarker } some gap . PhD C : So { disfmarker } PhD G : I mean , with some pauses in the center , provided they meet that { disfmarker } whatever the hang - over time which they are talking . PhD C : Yeah . But when you have like , uh , five or six frames , both { disfmarker } PhD G : Yeah . Then the they will just fill { disfmarker } fill it up . PhD C : it { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } with { disfmarker } PhD G : I mean , th { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD C : Yeah . Professor B : So if you could get at some of that , uh { disfmarker } PhD C : So { disfmarker } Professor B : although that 'd be hard . PhD C : Yeah . It might be useful for , like , noise estimation , and a lot of other { pause } things that we want to work on . Professor B : But { disfmarker } but { disfmarker } Yeah . PhD G : Yeah . Professor B : Right . OK . PhD C : But { disfmarker } Mmm . Yeah . So I did { disfmarker } I just { pause } started to test { pause } putting together two VAD which was { disfmarker } was not much work actually . Um , I im re - implemented a VAD that 's very close to the , { vocalsound } um , energy - based VAD { vocalsound } that , uh , the other Aurora guys use . Um . So , which is just putting a threshold on { pause } the noise energy , Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD C : and , detect detecting the first { pause } group of four frames { pause } that have a energy that 's above this threshold , and , uh , from this point , uh , tagging the frames there as speech . So it removes { vocalsound } the first silent portion { disfmarker } portion of each utterance . And it really removes it , um , still o on the noises where { pause } our MLP VAD does n't { pause } work a lot . Professor B : Mmm . PhD C : Uh , Professor B : Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral { pause } information , PhD C : and { disfmarker } Professor B : uh { disfmarker } uh , you know , in the old days people would use energy and zero crossings , for instance { disfmarker } uh , would give you some { pause } better performance . Right ? Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or { disfmarker } or , uh { pause } stop consonants , or something like that . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : Uh . PhD C : Yeah . So , your point is { disfmarker } will be to u use whatever { disfmarker } Professor B : Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and do n't look at anything spectral , then you do n't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and { pause } nonspeech . And , um , PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic , some sort of slope . And { disfmarker } and most , um , low - energy speech components that are unvoiced have a { disfmarker } a high - pass kind of characteristic { disfmarker } PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : an upward slope . So having some kind of a { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . Professor B : uh , you know , at the beginning of a { disfmarker } of a { disfmarker } of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy , PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : but it will tend to have this high - frequency component . Whereas , { vocalsound } a { disfmarker } a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency . Uh , you know , by itself it 's not enough to tell you , but it plus energy is sort of { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . Professor B : it plus energy plus timing information is sort of { disfmarker } PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : I mean , if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something , that 's sort of { pause } what they were using then . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : So it 's { disfmarker } it 's not a { disfmarker } PhD C : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Hmm . PhD C : So , yeah . It { disfmarker } it might be that what I did is { disfmarker } so , removes like { vocalsound } low , um , { vocalsound } uh { disfmarker } low - energy , uh , speech frames . Because { pause } the way I do it is I just { disfmarker } I just combine the two decisions { disfmarker } so , the one from the MLP and the one from the energy - based { disfmarker } with the { disfmarker } with the and { pause } operator . So , I only { pause } keep the frames where the two agree { pause } that it 's speech . So if the energy - based dropped { disfmarker } dropped low - energy speech , mmm , they { disfmarker } they are { disfmarker } they are lost . Mmm . Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD C : But s still , the way it 's done right now it { disfmarker } it helps on { disfmarker } on the noises where { disfmarker } it seems to help on the noises where { vocalsound } our VAD was not very { pause } good . Professor B : Well , I guess { disfmarker } I mean , one could imagine combining them in different ways . But { disfmarker } but , I guess what you 're saying is that the { disfmarker } the MLP - based one has the spectral information . So . PhD C : Yeah . But { disfmarker } Yeah . But the way it 's combined wi is maybe done { disfmarker } Well , yeah . Professor B : Well , you can imagine { disfmarker } PhD C : The way I use a an a `` AND `` operator is { disfmarker } So , it { disfmarker } I , uh { disfmarker } Professor B : Is { disfmarker } ? PhD C : The frames that are dropped by the energy - based system are { disfmarker } are , uh , dropped , even if the , um , MLP decides to keep them . Professor B : Right . Right . And that might not be optimal , PhD C : But , yeah . Professor B : but { disfmarker } PhD C : Mm - hmm . PhD A : No Professor B : but { disfmarker } I mean , I guess in principle what you 'd want to do is have a { disfmarker } { vocalsound } uh , a probability estimated by each one and { disfmarker } and put them together . PhD C : Yeah . Mmm . M Yeah . PhD A : Something that { disfmarker } that I 've used in the past is , um { disfmarker } when just looking at the energy , is to look at the derivative . And you { pause } make your decision when the derivative is increasing for { pause } so many frames . Then you say that 's beginning of speech . PhD C : Uh - huh . PhD A : But , I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm trying to remember if that requires that you keep some amount of speech in a buffer . I guess it depends on how you do it . But { pause } I mean , that 's { disfmarker } that 's been a useful thing . Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Mm - hmm . PhD G : Yeah . Well , every everywhere has a delay associated with it . I mean , you still have to k always keep a buffer , PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD G : then only make a decision because { pause } you still need to smooth the { pause } decision further . PhD A : Right . Right . PhD G : So that 's always there . PhD A : Yeah . OK . PhD C : Well , actually if I do n't { disfmarker } maybe do n't want to work too much of { disfmarker } on it right now . I just wanted to { disfmarker } to see if it 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } what I observed was the re was caused by this { disfmarker } this VAD problem . Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD C : And it seems to be the case . Um . Uh , the second thing is the { disfmarker } this spectral subtraction . Um . Um , which I 've just started yesterday to launch a bunch of , uh , { nonvocalsound } twenty - five experiments , uh , with different , uh , values for the parameters that are used . So , it 's the Makhoul - type spectral subtraction which use { pause } an over - estimation factor . So , we substr I subtract more , { vocalsound } { vocalsound } um , { nonvocalsound } { vocalsound } noise than the noise spectra that { pause } is estimated { pause } on the noise portion of the s uh , the utterances . So I tried several , uh , over - estimation factors . And after subtraction , I also add { pause } a constant noise , and I also try different , uh , { vocalsound } noise , uh , values and we 'll see what happen . Professor B : Hmm . OK . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . But st still when we look at the , um { disfmarker } Well , it depends on the parameters that you use , but for moderate over - estimation factors and moderate noise level that you add , you st have a lot of musical noise . Um . On the other hand , when you { pause } subtract more and when you add more noise , you get rid of this musical noise but { pause } maybe you distort a lot of speech . So . Well . Mmm . Well , it { disfmarker } until now , it does n't seem to help . But We 'll see . So the next thing , maybe I { disfmarker } what I will { pause } try to { disfmarker } to do is just { pause } to try to smooth mmm , { vocalsound } the , um { disfmarker } to smooth the d the result of the subtraction , to get rid of the musical noise , using some kind of filter , or { disfmarker } PhD G : Can smooth the SNR estimate , also . PhD C : Yeah . Right . Mmm . PhD G : Your filter is a function of SNR . Hmm ? PhD C : Yeah . So , to get something that 's { disfmarker } would be closer to { pause } what you tried to do with Wiener filtering . PhD G : Yeah . PhD C : And { disfmarker } Mm - hmm . Yeah . PhD G : Actually , it 's , uh { disfmarker } Uh . I do n't know , it 's { disfmarker } go ahead . PhD C : It { disfmarker } PhD G : And it 's { disfmarker } PhD C : Maybe you can { disfmarker } PhD G : go ahead . PhD C : I think it 's { disfmarker } That 's it for me . PhD G : OK . So , uh { disfmarker } u th I 've been playing with this Wiener filter , like . And there are { disfmarker } there were some bugs in the program , so I was p initially trying to clear them up . Because one of the bug was { disfmarker } I was assuming that always the VAD { disfmarker } uh , the initial frames were silence . It always started in the silence state , but it was n't for some utterances . So the { disfmarker } it was n't estimating the noise initially , and then it never estimated , because I assumed that it was always silence . PhD C : Mm - hmm . So this is on SpeechDat - Car Italian ? PhD G : Yeah . PhD C : So , in some cases s there are also { disfmarker } PhD G : SpeechDat - Car Italian . Yeah . There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are . PhD C : o Uh - huh . PhD G : So that was one of the { pause } bugs that was there in estimating the noise . And , uh , so once it was cleared , uh , I ran a few experiments with { pause } different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also . And so the { disfmarker } the trend seems to be like , { vocalsound } uh , smoothing the { pause } current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR , which is like { pause } deriving the Wiener filter , seems to be helping . Then updating it quite fast using a very small time constant . So we 'll have , like , a few results where the { disfmarker } estimating the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } More smoothing is helping . But still it 's like { disfmarker } it 's still comparable to the baseline . I have n't got anything beyond the baseline . But that 's , like , not using any Wiener filter . And , uh , so I 'm { disfmarker } I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR . So there are three time constants that I have . So , I 'm just playing around . So , one is fixed in the line , like { pause } Smoothing the clean speech is { disfmarker } is helping , so I 'm not going to change it that much . But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying { disfmarker } trying a little bit . So , that h And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , uh , SNR , because that { disfmarker } if some { disfmarker } In some cases the clean speech is , like { disfmarker } when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values , so the SNR is , like , very low . And so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech . So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it does n't { pause } vary a lot in the low - energy regions . And , uh . So . The results are , like { disfmarker } So far I 've been testing only with the { pause } baseline , which is { disfmarker } which does n't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization . I just want to separate the { disfmarker } the contributions out . So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system , which is , uh , just the spectral { disfmarker } I mean , the mel sp mel , uh , frequency coefficients . Um . And the other thing that I tried was { disfmarker } but I just { vocalsound } took of those , uh , { pause } { vocalsound } Carlos filters , which Hynek had , to see whether it really h helps or not . I mean , it was just a { disfmarker } a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps . And it 's { disfmarker } it seems to be like it 's not { vocalsound } hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter which is nothing but a { pause } four hertz { disfmarker } a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum . So , that was the filter that Hy - uh , Carlos had . And so { disfmarker } Yeah . Just { disfmarker } just to see whether it really { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } is it worth trying or not . So , it does n't seems to be degrading a lot on that . So there must be something that I can { disfmarker } that can be done with that type of noise compensation also , which { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I guess I would ask Carlos about that . I mean , how { disfmarker } how he derived those filters and { disfmarker } and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which { disfmarker } what we are using currently , or something like that . So maybe I 'll { disfmarker } Professor B : This is cubic root of power spectra ? PhD G : Yeah . Cubic root of power spectrum . Professor B : So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values . Right ? PhD G : Yeah . And I 'm , like , floating it to z zeros right now . Professor B : OK . PhD G : So it has , like { disfmarker } the spectrogram has , like { disfmarker } Uh , it actually , uh , enhances the onset and offset of { disfmarker } I mean , the { disfmarker } the begin and the end of the speech . So it 's { disfmarker } there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions , Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD G : because the filter has , like , a sort of Mexican - hat type structure . Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD G : So , those are the regions where there are , like { disfmarker } when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech . But the rest of it seems to be , like , pretty nice . Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD G : So . That 's { pause } something I observe using that filter . And { disfmarker } Yeah . There are a few { disfmarker } very { disfmarker } not a lot of { disfmarker } because the filter does n't have a { disfmarker } really a deep negative portion , so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root . So , I 'll { disfmarker } I 'll s may continue with that for some w I 'll { disfmarker } I 'll { disfmarker } Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters , and { disfmarker } but while { pause } making this Wiener filter better . So . Yeah . That { disfmarker } that 's it , Morgan . Professor B : Uh , last week you were also talking about building up the subspace { pause } stuff ? PhD G : Yeah . I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I would actually m m did n't get enough time to work on the subspace last week . It was mostly about { pause } finding those bugs and Professor B : OK . PhD G : th you know , things , and I did n't work much on that . PhD A : How about you , Carmen ? PhD D : Well , I am still working with , eh , VTS . And , one of the things that last week , eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff because the signal have different level of energy . Professor B : Hmm ? PhD D : And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to { disfmarker } to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS . But then { vocalsound } we decided that that 's { disfmarker } it does n't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise . And { disfmarker } Well , thinking about that , we { disfmarker } we then { disfmarker } we decide that maybe is a good idea . We do n't know . I do n't hav I do n't { disfmarker } this is { disfmarker } I did n't { pause } do the experiment yet { disfmarker } to apply VTS in cepstral domain . Professor B : The other thing { pause } is { disfmarker } So { disfmarker } so , in { disfmarker } i i and { disfmarker } Not { disfmarker } and C - zero would be a different { disfmarker } So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway . I mean , the other thing I was gon na suggest is that you could have { pause } two kinds of normalization with { disfmarker } with , uh , different time constants . So , uh , you could do some normalization { vocalsound } s uh , before the VTS , and then do some other normalization after . I do n't know . But { disfmarker } but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do , PhD D : Uh . Professor B : so that 's { disfmarker } PhD C : Mm - hmm . PhD D : Well , we s decide to m to { disfmarker } to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain . And { disfmarker } Well . I am working in that now , Professor B : Uh - huh . PhD D : but { vocalsound } I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful . I do n't know . It 's k it 's k It 's quite a lot { disfmarker } It 's a lot of work . Professor B : Uh - huh . PhD D : Well , it 's not too much , but this { disfmarker } it 's work . Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : And I want to know if { disfmarker } if we have some { pause } feeling that { pause } the result { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I would like to know if { disfmarker } I do n't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel { disfmarker } in filter bank domain . I r I 'm not sure . I do n't { disfmarker } I do n't know absolutely nothing . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : Yeah . Well , you 're { disfmarker } I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS , so , uh , maybe we could call someone else up who has , ask them their opinion . Uh , PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : I do n't { disfmarker } I do n't have a good feeling for it . Um . PhD G : Pratibha . PhD C : Actually , the VTS that you tested before was in the log domain and so { pause } the codebook is e e kind of dependent on the { pause } level of the speech signal . PhD D : Yeah ? PhD C : And { disfmarker } So I expect it { disfmarker } If { disfmarker } if you have something that 's independent of this , I expect it to { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } to , uh , be a better model of speech . PhD D : To have better { disfmarker } PhD C : And . Well . Professor B : You { disfmarker } you would n't even need to switch to cepstra . Right ? I mean , you can just sort of normalize the { disfmarker } PhD C : No . We could normali norm I mean , remove the median . Professor B : Yeah . Yeah . And then you have { pause } one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level , PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : and the other which is n't . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Yeah . But here also we would have to be careful about removing the mean { pause } of speech and not of noise . PhD D : Ye PhD C : Because it 's like { pause } first doing general normalization PhD D : Yea PhD C : and then noise removal , which is { disfmarker } PhD D : Yeah . We { disfmarker } I was thinking to { disfmarker } to { disfmarker } to estimate the noise { pause } with the first frames and then apply the VAD , Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD C : Mm - hmm . PhD D : before the on - line normalization . PhD C : Mm - hmm . PhD D : We { disfmarker } we see { disfmarker } Well , I am thinking { vocalsound } about that and working about that , Professor B : Yeah . PhD D : but I do n't have result this week . Professor B : Sure . I mean , one of the things we 've talked about { disfmarker } maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ? Because { pause } we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them . Maybe { disfmarker } maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their { pause } characteristics are , PhD D : Mm - hmm . Professor B : so we can see what should be combined . PhD C : Mm - hmm . PhD A : Is that it ? OK ? Professor B : OK . Why do n't we read some digits ? PhD A : Yep . Want to go ahead , Morgan ? Professor B : Sure . PhD A : Transcript L dash two one five . Professor B : O K . 
Query : Summarize the discussion on TORRENT schedule and intermediate categorization Professor B : Uh , the , uh , TORRENT chip . PhD A : Oh . Professor B : Yeah . We were two { disfmarker } we were { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . Professor B : Uh , uh , we went through it { disfmarker } Jim and I went through old emails at one point and { disfmarker } and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're { disfmarker } we 're two months away from being done . It was very { disfmarker } very believable schedules , too . I mean , we went through and { disfmarker } with the schedules { disfmarker } and we { disfmarker } PhD A : It was true for two years . Professor B : Yeah . Oh , yeah . It was very true . PhD A : So , should we just do the same kind of deal where we { pause } go around and do , uh , status report { pause } kind of things ? OK . And I guess when Sunil gets here he can do his last or something . So . Professor B : Yeah . So we { pause } probably should wait for him to come before we do his . PhD C : Mm - hmm . PhD A : OK . That 's a good idea . Professor B : Yeah . Grad F : OK . Professor B : Yeah . PhD A : Any objection ? Do y OK , M Professor B : All in favor PhD A : Do you want to start , Morgan ? Do you have anything , or { disfmarker } ? Professor B : Uh , I do n't do anything . I { disfmarker } No , I mean , I { disfmarker } I 'm involved in discussions with { disfmarker } with people about what they 're doing , but I think they 're { disfmarker } since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves . Grad F : OK . So should I go so that , uh , PhD A : Yeah . Why do n't you go ahead , Barry ? Grad F : you 're gon na talk about Aurora stuff , per se ? PhD A : OK . Grad F : OK . Um . Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my { disfmarker } my proposal . So , um { disfmarker } Mmm . I just finished a section on , uh { disfmarker } on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , um , as a { disfmarker } as a middle step . And , um , I hope to { disfmarker } hope to get this , um { disfmarker } a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan . PhD A : When is your , uh , meeting ? Grad F : Um , my meeting PhD A : Yeah . Grad F : with , uh { disfmarker } ? Oh , oh , you mean the { disfmarker } the quals . PhD A : The quals . Yeah . Grad F : Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth . PhD A : Oh . Soon . Grad F : Yeah . PhD A : Uh - huh . Grad F : D - Day . PhD A : Yeah . Grad F : Uh - huh . PhD A : So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and { disfmarker } ? Grad F : Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . And , um , and then , um { disfmarker } then everybody asks you questions . PhD A : Hmm . Grad F : Yeah . PhD A : I remember now . Grad F : Yep . So , um . PhD A : Have you d ? I was just gon na ask , do you want to say any { disfmarker } a little bit about it , Grad F : Y s PhD A : or { disfmarker } ? Mmm . Grad F : Oh . Uh , a little bit about { disfmarker } ? PhD A : Wh - what you 're { disfmarker } what you 're gon na { disfmarker } You said { disfmarker } you were talking about the , uh , particular features that you were looking at , Grad F : Oh , the { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } PhD A : or { disfmarker } Grad F : Right . Well , I was , um , I think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features { disfmarker } in intermediate categories to { disfmarker } to classify right away . But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with { disfmarker } with a reasonable set . Something { disfmarker } something like , um , um { disfmarker } like , uh , re regular phonetic features , just to { disfmarker } just to start off that way . And do some phone recognition . Um , build a system that , uh , classifies these , um { disfmarker } these feat uh , these intermediate categories using , uh , multi - band techniques . Combine them and do phon phoneme recognition . Look at { disfmarker } then I would look at the errors produced in the phoneme recognition and say , OK , well , I could probably reduce the errors if I included this extra feature or this extra intermediate category . That would { disfmarker } that would reduce certain confusions over other confusions . And then { disfmarker } and then { vocalsound } reiterate . Um , build the intermediate classifiers . Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new { disfmarker } or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again . PhD A : So you 're gon na use TIMIT ? 
Query : What did Grad F say about his proposal ? Grad F : OK . Um . Well , this past week I 've just been , uh , getting down and dirty into writing my { disfmarker } my proposal . So , um { disfmarker } Mmm . I just finished a section on , uh { disfmarker } on talking about these intermediate categories that I want to classify , um , as a { disfmarker } as a middle step . And , um , I hope to { disfmarker } hope to get this , um { disfmarker } a full rough draft done by , uh , Monday so I can give it to Morgan . PhD A : When is your , uh , meeting ? Grad F : Um , my meeting PhD A : Yeah . Grad F : with , uh { disfmarker } ? Oh , oh , you mean the { disfmarker } the quals . PhD A : The quals . Yeah . Grad F : Uh , the quals are happening in July twenty - fifth . PhD A : Oh . Soon . Grad F : Yeah . PhD A : Uh - huh . Grad F : D - Day . PhD A : Yeah . Grad F : Uh - huh . PhD A : So , is the idea you 're going to do this paper and then you pass it out to everybody ahead of time and { disfmarker } ? Grad F : Right , right . So , y you write up a proposal , and give it to people ahead of time , and you have a short presentation . And , um , and then , um { disfmarker } then everybody asks you questions . PhD A : Hmm . 
Query : What did Grad F think about intermediate categories ? Grad F : Right . Well , I was , um , I think one of the perplexing problems is , um , for a while I was thinking that I had to come up with a complete set of intermediate features { disfmarker } in intermediate categories to { disfmarker } to classify right away . But what I 'm thinking now is , I would start with { disfmarker } with a reasonable set .

Uh , do phoneme recognition . Look at the errors . And then postulate new { disfmarker } or remove , um , intermediate categories . And then do it again . PhD A : So you 're gon na use TIMIT ? Grad F : Um , for that { disfmarker } for that part of the { disfmarker } the process , yeah , I would use TIMIT . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : And , um , then { disfmarker } after { disfmarker } after , uh , um , doing TIMIT . Right ? PhD A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Um , that 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } that 's , um { disfmarker } that 's just the ph the phone recognition task . PhD A : Yeah . Grad F : Uh , I wanted to take a look at , um , things that I could model within word . So , I would mov I would then shift the focus to , um , something like Schw - Switchboard , uh , where I 'd { disfmarker } I would be able to , um { disfmarker } to model , um , intermediate categories that span across phonemes , PhD A : Mm - hmm . Grad F : not just within the phonemes , themselves , um , and then do the same process there , um , on { disfmarker } on a large vocabulary task like Switchboard . Uh , and for that { disfmarker } for that part I would { disfmarker } I 'd use the SRI recognizer since it 's already set up for { disfmarker } for Switchboard . And I 'd run some { disfmarker } some sort of tandem - style processing with , uh , my intermediate classifiers . 
Query : Summarize the discussion on mean subtraction in SRI Grad E : Oh . OK , sure . So , um , last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach . And , um , we { disfmarker } we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , um , { vocalsound } six percent to four point five percent , um , on the n on the far - mike data using PZM F , but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent . And , um , wh why would that be , um , { vocalsound } considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ? And so , uh , with some input from , uh , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts . Um , first of all HTK { disfmarker } sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation , and so HTK was n't . Um , so this , um { disfmarker } This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel { pause } normalization and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that would n't have been applied in the SRI case . And also , um , the { disfmarker } Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters . It 's got finer - grained acoustic models . So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts { pause } in the re - synthesized audio . Um . And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background . And so that seems like it could be difficult for training , cuz you could have { pause } different phones { pause } lined up with a different foreground phone , { vocalsound } um , { vocalsound } depending on { pause } the timing of the echo . So , um , I 'm gon na try training on a larger data set , and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them . So I 'm planning to use the Macrophone set of , um , read speech , and , um { disfmarker } Hmm . Professor B : I had another thought just now , which is , uh , remember we were talking before about { disfmarker } we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that { disfmarker } some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy { pause } sections ? Um , uh , if you { disfmarker } if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in { pause } late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a { disfmarker } an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values , and you got ta figure out what to do with them if you 're gon na continue treating this as a power spectrum . So , what { disfmarker } what Hirsch did was , uh , set them to zero { disfmarker } set the negative values to zero . So if you imagine a { disfmarker } a waveform that 's all positive , which is the time trajectory of energy , um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things . And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible . You know , you have the reverberation from higher - energy things showing up in { disfmarker } So in this case you have some artificially imposed { pause } reverberation - like thing . I mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation , but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in , uh , at n And , um , what if you did { disfmarker } ? I mean , there 's nothing to say that the { disfmarker } the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation . I mean , you also could , uh , just try to make it nicer . Grad E : Uh - huh . Professor B : And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor B : and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some { disfmarker } some , uh , very low or { disfmarker } or near zero { pause } value . I mean , uh , I 'm just saying if in fact it turns out that { disfmarker } that these echoes that you 're hearing are , uh { disfmarker } Grad E : Uh - huh . Professor B : or pre - echoes , whichever they are { disfmarker } are { disfmarker } are , uh , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them . Grad E : Uh - huh . Professor B : Be pretty simple . I mean , you do it in a pretty conservative way Grad E : OK . Professor B : so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to { pause } keep in an echo than to throw out speech . Grad E : Hmm . PhD G : Um , what is the reverberation time { pause } like { pause } there ? Grad E : In thi in this room ? Uh { disfmarker } PhD G : On , uh , the { disfmarker } the one what { disfmarker } the s in the speech that you are { disfmarker } you are using like ? Grad E : Y Yeah . I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I do n't know . Professor B : So , it 's this room . PhD G : It 's , uh { disfmarker } Professor B : It 's { disfmarker } it 's this room . PhD G : Oh , this room ? Professor B : So { disfmarker } PhD G : OK . Professor B : so it 's { disfmarker } these are just microphone { disfmarker } this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on . Grad F : Oh . Professor B : Uh , we should do a measurement in here . I g think we never have . I think it 's { disfmarker } I would guess , uh , point seven , point eight seconds f uh , R T Grad F : Hmm ! Professor B : something like that ? But it 's { disfmarker } you know , it 's this room . PhD G : Mm - hmm . Professor B : So . PhD G : OK . Mm - hmm . Professor B : Uh . But the other thing is , he 's putting in { disfmarker } w I was using the word `` reverberation `` in two ways . He 's also putting in , uh , a { disfmarker } he 's taking out some reverberation , but he 's putting in something , because he has { pause } averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds , which are then being subtracted from the speech . And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be { disfmarker } you 'll be subtracting from some larger number and sometimes you wo n't . And { disfmarker } PhD G : Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . Professor B : So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away . Uh , and if it 's a low { pause } energy compo portion , you might actually hear some { pause } funny things . PhD G : Yeah . Grad E : O o one thing , um , I noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized . So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is { pause } just as a kind of gain control ? Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you do n't amplify them . PhD C : Mm - hmm . I do n't see why { disfmarker } why your signal is louder after processing , because yo Grad E : Yeah . I do n't know why - y , uh , either . PhD C : Yeah . Professor B : I do n't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Oh , OK . Professor B : Yeah . I mean , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have { pause } better signal - to - noise ratio . PhD C : Well , well { disfmarker } Professor B : So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Professor B : But just it being bigger if { disfmarker } with the same signal - to - noise ratio { disfmarker } Grad E : It w i i it would n't affect things . Professor B : No . PhD C : Yeah . Grad E : OK . PhD C : Well , the system is { disfmarker } use { pause } the absolute energy , so it 's a little bit dependent on { disfmarker } on the { pause } signal level . But , not so much , I guess . Professor B : Well , yeah . But it 's trained and tested on the same thing . PhD C : Mmm . Professor B : So if the { disfmarker } if the { disfmarker } if you change { vocalsound } in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Yeah . PhD A : Did you add { pause } this data to the training set , for the Aurora ? Or you just tested on this ? Grad E : Uh { disfmarker } Um . Did I w what ? PhD A : Well , Morgan was just saying that , uh , as long as you do it in both training and testing , it should n't have any effect . Grad E : Sorry ? Yeah . PhD A : But I { disfmarker } I was { pause } sort of under the impression that you just tested with this data . Grad E : I { disfmarker } I b PhD A : You did n't { pause } train it also . Grad E : I { disfmarker } Right . I trained on clean TI - digits . I { disfmarker } I did the mean subtraction on clean TI - digits . But I did n't { disfmarker } I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder . Professor B : Oh , I see . Grad E : I only remember noticing it made the , um , PZM signal louder . Professor B : OK . Well , I do n't understand then . Yeah . Grad E : Huh . I do n't know . If it 's { disfmarker } if it 's { disfmarker } like , if it 's trying to find a { disfmarker } a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter . And then if you take it out { disfmarker } that taking it out makes things louder . I mean . Professor B : Uh , no . I mean , { vocalsound } uh , there 's { disfmarker } there 's nothing inherent about removing { disfmarker } if you 're really removing , Grad E : Nuh - huh . Professor B : uh , r uh , then I do n't { pause } see how that would make it louder . Grad E : The mean . OK . Yeah , I see . Professor B : So it might be just some { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah . OK . So I should maybe listen to that stuff again . Professor B : Yeah . It might just be some artifact of the processing that { disfmarker } that , uh , if you 're { disfmarker } Uh , yeah . I do n't know . Grad E : Oh . OK . PhD A : I wonder if there could be something like , uh { disfmarker } for s for the PZM data , PhD C : Eh PhD A : uh , you know , if occasionally , uh , somebody hits the table or something , you could get a spike . Uh . I 'm just wondering if there 's something about the , um { disfmarker } you know , doing the mean normalization where , uh , it { disfmarker } it could cause { pause } you to have better signal - to - noise ratio . Um . Professor B : Well , you know , there is this . Wait a minute . It { disfmarker } it { disfmarker } i maybe { disfmarker } i If , um { disfmarker } Subtracting the { disfmarker } the mean log spectrum is { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } is like dividing by the spectrum . So , depending what you divide by , if your { disfmarker } if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're { disfmarker } you 're { disfmarker } you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger . PhD A : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor B : So , it 's { disfmarker } it 's just a { disfmarker } a question of { disfmarker } there 's { disfmarker } It { disfmarker } it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing , or something to make it { disfmarker } Grad E : Mm - hmm . Professor B : Uh , y you 'd think it should n't be larger , but maybe in practice it is . That 's something to think about . Grad E : Hmm . Professor B : I do n't know . 
Query : What did the professor think about echoes and reverberation ? Professor B : I had another thought just now , which is , uh , remember we were talking before about { disfmarker } we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that { disfmarker } some of the other stuff that Avendano did , where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy { pause } sections ?

Query : What did PhD C think about the signal to noise ratio ? PhD C : Mm - hmm . I do n't see why { disfmarker } why your signal is louder after processing , because yo Grad E : Yeah . I do n't know why - y , uh , either . PhD C : Yeah . Professor B : I do n't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect . PhD C : Mm - hmm . Grad E : Oh , OK . Professor B : Yeah .

Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Project Manager : So Marketing : So { disfmarker } Project Manager : I hope you 're ready for this uh functional design meeting . Marketing : Of course . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . Um uh we want to know { disfmarker } to { disfmarker } at the end to know the new project 's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the { disfmarker } from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um third part { vocalsound } uh I do n't remember { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Project Manager : which is not very good . Ah of course , how to to design this uh this { disfmarker } Marketing : Nice stuff { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } yeah . So um let 's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert . Marketing : { vocalsound } Who starts ? { vocalsound } Oh . Ha . okay . Project Manager : So wait a minute . Mm . Marketing : So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ? So it 's being modified . Do you want { disfmarker } yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : So , um User Interface : Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh . Marketing : yeah , this is my name . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Sounds uh { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } We met before . Marketing : So as you know , you { disfmarker } I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please . Uh-oh . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm { vocalsound } uh . Industrial Designer : Yeah , it is put F_ five { gap } . Project Manager : Hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Hmm . Industrial Designer : The full page presentation , yep . Marketing : Yeah maybe in the full page Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : F_ F_ five . Marketing : because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yep . Project Manager : F_ five . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Uh-huh hmm okay . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Mm . Marketing : So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let 's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they do n't like and um and what they do with them by the way { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : because they are supposed to be useful . { vocalsound } Do n't forget about that . So we 've we 've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I 'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user do n't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . { vocalsound } Current remote controls as you know they 're the same as this one uh they 're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they 're all the same , and they 're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were { disfmarker } people are ready to pay for nice and look { disfmarker } and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in { disfmarker } and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it { disfmarker } the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . { vocalsound } Now { vocalsound } people are very frustrated w with their { vocalsound } remote controls Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : and they for instance uh they do n't even find it { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : it 's { vocalsound } it 's often lost somewhere in the in the { disfmarker } in your home and nobody knows where it is . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Agree . Marketing : Maybe if we have something where we could { vocalsound } ask the remote control please , where are you ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Like uh something to to { disfmarker } like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : but { vocalsound } you ca n't phone your { vocalsound } your remote control . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } You can { disfmarker } you are { gap } . Project Manager : Why not ? { vocalsound } Marketing : But why not ? Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : in fact they do n't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they do n't know how to { disfmarker } they { disfmarker } to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I do n't remember what is R_S_I_ . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay uh tha that 's look great . Marketing : { vocalsound } So I think they are bad . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } R_S_I_ mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I 'll check uh with my Industrial Designer : Yeah , it 's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect . Marketing : Oh , okay , User Interface : No , I do n't think so . Marketing : I think it 's a technical thing Industrial Designer : Yeah , Marketing : which our { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Okay . Marketing : Okay . User Interface : Okay . Industrial Designer : and those waves have high { disfmarker } Marketing : So , it seems that { vocalsound } it 's a lot of people for a concept that we do n't know { vocalsound } User Interface : But twenty six percent , do you know { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Or something we do n't know . { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh . User Interface : Twenty five . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh . Marketing : but we have to take this into account . User Interface : Every fourth , you know . { vocalsound } Every four { disfmarker } some of us knows . Industrial Designer : Yeah it 's { disfmarker } People really { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . Marketing : So anyway User Interface : One of us { disfmarker } Marketing : that 's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : what else do I have ? Next slide ? Ah yeah . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So we 've listed a couple of uh User Interface : Functions . Marketing : s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you { vocalsound } use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used { disfmarker } very often used and indeed uh very relevant . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Ah { vocalsound } now I remember what is R_S_I_ { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : it 's repetitivity stress injury . { vocalsound } We have to be careful with that word but { vocalsound } uh anyway Industrial Designer : Uh . Marketing : I continue my presentation so { disfmarker } yeah , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : channel selection is um very important , very often used . Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they 're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it 's average relevant at least , so . Project Manager : I have been told that we uh do n't consider teletext , that it 's out of date now because of internet . Marketing : I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were { disfmarker } had I think ten I think . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it 's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant . Project Manager : Mm-hmm User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : That 's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people do n't have that may be useful . For instance I think { disfmarker } net next slide . { vocalsound } One of the thing { disfmarker } the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility { disfmarker } the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you would n't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we 've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it 's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And uh as the age goes up { vocalsound } the { vocalsound } the relevance goes down . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? Industrial Designer : 'Cause { disfmarker } Marketing : I think if we are targeting young people then uh it 's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really do n't know why they { disfmarker } this should be so now Project Manager : Mm-mm . Okay . Marketing : this is of course , depends on that . And um I do n't have any conclusion , I did n't have time the meeting was very tight , so that 's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ? Project Manager : Mm I think it 's good , okay . You done a good review . User Interface : I got one question , Marketing : I can go back . Industrial Designer : Thank you . Marketing : Yeah one question , User Interface : uh you are a Market Expert Marketing : yeah ? User Interface : so Marketing : I am . { vocalsound } User Interface : should we aim at the young people or not ? Marketing : I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are { disfmarker } they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than { disfmarker } more than { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay , then teletext is used less . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Then teletext is useless for them I think , User Interface : Okay . Marketing : yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Project Manager : That 's good point . Marketing : But { disfmarker } yeah . Nope . Industrial Designer : Mm , yep . User Interface : Mm . Okay . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : 'Kay ? Industrial Designer : Thank you . Project Manager : So um now I think it 's the turn of the the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I 'm not sure um { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Of the technical function , so { vocalsound } uh Marketing : So I think it 's you , huh ? Industrial Designer : Uh it 's Marketing : No ? { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } That 's me . Project Manager : what effect { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : techni function of { disfmarker } Marketing : No , user requiremen Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Okay . Wait a second . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Argh . Industrial Designer : I have to do working design so uh Project Manager : So you 're { disfmarker } User Interface : That 's { disfmarker } but this but number three , yes . Mm-hmm . So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . Uh , as I 'm a more an artist Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : that 's gon na be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . Project Manager : Okay . Let 's go . User Interface : So next slide please . And uh a general method which is { disfmarker } seems to be very useful for our task Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use . Marketing : Makes sense . { vocalsound } User Interface : So , make a click , please . So here is this remote control . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : It 's quite a standard one , but it 's not from a T_V_ , it 's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } It 's { disfmarker } User Interface : which one would you prefer ? I guess this . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Marketing : I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh { disfmarker } I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button . User Interface : Sure , sure . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Maybe it can be yeah middle of { disfmarker } like , between those two User Interface : Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple Industrial Designer : li Project Manager : Oh sorry . { vocalsound } User Interface : simple desires into simple actions . Marketing : Nice . Nice sentence . User Interface : Findings . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Oh sorry . User Interface : Our question of the style , we should remember that our company Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Concept . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } S you should { disfmarker } yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Be simple . Be simple and you 'll lean on this market . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Market is a { disfmarker } of remote controls { disfmarker } you know it better , Marketing : Mm . User Interface : it 's very well , it 's it 's not an easy field to to play , you know ? So be simple . Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } User Interface : For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : It 's a really good style , it going to be { disfmarker } look like like this . It is unbreakable and it is very universal . W we 'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours , Marketing : Mm-hmm . User Interface : and we can put all the options into this screen . We 'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen . And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So { disfmarker } Press { disfmarker } Project Manager : { gap } User Interface : I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : I think , and uh what else ? I got just very few and good ideas . We need power and volume . And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ , Project Manager : It 's off . Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : It 's on . User Interface : the T_V_ turns on . Marketing : And when does it turn off ? User Interface : When you do n't touch the control but you go out of the { disfmarker } For for enough time Marketing : Oh so you have a User Interface : like uh you { disfmarker } Marketing : sensing { disfmarker } sensor machine that uh knows { disfmarker } User Interface : It 's a question to our technical design , our { vocalsound } two engineers . Industrial Designer : { gap } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Tech { vocalsound } User Interface : And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes . Project Manager : Or you want to go to the kitchen . { vocalsound } User Interface : It 's easy to do , Marketing : Mm-hmm . User Interface : you just control the { disfmarker } Marketing : According to your distance to { disfmarker } and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system . Industrial Designer : Distance . User Interface : According to the distance . { gap } Yeah yeah yeah . So { disfmarker } Marketing : Uh I 'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? Uh is it a touch screen by the way ? User Interface : I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . { gap } User Interface : So , its main purpose in fact is a back light , Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . User Interface : which change colours , Marketing : Okay . User Interface : which makes it easier to find , and each can { disfmarker } it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ? Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Okay . User Interface : So basically that 's it . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control . User Interface : Can be easily done , Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : 'cause you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions . Project Manager : Hmm . User Interface : Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } User Interface : Just few actions , a few actions for everything . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Hmm . S User Interface : All the rest , we sh we 'll put it into this menu on the screen . Project Manager : Mm . Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised { disfmarker } yeah . User Interface : Okay , okay . Industrial Designer : Mm . Yeah and it { disfmarker } mm . User Interface : Okay , but it 's quite universal you know . Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : We can just extend it to any device . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : So for instance if I want to go to { disfmarker } directly to channel twenty five , how would I do { disfmarker } can I do that with this ? User Interface : Uh twenty five . Marketing : Yeah mm let 's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : that 's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels . User Interface : { vocalsound } In fact I would propose another solution . Marketing : Or is it ? User Interface : Basically you use just four or five channels , right ? Marketing : Most people { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : yeah . User Interface : So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they 're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel . Marketing : In fact in in one uh remote control that I 've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button . Project Manager : Yeah it 's it 's the same solution , I think . Hmm . Marketing : I uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : B yeah . Industrial Designer : But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number Marketing : Go to channel twenty five . Industrial Designer : and then it go Marketing : One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap . Industrial Designer : t because { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : But still { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping . Project Manager : Yeah uh on zap it 's only next next next next next , yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : And it 's only next . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah User Interface : Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next . Marketing : so { disfmarker } but you have to { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . . User Interface : Or say this can be back . Industrial Designer : Yeah . But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press { disfmarker } suppose two five they just press two and five Marketing : So it would be { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : and then { disfmarker } Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : and you can change mode { disfmarker } zapping mode or Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Alright . Project Manager : uh current chan Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls Marketing : { vocalsound } Listening more . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : so we can have more functions for T_V_ Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Okay . User Interface : Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ? Marketing : Well I could could uh have a look at that { vocalsound } maybe . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } I 'll check in my department if there 's someone specialist in that . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Although I do n't know . { vocalsound } User Interface : Alright ? Thanks for your attention . Project Manager : Uh you 're finish ? Okay . So now { vocalsound } the technical aspects of this new device . Mm . Industrial Designer : Two . Yeah , if { disfmarker } { gap } Sorry . Project Manager : You prefer it { gap } . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh { disfmarker } like digital calculators and electronic calculators . { vocalsound } So now I 'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what { disfmarker } to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . { vocalsound } And usually this { disfmarker } so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages { disfmarker } these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It 's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device { gap } remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it 's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are { disfmarker } I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we 'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we 'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things . Project Manager : Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh . Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah , because the people do n't use one particular brand so Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that 's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I do n't have much time so I 'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you { disfmarker } can you make it on the whiteboard , or { disfmarker } mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sure , because since our User Interface { gap } speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser Project Manager : On { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh train it , okay . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : yeah , so that we just use simple recog Marketing : Mm-hmm . User Interface : { vocalsound } Too complex . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : no but but { disfmarker } Marketing : But uh very very good to sell . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . No , even in { disfmarker } you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah . Marketing : Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , User Interface : Okay . Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : and ha ha you can not use my remote control , Project Manager : Mm . { vocalsound } Marketing : because it 's targeted to me . Whatever . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : And what about the price of this component ? Industrial Designer : So { disfmarker } Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that , Project Manager : It mm { disfmarker } okay . Marketing : Hmm . Cheap . Industrial Designer : because we want to have uh millions and in bulk , Marketing : Millions . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : so we can make really simp Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : and we want to make really simple device Marketing : Cheap . Industrial Designer : because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : then we 'll have something like this um we 'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen . Marketing : The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : or or it will be something like volume , up , down . Industrial Designer : Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt { gap } volume and then { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : With a keywords and { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Mm-hmm mm . Industrial Designer : and and because we ca n't really say user to say same wording Marketing : Couple of words . Industrial Designer : then it become more mechanical and { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Um . Industrial Designer : And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we do n't know like users have different programmes , I mean they do n't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay . { gap } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : we do n't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else Marketing : Of course uh it has to be { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : because it will be complicated so we 'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem , Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : it 's it it will be take care of our main { disfmarker } mm . User Interface : No you know it 's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this { disfmarker } the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } But then I think you you { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : and and he 's coming { disfmarker } you know , he 's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . Project Manager : No , in no not only speech , yeah . Marketing : It 's on top of using the button . Project Manager : { vocalsound } I it 's an option . User Interface : Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros . Marketing : Well , I dunno . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this { gap } processor and { disfmarker } This really { gap } , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and { gap } like this key . User Interface : Okay . . Industrial Designer : So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control Marketing : T_V_ . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so { disfmarker } and we have only few things here { disfmarker } Project Manager : Sho to to train , okay . User Interface : Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Like , if I want to put volume up I like do { disfmarker } mm I take my remote control do like { disfmarker } something like Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : roll 'em up Industrial Designer : Um uh uh this point we did n't consider User Interface : or roll 'em down . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Very expensive , Industrial Designer : because it 's it 's very expensive Marketing : no ? Industrial Designer : because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros Project Manager : And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah . User Interface : Mm why ? Industrial Designer : and { disfmarker } User Interface : That 's just { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , Marketing : And volume control . Industrial Designer : even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it { disfmarker } different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they do n't touch the remote and mm y you do n't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off Marketing : So but uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : and { disfmarker } Marketing : Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yay yeah . Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they 're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I { disfmarker } Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : Would n't that make uh { vocalsound } arguments ? Industrial Designer : They can make { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , of course . Project Manager : I want uh { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Yeah we can have { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } That 's no problem , we will sell more . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } And we can increase this { vocalsound } the strength User Interface : { vocalsound } We got a really good Market Expert . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah exactly . Project Manager : { vocalsound } y you can buy one with { vocalsound } User Interface : Let 's send more , let 's sell more . Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh . Industrial Designer : Uh , not very much , Project Manager : No . Industrial Designer : like { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : Okay . Thanks . Project Manager : Okay , thanks . Industrial Designer : Thank you . Yep . Thank you . Project Manager : { vocalsound } So Industrial Designer : Can you just { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : mm Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : mm I think , okay , we 're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we 're now going to l have the lunch break . Marketing : Mm great . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um { vocalsound } we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um { disfmarker } on the components so { vocalsound } uh you will focus on the component concept um Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah . Project Manager : uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept Industrial Designer : Mark will { disfmarker } Project Manager : and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So { vocalsound } um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that 's all . And we have um maybe we have to { disfmarker } we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh I think automatic on off control uh it 's not possible . Industrial Designer : Uh it 's in current price , yeah . Marketing : Difficult . Project Manager : Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um . Industrial Designer : Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible . Project Manager : Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : And um do you see something else ? Marketing : No . User Interface : Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Speakers in the remote cont User Interface : Like , you want to find it , you shout Marketing : Oh yeah . Project Manager : Uh yeah User Interface : control , Project Manager : that 's { disfmarker } User Interface : and it answers is I 'm here ? Or { disfmarker } Marketing : It just beeps . User Interface : Just beeps ? Marketing : That would be enough . Project Manager : Or maybe you want to phone him . Marketing : Something very cheap . Project Manager : Since now all { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah yeah . Marketing : But that 's ex that 's expensive . Uh . Project Manager : yeah ? Think Industrial Designer : Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes Project Manager : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : because it should be all the time on and { disfmarker } Project Manager : And uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they { disfmarker } Project Manager : And it 's answered . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : because of the the frequency they they just answer to that . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : I ca n't whistle . No , no , I ca n't . Marketing : You ca n't whistle . Uh-huh . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ? Project Manager : Clap clap clap it 's a good { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Clap is good . Project Manager : I I think it 's universal . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Tak Project Manager : { vocalsound } What about people without hand ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay . Marketing : { vocalsound } Just a { vocalsound } suggestion . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah I think it 's good . Project Manager : Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } With only one hand ? { vocalsound } { vocalsound } These are not our target people . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm uh okay . Industrial Designer : But it 's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Okay . User Interface : Just do n't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Oh . Marketing : Oh that 's e that already exists User Interface : Yeah , I got it at my home , like { gap } { vocalsound } . Marketing : okay okay . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Oh yeah , you do have . User Interface : Oops . Industrial Designer : Ah it 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Wow . You 're trendy . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm , so { vocalsound } let 's to think s so that { disfmarker } Marketing : Think about it . Project Manager : yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh . Marketing : Yeah , okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : It { disfmarker } yes . { vocalsound } Okay . Marketing : Okay . Good Project Manager : So , Marketing : we 're done ? Project Manager : yeah , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : let 's go to lunch . Industrial Designer : Thank you , thank you very much . Marketing : Right , thanks . Project Manager : { gap } 
Query : Summarize the discussion about user requirements . Marketing : So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let 's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they do n't like and um and what they do with them by the way { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : because they are supposed to be useful . { vocalsound } Do n't forget about that . So we 've we 've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I 'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . And next please . Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user do n't like in remote controls . First of all , they find it very ugly . { vocalsound } Current remote controls as you know they 're the same as this one uh they 're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they 're all the same , and they 're not l good looking . Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were { disfmarker } people are ready to pay for nice and look { disfmarker } and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in { disfmarker } and effort in that um . And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it { disfmarker } the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . Um next please . { vocalsound } Now { vocalsound } people are very frustrated w with their { vocalsound } remote controls Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : and they for instance uh they do n't even find it { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : it 's { vocalsound } it 's often lost somewhere in the in the { disfmarker } in your home and nobody knows where it is . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Agree . Marketing : Maybe if we have something where we could { vocalsound } ask the remote control please , where are you ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Like uh something to to { disfmarker } like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : but { vocalsound } you ca n't phone your { vocalsound } your remote control . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } You can { disfmarker } you are { gap } . Project Manager : Why not ? { vocalsound } Marketing : But why not ? Yeah . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : in fact they do n't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they do n't know how to { disfmarker } they { disfmarker } to use properly their r remote controls . And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I do n't remember what is R_S_I_ . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay uh tha that 's look great . Marketing : { vocalsound } So I think they are bad . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } R_S_I_ mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I 'll check uh with my Industrial Designer : Yeah , it 's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect . Marketing : Oh , okay , User Interface : No , I do n't think so . Marketing : I think it 's a technical thing Industrial Designer : Yeah , Marketing : which our { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Okay . Marketing : Okay . User Interface : Okay . Industrial Designer : and those waves have high { disfmarker } Marketing : So , it seems that { vocalsound } it 's a lot of people for a concept that we do n't know { vocalsound } User Interface : But twenty six percent , do you know { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Or something we do n't know . { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh . User Interface : Twenty five . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh . Marketing : but we have to take this into account . User Interface : Every fourth , you know . { vocalsound } Every four { disfmarker } some of us knows . Industrial Designer : Yeah it 's { disfmarker } People really { vocalsound } { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . Marketing : So anyway User Interface : One of us { disfmarker } Marketing : that 's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : what else do I have ? Next slide ? Ah yeah . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : So we 've listed a couple of uh User Interface : Functions . Marketing : s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you { vocalsound } use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used { disfmarker } very often used and indeed uh very relevant . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Ah { vocalsound } now I remember what is R_S_I_ { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : it 's repetitivity stress injury . { vocalsound } We have to be careful with that word but { vocalsound } uh anyway Industrial Designer : Uh . Marketing : I continue my presentation so { disfmarker } yeah , User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : channel selection is um very important , very often used . Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . All of them . they 're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it 's average relevant at least , so . Project Manager : I have been told that we uh do n't consider teletext , that it 's out of date now because of internet . Marketing : I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were { disfmarker } had I think ten I think . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : Not very relevant , so if if there are good reason not to put teletext it 's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant . Project Manager : Mm-hmm User Interface : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : That 's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people do n't have that may be useful . For instance I think { disfmarker } net next slide . { vocalsound } One of the thing { disfmarker } the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility { disfmarker } the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you would n't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . So we 've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it 's a buzz word , find it very relevant . And uh as the age goes up { vocalsound } the { vocalsound } the relevance goes down . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? Industrial Designer : 'Cause { disfmarker } Marketing : I think if we are targeting young people then uh it 's probably something we have to consider . If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really do n't know why they { disfmarker } this should be so now Project Manager : Mm-mm . Okay . Marketing : this is of course , depends on that . And um I do n't have any conclusion , I did n't have time the meeting was very tight , so that 's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ? Project Manager : Mm I think it 's good , okay . You done a good review . User Interface : I got one question , Marketing : I can go back . Industrial Designer : Thank you . Marketing : Yeah one question , User Interface : uh you are a Market Expert Marketing : yeah ? User Interface : so Marketing : I am . { vocalsound } User Interface : should we aim at the young people or not ? Marketing : I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are { disfmarker } they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than { disfmarker } more than { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay , then teletext is used less . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Then teletext is useless for them I think , User Interface : Okay . Marketing : yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Project Manager : That 's good point . Marketing : But { disfmarker } yeah . Nope . Industrial Designer : Mm , yep . User Interface : Mm . Okay . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : 'Kay ? Industrial Designer : Thank you . 
Query : What did the marketing learn about the functions that users often used when discussing user requirements ? Marketing : So we 've listed a couple of uh User Interface : Functions . Marketing : s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you { vocalsound } use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : People want to have a power button .

Project Manager : { vocalsound } 
Query : Why did the marketing think they should aim at young people ? Marketing : That 's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people do n't have that may be useful . For instance I think { disfmarker } net next slide . { vocalsound } One of the thing { disfmarker } the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility { disfmarker } the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you would n't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want .

Query : Summarize the discussion about technical function design . Project Manager : So um now I think it 's the turn of the the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } I 'm not sure um { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Of the technical function , so { vocalsound } uh Marketing : So I think it 's you , huh ? Industrial Designer : Uh it 's Marketing : No ? { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } That 's me . Project Manager : what effect { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : techni function of { disfmarker } Marketing : No , user requiremen Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Okay . Wait a second . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Argh . Industrial Designer : I have to do working design so uh Project Manager : So you 're { disfmarker } User Interface : That 's { disfmarker } but this but number three , yes . Mm-hmm . So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . Uh , as I 'm a more an artist Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : that 's gon na be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . Project Manager : Okay . Let 's go . User Interface : So next slide please . And uh a general method which is { disfmarker } seems to be very useful for our task Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use . Marketing : Makes sense . { vocalsound } User Interface : So , make a click , please . So here is this remote control . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : It 's quite a standard one , but it 's not from a T_V_ , it 's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } It 's { disfmarker } User Interface : which one would you prefer ? I guess this . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Marketing : I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh { disfmarker } I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button . User Interface : Sure , sure . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Maybe it can be yeah middle of { disfmarker } like , between those two User Interface : Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple Industrial Designer : li Project Manager : Oh sorry . { vocalsound } User Interface : simple desires into simple actions . Marketing : Nice . Nice sentence . User Interface : Findings . Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Oh sorry . User Interface : Our question of the style , we should remember that our company Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Concept . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } S you should { disfmarker } yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } Be simple . Be simple and you 'll lean on this market . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } User Interface : Market is a { disfmarker } of remote controls { disfmarker } you know it better , Marketing : Mm . User Interface : it 's very well , it 's it 's not an easy field to to play , you know ? So be simple . Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } User Interface : For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : It 's a really good style , it going to be { disfmarker } look like like this . It is unbreakable and it is very universal . W we 'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours , Marketing : Mm-hmm . User Interface : and we can put all the options into this screen . We 'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen . And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So { disfmarker } Press { disfmarker } Project Manager : { gap } User Interface : I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : I think , and uh what else ? I got just very few and good ideas . We need power and volume . And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ , Project Manager : It 's off . Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : It 's on . User Interface : the T_V_ turns on . Marketing : And when does it turn off ? User Interface : When you do n't touch the control but you go out of the { disfmarker } For for enough time Marketing : Oh so you have a User Interface : like uh you { disfmarker } Marketing : sensing { disfmarker } sensor machine that uh knows { disfmarker } User Interface : It 's a question to our technical design , our { vocalsound } two engineers . Industrial Designer : { gap } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Tech { vocalsound } User Interface : And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes . Project Manager : Or you want to go to the kitchen . { vocalsound } User Interface : It 's easy to do , Marketing : Mm-hmm . User Interface : you just control the { disfmarker } Marketing : According to your distance to { disfmarker } and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system . Industrial Designer : Distance . User Interface : According to the distance . { gap } Yeah yeah yeah . So { disfmarker } Marketing : Uh I 'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? Uh is it a touch screen by the way ? User Interface : I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . { gap } User Interface : So , its main purpose in fact is a back light , Industrial Designer : Mm-hmm . User Interface : which change colours , Marketing : Okay . User Interface : which makes it easier to find , and each can { disfmarker } it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ? Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : Okay . User Interface : So basically that 's it . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control . User Interface : Can be easily done , Project Manager : Yeah . User Interface : 'cause you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions . Project Manager : Hmm . User Interface : Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } User Interface : Just few actions , a few actions for everything . Industrial Designer : Mm . Project Manager : Hmm . S User Interface : All the rest , we sh we 'll put it into this menu on the screen . Project Manager : Mm . Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised { disfmarker } yeah . User Interface : Okay , okay . Industrial Designer : Mm . Yeah and it { disfmarker } mm . User Interface : Okay , but it 's quite universal you know . Industrial Designer : Mm . User Interface : We can just extend it to any device . Industrial Designer : Mm . Marketing : So for instance if I want to go to { disfmarker } directly to channel twenty five , how would I do { disfmarker } can I do that with this ? User Interface : Uh twenty five . Marketing : Yeah mm let 's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Marketing : that 's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels . User Interface : { vocalsound } In fact I would propose another solution . Marketing : Or is it ? User Interface : Basically you use just four or five channels , right ? Marketing : Most people { disfmarker } User Interface : Yeah . Marketing : yeah . User Interface : So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they 're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel . Marketing : In fact in in one uh remote control that I 've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button . Project Manager : Yeah it 's it 's the same solution , I think . Hmm . Marketing : I uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : B yeah . Industrial Designer : But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number Marketing : Go to channel twenty five . Industrial Designer : and then it go Marketing : One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap . Industrial Designer : t because { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : But still { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping . Project Manager : Yeah uh on zap it 's only next next next next next , yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : And it 's only next . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Yeah User Interface : Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next . Marketing : so { disfmarker } but you have to { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . . User Interface : Or say this can be back . Industrial Designer : Yeah . But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press { disfmarker } suppose two five they just press two and five Marketing : So it would be { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : and then { disfmarker } Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : and you can change mode { disfmarker } zapping mode or Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Alright . Project Manager : uh current chan Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls Marketing : { vocalsound } Listening more . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : so we can have more functions for T_V_ Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Okay . User Interface : Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ? Marketing : Well I could could uh have a look at that { vocalsound } maybe . Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } I 'll check in my department if there 's someone specialist in that . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Although I do n't know . { vocalsound } User Interface : Alright ? Thanks for your attention . Project Manager : Uh you 're finish ? Okay . So now { vocalsound } the technical aspects of this new device . Mm . 
Query : What did the user interface designer recommend to do when discussing technical function design ? User Interface : For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : It 's a really good style , it going to be { disfmarker } look like like this .

Query : Summarize the discussion about how to select channels . Marketing : So for instance if I want to go to { disfmarker } directly to channel twenty five , how would I do { disfmarker } can I do that with this ? User Interface : Uh twenty five .

Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Although I do n't know . { vocalsound } User Interface : Alright ? Thanks for your attention . Project Manager : Uh you 're finish ? Okay . So now { vocalsound } the technical aspects of this new device . Mm . 
Query : Summarize the discussion about the working design of the remote control . Industrial Designer : Two . Yeah , if { disfmarker } { gap } Sorry . Project Manager : You prefer it { gap } . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh { disfmarker } like digital calculators and electronic calculators . { vocalsound } So now I 'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ . So we need to have some energy source to do what { disfmarker } to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . { vocalsound } And usually this { disfmarker } so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . And then these messages { disfmarker } these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . It 's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device { gap } remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it 's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are { disfmarker } I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . And then we 'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . Then we 'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things . Project Manager : Okay . To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh . Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah , because the people do n't use one particular brand so Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that 's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes . Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . Uh since I do n't have much time so I 'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you { disfmarker } can you make it on the whiteboard , or { disfmarker } mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sure , because since our User Interface { gap } speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser Project Manager : On { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh train it , okay . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : yeah , so that we just use simple recog Marketing : Mm-hmm . User Interface : { vocalsound } Too complex . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : no but but { disfmarker } Marketing : But uh very very good to sell . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . No , even in { disfmarker } you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah . Marketing : Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , User Interface : Okay . Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : and ha ha you can not use my remote control , Project Manager : Mm . { vocalsound } Marketing : because it 's targeted to me . Whatever . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : And what about the price of this component ? Industrial Designer : So { disfmarker } Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that , Project Manager : It mm { disfmarker } okay . Marketing : Hmm . Cheap . Industrial Designer : because we want to have uh millions and in bulk , Marketing : Millions . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : so we can make really simp Project Manager : Okay . Industrial Designer : and we want to make really simple device Marketing : Cheap . Industrial Designer : because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : then we 'll have something like this um we 'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen . Marketing : The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : or or it will be something like volume , up , down . Industrial Designer : Ye No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt { gap } volume and then { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : With a keywords and { disfmarker } yeah . Industrial Designer : yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Mm-hmm mm . Industrial Designer : and and because we ca n't really say user to say same wording Marketing : Couple of words . Industrial Designer : then it become more mechanical and { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Um . Industrial Designer : And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we do n't know like users have different programmes , I mean they do n't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay . { gap } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : we do n't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else Marketing : Of course uh it has to be { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : because it will be complicated so we 'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem , Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : it 's it it will be take care of our main { disfmarker } mm . User Interface : No you know it 's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this { disfmarker } the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up , Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } But then I think you you { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : and and he 's coming { disfmarker } you know , he 's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . Project Manager : No , in no not only speech , yeah . Marketing : It 's on top of using the button . Project Manager : { vocalsound } I it 's an option . User Interface : Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros . Marketing : Well , I dunno . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this { gap } processor and { disfmarker } This really { gap } , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s . User Interface : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and { gap } like this key . User Interface : Okay . . Industrial Designer : So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control Marketing : T_V_ . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so { disfmarker } and we have only few things here { disfmarker } Project Manager : Sho to to train , okay . User Interface : Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : Like , if I want to put volume up I like do { disfmarker } mm I take my remote control do like { disfmarker } something like Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : roll 'em up Industrial Designer : Um uh uh this point we did n't consider User Interface : or roll 'em down . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Very expensive , Industrial Designer : because it 's it 's very expensive Marketing : no ? Industrial Designer : because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros Project Manager : And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah . User Interface : Mm why ? Industrial Designer : and { disfmarker } User Interface : That 's just { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , Marketing : And volume control . Industrial Designer : even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it { disfmarker } different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they do n't touch the remote and mm y you do n't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off Marketing : So but uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : and { disfmarker } Marketing : Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yay yeah . Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they 're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I { disfmarker } Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : Would n't that make uh { vocalsound } arguments ? Industrial Designer : They can make { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , of course . Project Manager : I want uh { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Yeah we can have { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } That 's no problem , we will sell more . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } And we can increase this { vocalsound } the strength User Interface : { vocalsound } We got a really good Market Expert . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Marketing : Yeah exactly . Project Manager : { vocalsound } y you can buy one with { vocalsound } User Interface : Let 's send more , let 's sell more . Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh . Industrial Designer : Uh , not very much , Project Manager : No . Industrial Designer : like { disfmarker } yeah . Marketing : Okay . Thanks . Project Manager : Okay , thanks . Industrial Designer : Thank you . Yep . Thank you . Project Manager : { vocalsound } So Industrial Designer : Can you just { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : mm Industrial Designer : { gap } Project Manager : mm I think , okay , we 're just on time . Um mm mm . So , we 're now going to l have the lunch break . Marketing : Mm great . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um { vocalsound } we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um { disfmarker } on the components so { vocalsound } uh you will focus on the component concept um Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah . Project Manager : uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept Industrial Designer : Mark will { disfmarker } Project Manager : and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching . So { vocalsound } um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . Well I think that 's all . And we have um maybe we have to { disfmarker } we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh I think automatic on off control uh it 's not possible . Industrial Designer : Uh it 's in current price , yeah . Marketing : Difficult . Project Manager : Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um . Industrial Designer : Yeah . But speech recogniser can be possible . Project Manager : Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : And um do you see something else ? Marketing : No . User Interface : Uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ? Marketing : { vocalsound } Speakers in the remote cont User Interface : Like , you want to find it , you shout Marketing : Oh yeah . Project Manager : Uh yeah User Interface : control , Project Manager : that 's { disfmarker } User Interface : and it answers is I 'm here ? Or { disfmarker } Marketing : It just beeps . User Interface : Just beeps ? Marketing : That would be enough . Project Manager : Or maybe you want to phone him . Marketing : Something very cheap . Project Manager : Since now all { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah yeah yeah . Marketing : But that 's ex that 's expensive . Uh . Project Manager : yeah ? Think Industrial Designer : Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes Project Manager : Uh-huh . Industrial Designer : because it should be all the time on and { disfmarker } Project Manager : And uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they { disfmarker } Project Manager : And it 's answered . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : because of the the frequency they they just answer to that . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : I ca n't whistle . No , no , I ca n't . Marketing : You ca n't whistle . Uh-huh . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : Or a clap . You can clap . Can you ? Project Manager : Clap clap clap it 's a good { disfmarker } User Interface : Mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Clap is good . Project Manager : I I think it 's universal . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Tak Project Manager : { vocalsound } What about people without hand ? User Interface : { vocalsound } Okay . Marketing : { vocalsound } Just a { vocalsound } suggestion . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah I think it 's good . Project Manager : Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } With only one hand ? { vocalsound } { vocalsound } These are not our target people . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm uh okay . Industrial Designer : But it 's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Okay . User Interface : Just do n't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Oh . Marketing : Oh that 's e that already exists User Interface : Yeah , I got it at my home , like { gap } { vocalsound } . Marketing : okay okay . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : Oh yeah , you do have . User Interface : Oops . Industrial Designer : Ah it 's { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : Wow . You 're trendy . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Mm-hmm , so { vocalsound } let 's to think s so that { disfmarker } Marketing : Think about it . Project Manager : yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh . Marketing : Yeah , okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : It { disfmarker } yes . { vocalsound } Okay . Marketing : Okay . Good Project Manager : So , Marketing : we 're done ? Project Manager : yeah , Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : let 's go to lunch . Industrial Designer : Thank you , thank you very much . Marketing : Right , thanks . Project Manager : { gap } 
Query : What did the group discuss about speech recognition ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , I 'm sure , because since our User Interface { gap } speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : so Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . Project Manager : Mm .

Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : yeah , so that we just use simple recog Marketing : Mm-hmm . User Interface : { vocalsound } Too complex . Marketing : { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : no but but { disfmarker } Marketing : But uh very very good to sell . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . No , even in { disfmarker } you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah . Marketing : Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , User Interface : Okay . Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : and ha ha you can not use my remote control , Project Manager : Mm . { vocalsound } Marketing : because it 's targeted to me . Whatever . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . 
Query : What was the final decision of the discussion about automatic power control ? Project Manager : And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah . User Interface : Mm why ? Industrial Designer : and { disfmarker } User Interface : That 's just { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , Marketing : And volume control . Industrial Designer : even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it { disfmarker } different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they do n't touch the remote and mm y you do n't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off Marketing : So but uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : and { disfmarker } Marketing : Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yay yeah . Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they 're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I { disfmarker } Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : Would n't that make uh { vocalsound } arguments ? Industrial Designer : They can make { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , of course . Project Manager : I want uh { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Yeah we can have { disfmarker } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } That 's no problem , we will sell more . { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } And we can increase this { vocalsound } the strength User Interface : { vocalsound } We got a really good Market Expert . Project Manager : Uh I think automatic on off control uh it 's not possible . Industrial Designer : Uh it 's in current price , yeah . Marketing : Difficult . Project Manager : Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um . 
Query : What was the general discussion ? Grad F : Test . Postdoc G : OK . Professor B : Let 's see , I should be Two . PhD D : Up high { disfmarker } Grad E : As close to your mouth as you can get it . Professor B : La PhD D : high as you can get . Professor B : Is this channel one ? Postdoc G : Yeah , on your upper lip . PhD H : Channel one one one . Professor B : Gee , OK . Yes . OK . Grad E : OK , so for { disfmarker } for { disfmarker } For people wearing the wireless mikes , like { disfmarker } like this one , I find the easiest way to wear it is sorta this { disfmarker } this sorta like that . PhD H : This is { disfmarker } chan channel channel one one two three Grad F : Channel five , channel five . Professor B : Yeah . Mm - hmm . What do you do , Grad E : It 's actually a lot more comfortable then if you try to put it over your temples , Grad F : Test , test test . Professor B : you do it higher ? Grad E : so { disfmarker } Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD D : Adam 's just trying to generate good uh data for the recognizer there . Postdoc G : Yeah , I think we 're supposed to { disfmarker } that 's right . Grad E : And then also , for { disfmarker } for all of them , if your boom is adjustable , the boom should be towards the corner of your mouth , Grad F : Test test . PhD A : By the way , there was a bug . Yeah , i it was n't using the proper PhD D : Oh it was . Grad E : and about a uh a thumb to a thumb and a half distance away from your mouth , PhD A : basically it was n't adapting anything . PhD D : Oh . Grad E : so about like I 'm wearing it now . PhD D : Oh that 's interesting . So why did n't you get the same results and the unadapted ? Grad E : so so Jane , you could actually do even a little closer to your mouth , PhD H : It 's not always possible . PhD A : Hmm ? PhD D : Why did n't you get the same results and the unadapted ? Postdoc G : I could { disfmarker } can this be adjuste like this ? Grad E : but { disfmarker } PhD A : Oh , because when it estimates the transformer pro produces like a single matrix or something . Grad E : Yep . Postdoc G : Is that @ @ ? OK , thank you . Grad F : Adam , I 'm not { disfmarker } PhD D : O Oh oh I see . Grad F : uh , looks kinda low on channel five { disfmarker } PhD D : I see , I see . Professor B : OK . Grad F : no ? Grad E : Channel five , s speak again . Grad F : Maybe not . Postdoc G : Hello . PhD A : Basically there were no counts Grad E : Yeah , that 's alright . Grad F : Hello ? Grad E : I mean , we could { disfmarker } we could up the gain slightly if you wanted to . Grad F : It 's OK ? PhD H : Yeah . Grad F : Is this OK ? PhD H : OK . PhD D : I see what you mean . PhD C : Who 's channel B ? Grad E : but { disfmarker } Uh , channel B is probably Liz . PhD C : Uh oh . PhD H : Uh channel B { disfmarker } I am channel B . Professor B : You wan na close this , Postdoc G : Channel eight , eight . Professor B : or PhD C : No I Grad E : Thank you . PhD H : No , channel B . PhD A : Hello , hello . PhD C : yeah , yeah , you 're channel B . PhD H : Yeah , yeah . PhD C : So can you talk a bit ? I thought it might be too PhD H : OK , yeah , channel B , one two three four five . PhD C : OK . Grad E : Yeah , it 's alright . So , the gain is n't real good . Professor B : We 're recording , PhD C : OK . Professor B : right ? Grad E : OK , so we are recording . PhD H : Ah . Professor B : Yeah . PhD A : OK . Grad E : Um everyone should have at least two forms possibly three in front of you depending on who you are . Grad F : Oh . Grad E : Um we { disfmarker } we 're doing a new speaker form and you only have to spea fill out the speaker form once but everyone does need to do it . And so that 's the name , sex , email , et cetera . PhD H : Mm - hmm . Grad E : We { disfmarker } we had a lot of discussion about the variety of English and so on so if you do n't know what to put just leave it blank . Um I { disfmarker } I designed the form and I do n't know what to put for my own region , PhD A : Mmm . Grad E : so PhD D : California . PhD A : I think { disfmarker } Grad E : California . PhD H : California . PhD A : Um may I make one suggestion ? Instead of age put date of { disfmarker } uh year of birth Grad E : Sure . PhD A : because age will change , but The year of birth changes , you know , stays the same , usually . Grad E : Oh . PhD C : A actually , wait a minute , Grad E : Birth year ? Postdoc G : Although on { disfmarker } PhD A : Yeah . PhD C : should n't it be the other way around ? PhD D : Not for me . Postdoc G : course on the other { disfmarker } on the other hand you could { disfmarker } you view it as the age at the time of the { disfmarker } PhD C : On the other side , PhD A : Well the thing is , if ten years from now you look at this form knowing that { disfmarker } PhD C : yeah . Postdoc G : Yes , but what we care about is the age at { disfmarker } at the recording date rather than the { disfmarker } PhD C : O yeah . PhD D : But there 's no other date on the form . PhD C : W we do n't care how they { disfmarker } old they really are . PhD A : Well { disfmarker } well I do n't know . Postdoc G : Yes . { vocalsound } Unless we wan na send them a card . Grad E : Well I guess it depends on how long the corpus is gon na be collected for . PhD A : Anyway . Postdoc G : Yeah , that 's true . PhD C : I still do n't see the problem . Grad E : Either way yeah I think { disfmarker } I think age is alright PhD A : OK . Grad E : and then um there will be attached to this a point or two these forms uh so that you 'll be able to extract the date off that PhD A : Mm - hmm . Grad E : so , anyway . And so then you also have a digits form which needs to be filled out every time , the speaker form only once , the digit form every time even if you do n't read the digits you have to fill out the digits form so that we know that you were at the meeting . OK ? And then also if you have n't filled one out already you do have to fill out a consent form . And that should just be one person whose name I do n't know . OK ? Grad F : Do you want this { pause } Adam ? Grad E : Uh sure . Thank you . Professor B : So uh Grad E : OK so should we do agenda items ? Professor B : Uh oh that 's a good idea . I should n't run the meeting . Grad E : Uh well I have { disfmarker } I wan na talk about new microphones and wireless stuff . Postdoc G : Mmm . Grad E : And I 'm sure Liz and Andreas wan na talk about recognition results . Anything else ? PhD C : I guess { disfmarker } what time do we have to leave ? Three thirty ? PhD A : Yeah . PhD C : Yeah , Grad E : Why do n't you go first then . PhD C : so . Professor B : Yeah , good idea . PhD A : OK . PhD C : Um Well , I { disfmarker } I sent out an email s couple hours ago so um with Andreas ' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation , no cross - word models , no trigrams { disfmarker } a bigram recognizer and that 's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations . Um and thanks to Don 's help wh who { disfmarker } Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed and um { vocalsound } you know separated { disfmarker } used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used and uh Don sampled that so { disfmarker } so eight K um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes , up to synch time of one two zero zero so is that { disfmarker } that 's twenty minutes or so ? Um yeah because I guess there 's some , Grad E : Or so . PhD C : and Don can talk to Jane about this , there 's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh I 'm { disfmarker } we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier . Anyway so it 's twenty minutes and I actually Grad E : Hmm . PhD C : um Grad E : I { disfmarker } was that { disfmarker } did that { disfmarker } did that recording have the glitch in the middle ? Postdoc G : I 'm puzzled by that . I { disfmarker } oh { disfmarker } oh , I see . PhD C : There 's { disfmarker } there 's a { disfmarker } Postdoc G : Oh there was a glitch somewhere . PhD C : yeah , so that actually um Grad F : Was it twenty minutes in , PhD C : if it was twenty minutes in then I do n't know Postdoc G : I forgot about that . Grad F : I thought { disfmarker } PhD A : Well it was interesting , Postdoc G : Well , I mean , they { disfmarker } PhD A : suddenly { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent Grad E : I do n't remember when it is . Postdoc G : but I was able to can transcribe PhD A : but i looking at { disfmarker } the first sentences looked much better than that and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the { disfmarker } it was actually recognized PhD C : Wel Grad E : Oh no . Grad F : Yeah , that might be { disfmarker } that might be { disfmarker } that might be my fault . Postdoc G : Wow . PhD A : so Grad E : Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch . Grad F : I 'm not { disfmarker } PhD A : OK . PhD C : No actually it was { disfmarker } yeah i it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so um Grad F : yeah , I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time , Postdoc G : Oh . That 's not good . PhD C : Yeah PhD A : OK . PhD C : so that 's what we have Grad E : Alright . Grad F : so PhD C : but that { disfmarker } that will be completely gone if this synch time problem Postdoc G : Yeah . Grad E : The { disfmarker } the glitch PhD A : So { disfmarker } so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to Postdoc G : And the only glitch { disfmarker } Grad E : yeah . Postdoc G : yeah . PhD C : So you guys know . Professor B : S sorry I have n't seen the email , PhD C : Yeah . Grad E : Th - the Postdoc G : The { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } well { disfmarker } wait Professor B : what was the score ? PhD C : So here 's the actual copy of the email Postdoc G : we should say something about the glitch . He { disfmarker } he can say something about the glitch . PhD C : um oh OK Grad E : yeah . Postdoc G : Cuz it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } h it 's { disfmarker } it 's very small { disfmarker } PhD C : so does this glitch occur at other { disfmarker } Grad E : There { disfmarker } there { disfmarker } there 's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized Postdoc G : very small . Yep . PhD C : Oh . PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : Right . Grad E : so the { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second Professor B : Hmm . Grad F : Hmm . Grad E : and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there 's a little part where it starts doing { disfmarker } doing click sounds . Professor B : So { disfmarker } PhD C : And is it only once that that happens ? Grad E : But yeah PhD C : OK . Grad E : it { disfmarker } right once in the middle . PhD C : There 's { disfmarker } the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong Professor B : so { disfmarker } so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice , PhD C : but Grad E : Um But that should n't affect anything PhD C : OK so that 's actually Postdoc G : S and it { disfmarker } Professor B : you see this here ? PhD C : It { disfmarker } y it 's { disfmarker } Grad E : yeah yeah `` bah `` PhD C : OK no { disfmarker } PhD A : Oh , and { disfmarker } PhD C : What happens is it actually affects the script that Don { disfmarker } PhD D : Huh . PhD C : I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it Grad E : Well the acoustic one should n't do anything . PhD C : but they Grad F : Yeah , I do n't know exactly what affected it Postdoc G : I agree . I agree . PhD A : I { disfmarker } I have { disfmarker } Grad F : but I 'll { disfmarker } I 'll talk to you about it , PhD A : Yeah . Grad E : But I { disfmarker } I do remember { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . Grad F : I 'll show you the point . Postdoc G : Yeah . It { disfmarker } it had no effect on my transcription , PhD A : Mmm . Postdoc G : you know , I mean I { disfmarker } I had no trouble hearing it and { disfmarker } and having time bins Grad E : I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect . Postdoc G : but there was a { disfmarker } Oh . PhD C : Well , the { disfmarker } the synch time { disfmarker } the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should , Grad F : That 's what happened . Postdoc G : Oh . PhD H : Yeah . Grad E : Where { disfmarker } where they were n't monotonic . Grad F : There was { disfmarker } yeah , I mean { disfmarker } PhD C : right ? There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame . PhD H : Yeah . Postdoc G : Oh , interesting . PhD C : And so then , I mean you look at that and it 's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that ca n't be right Grad E : Oh OK so that 's Grad F : Hmm . Postdoc G : Oh . PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : so anyway it 's { disfmarker } it 's just { disfmarker } Grad E : yeah sounds like a bug . Postdoc G : Yeah . PhD C : that 's why we only have twenty minutes but there 's a significant amount of { disfmarker } Grad F : Non - zero ? Um there are like more { disfmarker } cuz there 's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran , Grad E : The other one I saw was that it yeah . Grad F : I mean but there were there was a point . PhD C : Yeah that was fine . That { disfmarker } that was OK . Grad E : The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times Grad F : OK . Grad E : and that definitely indicra indicates a bug . Grad F : Uh . PhD C : Well that would really be a problem , yeah . So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting . Grad F : Yeah . PhD C : um and what 's { disfmarker } which { disfmarker } Grad E : So that 's very encouraging . PhD C : this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition , Professor B : Hmm . PhD H : Yeah . Professor B : Cool . PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : there 's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different so you can see some like this Trent Lott which PhD D : Trent Lott . PhD C : um I mean these are sort of funny ones , PhD D : It 'll get those though . PhD C : there 's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references , I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see Grad E : I and as I said I would like to look at the lattices PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : but um it 's pretty good . Grad E : because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right ? PhD C : Well so I guess we can generate Grad E : Sounds likes ? PhD A : There are a fair number of errors that are , you know where { disfmarker } got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong . Postdoc G : Mm - hmm . PhD C : um Grad E : Yeah , and who cares ? And { disfmarker } and there were lots of { disfmarker } of course the `` uh uh `` - s , `` in on `` - s `` of uh `` - s . PhD A : Mmm , so if { disfmarker } PhD C : there 's { disfmarker } No those are actually PhD A : Yeah . PhD C : a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary , PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : so is it like PZM is three words , it 's PZM , PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : I mean there 's nothing There 's no language model for PZM or Grad E : Right . Ri - ri right . PhD C : um Grad E : Did you say there 's no language for PZM ? PhD C : No language model , I mean those { disfmarker } Grad E : Do you mean { disfmarker } so every time someone says PZM it 's an error ? Maybe we should n't say PZM in these meetings . PhD C : Well { disfmarker } well there 's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet and I mean um anyway there { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah , that 's right , Jimlet . Professor B : Well , we do n't even know what that means , PhD C : so { vocalsound } but this is really encouraging because Professor B : so I Grad E : Yeah , that 's right . PhD C : so , I mean the bottom line is even though it 's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of { disfmarker } of r reasonable s you know Switchboard this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained { disfmarker } mostly trained recognizer Grad E : Right . PhD C : and Switchboard - two is { disfmarker } got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic Grad E : Excellent . PhD C : and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one so there was @ @ so that 's great . Professor B : Yeah . Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did { disfmarker } had the ninety - three workshop PhD C : Um Professor B : and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : Oh yeah Professor B : you know PhD C : I mean this is really , PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : and thanks to Andreas who , I mean this is a PhD A : Mmm . Grad E : Well especially for the very first run , I mean you { disfmarker } PhD A : Oh it 's the { disfmarker } Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : eh um Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : yeah Grad E : the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error but PhD C : So and what al also this means is that Postdoc G : Right . PhD C : um Grad E : Not Switchboard , PhD A : Well it 's { disfmarker } PhD C : I mean there 's a bunch of things in this note to various people Grad E : uh Broadcast News . PhD C : especially I guess um with Jane that { disfmarker } that would help for { disfmarker } since we have this new data now uh in order to go from the transcripts more easily to um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring . I had to deal with some of it by hand but I think a lot of it can be automated s by { disfmarker } Professor B : Oh one thing I guess I did n't get so you know the language model was straight from { disfmarker } from bigram from Switchboard the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or { disfmarker } or PhD A : Yeah . PhD C : Yeah . Professor B : So they did n't have anything from this acoustic data in yet ? Postdoc G : That 's amazing . Grad E : Yeah , so that 's great . PhD C : No . Professor B : OK . PhD C : And actually { disfmarker } we actually um used Switchboard telephone bandwidth models Postdoc G : That 's amazing . PhD A : Well that 's { disfmarker } those are the only we ones there are , Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : which I guess PhD D : I was just gon na say , PhD C : so that 's the on that 's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of PhD D : yeah . PhD A : I mean Grad E : Yeah . PhD A : Right . PhD C : and I guess Ramana , so a guy at SRI said that um there 's not a huge amount of difference going from { disfmarker } Professor B : Right . PhD C : it 's { disfmarker } it 's not like we probably lose a huge amount but we wo n't know because we do n't have any full band models for s conversational speech . PhD D : It 's probably not as bad as going f using full band models on telephone band speech PhD C : So . PhD A : Oh yeah . PhD C : Right . PhD D : right ? PhD A : Yeah . Professor B : Yeah , PhD C : Right , so it 's { disfmarker } so Professor B : but for Broadcast News when we { disfmarker } we played around between the two there was n't a huge loss . Grad E : Right , it was not a big deal . PhD C : Yeah PhD A : I should { disfmarker } I should say that { disfmarker } the language model is not just Switchboard PhD C : so I wou so that 's good . Grad E : Although combining em worked well . PhD A : it 's also { disfmarker } I mean there 's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News but with a little less weight PhD C : Yeah . PhD A : uh because Professor B : Uh - huh . PhD C : Like Trent Lott must have been from PhD A : mm - hmm , right . PhD C : I guess { vocalsound } Switchboard was before PhD A : Um By the way just { disfmarker } for fun we also ran , PhD C : uh . Professor B : Good point . PhD A : I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD A : so just for the heck of it I ran that Grad E : And it said a hundred percent male ? PhD A : um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right . PhD C : The j PhD A : Yeah so Grad E : Oh it did ? Postdoc G : Oh that 's { disfmarker } I 'm glad . Grad E : It got all two genders ? PhD C : Yeah but you know Jane and Adam have you kn about equal performance PhD A : Yeah . Yes . PhD C : and uh and that 's interesting cuz I think the { disfmarker } their language models are quite different so and I { disfmarker } I 'm pretty sure from listening to Eric that , you know given the words he was saying and given his pronunciation that the reason that he 's so much worse is the lapel . Professor B : Yeah . Grad E : Right . Postdoc G : That makes a lot of sense , PhD C : So it 's nice now if we can just sort of eliminate the lapel one when { disfmarker } when we get new microphones Postdoc G : yeah . Very possible . Professor B : Yeah I { disfmarker } I { disfmarker } I would bet on that too PhD C : that would be worth it Professor B : cuz he certainly in that { disfmarker } when as a { disfmarker } as a burp user he was { disfmarker } he was a pretty uh strong one . PhD C : um Yeah Grad E : Sheep . PhD C : he { disfmarker } he { disfmarker } he sounded to me just from { disfmarker } he sounded like a , Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : what 's it a sheep or a goat ? Professor B : Sheep . Grad E : A sheep . PhD C : Sheep , Grad E : Baah . Professor B : Yeah . Sheep is good . PhD C : right . Sounded good . Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : Right so um so I guess the good news is that Postdoc G : Mm - hmm . PhD C : and { disfmarker } and again this is without a lot of the sort of bells and whistles that we c can do with the SRI system and we 'll have more data and we can also start to maybe adapt the language models once we have enough meetings . So this is only twenty minutes of one meeting with no { disfmarker } no tailoring at all . PhD A : I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better because the { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . The voca the vocabulary especially Grad E : Or just dictionary . PhD C : yeah . PhD A : Not that much the vocabulary actually PhD C : Yeah , so . PhD A : I think { disfmarker } um well we have to see but { disfmarker } it 's uh { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . It 's pretty good um so then Professor B : Have to add PZM and so on Grad E : And I have to try it on the far field mike Professor B : but PhD C : PZM Grad E : yeah . PhD C : and then there 's things like for the transcription I got when someone has a digit in the transcript I do n't know if they said , you know one one or eleven and I do n't know if they said Tcl or TCL . there 's things like that where , you know the um we 'll probably have to ask the transcribers to indicate some of those kinds of things but in general it was really good and I 'm hoping { disfmarker } and this is { disfmarker } this is good news because that means the force alignments should be good and if the force alignments , I mean it 's good news anyway but if the force alignments are good we can get all kinds of information . For example about , you know prosodic information and speaker overlaps and so forth directly from the aligned times . Um so that 'll be something that actually in order to assess the forced alignment um we need s some linguists or some people to look at it and say are these boundaries in about the right place . Because it 's just gon na give us time marks PhD D : But you know { disfmarker } Grad E : Well we 've done that for one meeting . PhD C : so . For forced alignment . Grad E : Uh oh oh f not for words PhD C : Ye - right . Grad E : I 'm sorry just for overlaps is we did it for not { disfmarker } not for words . PhD C : Right . So this would be like if you take the words um you know and force align them on all the individual close talk uh close talking mikes then how good are these sort of in reality Grad E : Right . PhD C : and then I was thinking it { disfmarker } Grad E : So we might want to take twenty minutes and do a closer word level transcription . Maybe actually mark the word boundaries . PhD C : Oh or { disfmarker } i have someone look at the alignments uh maybe a linguist who can say um you know roughly if these are OK and how far away they are . Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : Um but I think it 's got ta be pretty good because otherwise the word recognition would be really b crummy . Grad E : Right , right . PhD C : It would n't necessarily be the other way around , if the wor word recognition was crummy the alignment might be OK but if the word recognition is this good the alignment should be pretty good . So that 's about it . Professor B : I r PhD D : I wonder if this is a good thing or a bad thing though , I mean if we 're pr Grad E : That we 're starting so well ? PhD D : yeah if we 're producing a database that everybody 's gon na do well on Professor B : Oh Grad E : Do n't worry about it w d that 's that 's the close talking mikes . Try it on the P Z Ms and { disfmarker } and Professor B : Yeah , which { disfmarker } I would { disfmarker } which { disfmarker } well n n n n PhD D : So the real value of the database is these ? PhD H : Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . Grad E : Yeah , abso well no but Professor B : I mean there 's still just the w the percentages and , I mean they 're not { disfmarker } a as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps PhD C : This i yeah . This is not that good . Professor B : there 's probably overlaps in { disfmarker } in uh in fair number in Switchboard as well so but { disfmarker } but there 's other phenomena , it 's a meeting , it 's a different thing and there 's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes but uh yeah certainly I 'd like to see as soon as we could , I mean maybe get some of the glitches out of the way but soon as we could how well it does with say with the P Z Ms or maybe even one of the PhD C : Right . Professor B : and uh see if it 's , you know is it a hundred twenty percent or maybe it 's not maybe if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent or something and { disfmarker } and then if for the PZM it 's seventy or something like that that 's actually something we could sort of work with a little bit PhD C : Yeah . Professor B : so PhD C : No I think it 's really , I mean this way we least have a baseline we know that for instance the transcripts are very good so once you can get to the words that the recognizer which is a total subset of the things you need to understand the { disfmarker } the text um yeah they 're pretty good so and { disfmarker } and it 's converting automatically from the XML to the chopping up the wave forms and so forth it 's not the case that the end of one utterance is in the next segment and things like that which we had more problems with in Switchboard so that 's good . And um let 's see there was one more thing I wanted to { disfmarker } to mention { disfmarker } I ca n't remember um Sorry ca n't remember . anyway it 's { disfmarker } Postdoc G : Congratulations is really great . Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : well it was , I mean I really did n't do this myself Grad E : Yeah , it 's really good . PhD C : so Andreas set up this recognizer and { disfmarker } by the way the recognizer all the files I 'm moving to SRI and running everything there so I brought back just these result files and people can look at them um so PhD A : We { disfmarker } we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here . That 's { disfmarker } you know if { disfmarker } if there are more machines um uh here plus people can { disfmarker } could run their own uh you know variants of { disfmarker } of { disfmarker } of the recognition { pause } runs um certainly doable . Um . Professor B : Yeah and { disfmarker } well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training , yeah . PhD A : Yeah . Professor B : Seems reasonable . Postdoc G : I need t Hmm . I need to ask one question . PhD A : Yeah . Postdoc G : Which is um so this issue { vocalsound } of the uh legalistic aspects of the pre - sent you know pre - adapted { disfmarker } Yeah , well , so what I mean is um the { disfmarker } uh the data that you take into SRI , first { disfmarker } first question , you 're maintaining it in { disfmarker } in a place that would n't be publicly readable that { disfmarker } that kind of stuff , right ? PhD A : U um PhD C : From the outside world or Postdoc G : By uh people uh who are not associated with this project . PhD A : Oh . Grad E : It 's human subjects issues , I told you about that . PhD C : Um oh . Postdoc G : Exactly . PhD C : Well OK we have n no names . Although I sh um Grad E : That { disfmarker } that 's not the issue , PhD C : de audio data itself ? Grad E : it 's just the audio data itself , until people have a chance to edit it . Postdoc G : Mm - hmm , exactly . PhD C : Uh so well I can { disfmarker } I can protect my directories through there . Postdoc G : Yeah . PhD C : Right now they 're not { disfmarker } they 're in the speech group directories which { disfmarker } so I will { disfmarker } Postdoc G : Great . PhD C : I did n't know that actually . Professor B : Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions , PhD C : Yeah OK . Professor B : say it 's OK . PhD C : Right OK . Postdoc G : Yeah , we had to get them to approve em and then i cuz { disfmarker } cuz the other question I was gon na ask is if we 're having um you know it 's but this { disfmarker } this meeting that you have , no problem cuz I { disfmarker } I well I mean I { disfmarker } I speak for myself Grad E : It 's us . Postdoc G : but { disfmarker } but I think that we did n't do anything that but well anyway so { vocalsound } uh I would n't be too concerned about it with respect to that although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course but these results are based on data which have n't had the uh have n't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects PhD C : That 's true . Postdoc G : and I do n't know how that stands , I mean if you { disfmarker } if you get fantastic results and it 's involving { comment } data which { disfmarker } which later end up being lessened by , you know certain elisions , then I do n't know but I wanted to raise that issue , Professor B : Well we , Postdoc G : that 's all . Professor B : I mean once we get all this streamlined it may be sh it { disfmarker } hopefully it will be fairly quick but we get the transcriptions , people approve them and so on it 's just that we 're Grad E : Alright we need to work at a system for doing that approval so that we can send people the transcripts Postdoc G : Great . PhD A : Mmm . Postdoc G : Yeah . Grad E : and get back any bleeps that they want PhD C : Yeah actually the bleeps are also an issue I thought . Professor B : It 's gon na be a rare thing that there 's a bleep for the most part . PhD A : U uh actually I had a question about the downsampling , um I do n't know who , I mean how this was done but is { disfmarker } is there { disfmarker } are there any um { vocalsound } issues with downsampling PhD C : Don did this . PhD A : because I know that the recognizer um that we use h can do it sort of on the fly um so we would n't have to have it eh you know do it uh explicitly beforehand . And is there any um i are there other d sev uh is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another ? Grad F : There are lots of w { vocalsound } there are lots of ways to do the downsampling um different filters to put on , PhD A : OK . Right . OK . Grad F : like anti - aliasing stuff . PhD A : So { disfmarker } so the { disfmarker } th Grad E : I do n't think we even know which one I assume you 're using syncat to do it ? Grad F : No , I 'm using uh SN SND uh are resample . Grad E : Or sound resample ? PhD C : Re - re ref Grad E : Resample . PhD C : yeah . Grad E : Yeah and Dan 's archaic acronyms . Grad F : RSMP . Yeah , I do n't really . PhD C : Missing all the vowels . Grad F : I just { disfmarker } yeah I found it . PhD C : Some of the vowels , Grad E : Not all of them . PhD C : almost all the vowels , that 's the hard part . PhD A : So { disfmarker } so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms , Grad E : And a few of the consonants . PhD A : I mean segment them but not downsample them . PhD C : Yeah we could { disfmarker } we could try that and { disfmarker } and compare PhD A : And { disfmarker } and feed them to { disfmarker } feed them to the SRI recognizer and see if { disfmarker } if the SRI front - end does something . Grad F : Yeah , that 's { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . Grad E : I suspect that 's sort of premature optimization , but Sure . PhD C : We can try it . I { disfmarker } I only downsampled them first cuz I was PhD A : Well { disfmarker } Grad F : I mean that 's just one line { disfmarker } that 's one line of code to comment at PhD C : yeah PhD A : Right and { disfmarker } and it does n't { disfmarker } is no more work { vocalsound } for um you know for us . Grad F : so Grad E : Mm - hmm . Grad F : Yeah . PhD C : Well they 're just bigger to transfer , that 's why I s downsampled them before but PhD A : Well but they 're only twice as big so PhD C : Well I mean that was { disfmarker } if it 's the same then we can downsample here PhD A : I mean it 's { disfmarker } it 's just a PhD C : but if it 's { disfmarker } Grad F : Although those eighty meg files take a while to copy into my directories PhD C : Yeah . Grad F : so , but no , I mean it 's not { disfmarker } i it would n't be a problem if you 're interested in it { disfmarker } PhD C : We could try that . PhD A : Yeah I mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um you know Grad F : it would { disfmarker } PhD A : minus the transfer time it would { disfmarker } it would take uh you know ten minutes to try and { disfmarker } and { disfmarker } and Grad F : Yeah . Grad E : It 's about a fifty minute drive , right ? PhD A : And { disfmarker } and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why PhD C : Well it takes more disk space too so I was just { disfmarker } PhD A : and , you know , what { disfmarker } Yeah . Grad F : Mmm . In the front - end we could do that . PhD A : Yeah . Professor B : So you just train { disfmarker } just different filters Grad F : Yeah , I { disfmarker } Professor B : and so you 're just wondering whether the filter is Grad F : Yeah , I can imagine it would be { disfmarker } PhD A : Right . Right . PhD C : So we could try that with this particular twenty minutes of speech and sort of see if there 's any differences . Grad F : I mean I guess there 's some { disfmarker } PhD A : You know a at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance . Grad F : Hmm . PhD A : So in other words right , Professor B : Right . PhD A : so Grad E : It just seems to me that , you know small changes to the language model and the vocabulary will so swamp that that it may be premature to worry about that . I mean so one is a half a percent better than the other I do n't think that gives you any information . PhD C : Well it 's just as easy to { disfmarker } to give you the sixteen K individual , Grad E : Yep . PhD C : it was just more disk space you know for storing them Professor B : Are you { disfmarker } are you using uh uh mel cepstrum or PLP over there ? PhD C : so PhD A : Mel cepstrum . Professor B : So probably does n't matter . PhD C : Well we could try . Grad F : There 's { disfmarker } there 's your answer . Professor B : But { disfmarker } but it would n't hurt to try , PhD C : Could easily try PhD A : That 's what I would assume but you never know , Professor B : yeah . PhD C : so PhD A : you know . Professor B : Sure . No the reason I say this Postdoc G : Just { disfmarker } Mm - hmm . Professor B : PLP uses uh auto - regressive filtering and uh modeling and so it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you 're doing PhD A : Mm - hmm . Professor B : but uh uh mel cepstrum uh might not { disfmarker } b you would n't expect to be so much but PhD C : Well we can try it if you generate like the same set of files just up to that point where we stopped anyway and just sti stick them somewhere Grad F : Yeah , it 's { disfmarker } it 's really not a problem . PhD A : Actually , no . PhD C : and I 'll rerun it with PhD A : Do n't stop . Do n't stop at that part because we 're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters , Grad F : Keep going . Yeah . PhD A : so should n't use { disfmarker } you should s you know , get Grad F : Yeah , I mean I 'll { disfmarker } I have to do is eh e the reference file would stay the same , PhD C : OK . PhD A : Right . Grad F : it 's just the individual segments would be approximately twice as long PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : Right . Right . Grad F : and I could just replace them with the bigger ones in the directory , PhD A : Right . PhD C : I mean I corrected all { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah . Grad F : that 's not a problem . PhD C : I mean I hand - edited the whole { disfmarker } the whole meeting so that can be run it 's just { disfmarker } Once we get the { disfmarker } the bug out . PhD A : Mmm . Postdoc G : One { disfmarker } one question which is I { disfmarker } I had the impression { comment } from this { disfmarker } from this meeting that w that I transcribed that um that there was already automatic downsampling occurring , PhD A : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Postdoc G : is that I thought that in order to Grad E : Yep . Postdoc G : so it was { disfmarker } so it 's like there 's already down Grad E : There 's one level that 's already happening right here . Professor B : This is being recorded at forty - eight kilohertz . Which is more that anybody needs Postdoc G : OK . Grad E : Right . Grad F : Oh . Grad E : And it gets downsampled to sixteen . Postdoc G : OK . Professor B : so PhD C : And that 's actually said in your meeting , Grad F : Hmm . Postdoc G : Oh OK . PhD C : that 's how I know that . Postdoc G : That 's exactly , and that 's how I know it . Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : I { disfmarker } I { vocalsound } It 's like are we downsampling to sixteen ? Professor B : It 's a digital audio orientation for the board PhD C : Right . PhD A : Mmm . Professor B : it 's in the monitor so it 's PhD C : Thank God it 's not { vocalsound } more than that . Grad E : So { disfmarker } Professor B : Yeah . Grad E : And I have no idea what filter it 's using , Grad F : Is eight kilohertz { disfmarker } is { disfmarker } is eighty kilohertz generally accepted as like standard for voice ? Grad E : so Professor B : For telephone stuff . Grad E : Telephone . PhD D : Telephone . Grad F : Yeah that 's what I was gon na say , I mean like { disfmarker } Professor B : So it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } it 's just that they were operating from Switchboard which was a completely telephone database Grad F : so Oh , I see , so . Professor B : and so that was a standard for that sixteen s Grad F : OK . Grad E : So sixteen seems to be pretty typical for with this sort of thing . Professor B : Sixteen is more common for { disfmarker } for uh broadband stuff that is n't { disfmarker } Grad F : Right . Grad E : That is n't music . Professor B : that is n't music and is n't telephone , PhD C : And I guess if you 're comparing like { disfmarker } uh if you wan na run recognition on the PZM stuff you would want you do n't want to downsample the wh that Professor B : yeah . Grad E : Why is that ? Professor B : I do n't know . PhD C : right ? Well I don I mean if it 's any better Professor B : No actually I would think that you would { disfmarker } you would get better { disfmarker } you 'd get better high frequencies in the local mike . Grad E : All the way around I 'd think . Professor B : Uh but who knows ? I mean we do { vocalsound } we { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } we { disfmarker } we wan na find all this stuff out , PhD C : Yeah well we could try it . Grad E : Yeah . Professor B : we do n't know . Grad E : We 're gon na have plenty of low frequency on the P Z Ms with the fans . PhD C : OK . Yeah . Professor B : Uh yeah . Yeah . PhD C : Oh yeah there was just one more thing I wanted to say which is totally unrelated to the recognition except that um well { disfmarker } well it 's sort of related but um good news also uh I got { disfmarker } well Chuck Fillmore agreed to record meetings but he had too many people in his meetings and that 's too bad cuz they 're very animated and but uh Jerry also agreed so uh we 're starting on { disfmarker } on PhD A : They 're less animated . PhD C : Well but he has fewer { disfmarker } he { disfmarker } he wo n't have more than eight and it 's a meeting on even deeper understanding , EDU , so that sounds interesting . As a compliment to our front - end meeting Grad E : Dot EDU ? PhD C : and um so that 's gon na start Monday and one of the things that I was realizing is um it would be really great if anyone has any ideas on some kind of time synchronous way that people in the meeting can make a comment to the person whose gon na transcribe it or { disfmarker } or put a { vocalsound } push a button or something when they wan na make a note about `` oh boy you should probably erase those last few `` or uh `` wait I want this not to be recorded now `` or uh something like that s Professor B : Were n't we gon na do something with a pad at one point ? Postdoc G : The cross pads ? Grad E : Yeah , we could do it with the cross pads . PhD C : Cuz I was thinking you know if { disfmarker } if the person who sets up the meeting is n't there and it 's a group that we do n't know um and this came up talking to { disfmarker } to Jerry also that you know is there any way for them to indicate { disfmarker } to make sure that the qu request that they have that they make explicitly get addressed somehow Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : so I do n't know if anyone has ideas or { disfmarker } you could even write down `` oh it 's about three twenty five and `` { disfmarker } Professor B : Well what I was just suggesting is { disfmarker } is we have these { disfmarker } this cross pad just for this purpose Grad E : Yeah , and use that . Professor B : and just use that Grad E : Not a bad idea . Professor B : and if we sink it in { disfmarker } PhD C : That would be great . Professor B : The other thing is eh PhD C : That be great . Professor B : I do n't know if you know this or if it 's a question for the mail to Dan but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup or could we go to a third board ? Grad E : I do n't know . I do n't know . I 'll send mail to Dan and ask . I { disfmarker } I think that it 's the maximum we can do without a lot of effort because it 's one board with two digital channels . Professor B : Oh it is one board . Grad E : E eight each . So it { disfmarker } it takes two fibers in to the one board . And so w I think if we wan na do that { disfmarker } more than that we 'd have to have two boards , and then you have the synchronization issue . Professor B : But that 's a question because that would { disfmarker } if it was possible cuz it is i you know already we have a { disfmarker } a { disfmarker } a group of people in this room that can not all be miked Grad E : Right . Professor B : and it 's not just cuz we have n't been to the store , right it 's { disfmarker } PhD D : What is the limit on each of those f fiber channels , is it the Grad E : Eight . PhD D : It just { disfmarker } it 's eight channels come in , does it have do with the sampling rate ? Grad E : It 's eight . I have no idea . But each { disfmarker } each fiber channel has eight { disfmarker } eight channels and there are two ch two fibers that go in to the card . Professor B : It might be a hard limitation , Grad E : So Professor B : I mean one thing is it { disfmarker } the whole thing as I said is { disfmarker } is all structured in terms of forty - eight kilohertz sampling so that pushes requirements up a bit Grad E : Yeah . Professor B : but PhD D : I was just wondering if { disfmarker } if that could change . Grad E : I mean then we 'd also have to get another ADD and another mixer and all that sort of stuff . PhD D : If we could drop that . Professor B : Yeah . Grad E : So I { disfmarker } I 'll send a mail to Dan and ask him . Professor B : Yeah . Grad E : OK on the uh are we done with that ? So the oth topic is uh getting more mikes and different mikes , so I got a quote um We can fit { disfmarker } we have room for one more wireless and the wireless , this unit here is three fifty { disfmarker } three hundred fifty dollars , it { disfmarker } I did n't realize but we also have to get a tuner { disfmarker } the receiver { disfmarker } the other end , that 's uh four thirty um and then also PhD C : For { disfmarker } for each ? PhD D : Wow . PhD C : I mean the tuner is four thirty for each . Grad E : Yep . PhD C : Wow . Grad E : And we just need one more so { disfmarker } so Professor B : Yeah at least w we got the good ones . Grad E : Yeah . So that 's you know something like seven hundred eighty bucks for one more of these . Professor B : Yeah . OK . Grad E : Um and then also um It turns out that the connector that this thing uses is proprietary of Sony PhD D : Oh . Grad E : believe it or not and Sony only sells this headset . Postdoc G : Mmm . Grad E : So if we wan na use a different set { disfmarker } headset the solution that the guy suggested and they { disfmarker } apparently lots of people have done is Sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself . And that 's the other solution and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece and the { disfmarker } he recommended um a crown CM three eleven AE headset for two hundred bucks apiece . Professor B : There is n't this some sort of thing that plugs in , you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself ? Grad E : Becau - the reason is the only { disfmarker } only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or just the connector . Professor B : No I understand . The reason I ask is these sort of handmade uh wiring jobs fall apart in use so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them to do a custom job and put it together for this . Grad E : Oh I 'm sure they would , they would just charge us , PhD D : Well , and they 'd probably want quantity too , Grad E : so . Professor B : Well PhD D : they 'd Professor B : no they 'll just charge us more , so it 's { disfmarker } this PhD D : Mmm . Grad E : So { disfmarker } so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes ? Professor B : Not before having one come here and have some people try it out . Grad E : OK . Professor B : Because there 's no point in doing that if it 's not gon na be any better . Grad E : So why do n't we get one of these with the crown with a different headset ? Professor B : Yeah . Grad E : And { disfmarker } and see if that works . Professor B : And see if it 's preferable and if it is then we 'll get more . PhD C : Comfort . Grad E : Yeah . Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : Cuz I mean I think the microphones are OK it 's just the { disfmarker } the Grad E : Right , it 's just they 're not comfortable to wear . Professor B : Right . PhD C : Could make our own handbands and Grad E : Um , and he said they do n't have any of these in stock but they have them in LA and so it will take about a week to get here . Professor B : Yeah well it 's { disfmarker } Grad E : Um so OK to just go order ? Professor B : We 're in this for the long term , yeah . Just order it . Grad E : OK PhD C : It 's a lot of money for a handband . Grad E : and who is the contact if I wan na do an invoice Grad F : Yeah . Grad E : cuz I think that 's how we did it before . Professor B : Uh we 'll do this off - line , yeah . Grad F : It 's a long time to get from LA . Grad E : OK . And then nine channels is the maximum we can do , so . Professor B : Uh y right cuz { disfmarker } so one is for the daisy chain so that 's fifteen instead of sixteen Grad E : Without getting more stuff . Professor B : and there 's six on the table so that 's nine . Grad E : Right . PhD C : Can I ask a really dumb question ? Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : Is { disfmarker } { vocalsound } is there any way we can have you know like a { disfmarker } a wireless microphone that you pass around to the people who you know the extra people for the times they wan na talk that { disfmarker } Grad E : Probably . Professor B : That 's a good idea . PhD C : I mean { disfmarker } Professor B : That 's not a dumb question , it 's a good idea , PhD C : Well I mean { disfmarker } PhD A : Like uh like you know Jerry Springer thing , Professor B : yeah . Grad E : I 'm just not sure how we would handle that in the Grad F : That 's like the Conch . PhD C : Well but { disfmarker } PhD D : Like at conferences PhD A : you know r PhD C : well but there might be a way to say that there are gon na be these different people Grad F : See , look . PhD C : um and I do n't know identifying somehow ? PhD D : so nail the chairs down . PhD A : Yeah . Grad E : Yeah , somehow . PhD C : You know I was just thinking of Jerry Springer . Grad E : It 's not a bad idea . Professor B : No that { disfmarker } no { disfmarker } no PhD A :  Professor B : that 's a very { disfmarker } if we ca n't get another board and even if we can I have a feeling they 'll be some work . PhD D : The Springer mike . PhD C : I mean for the few times that you might wan na have that . Professor B : Let 's figure that we have eight which are set up and then there 's a ninth which is passed around to { disfmarker } Grad E : A hand - held , yeah . Professor B : that 's a good idea PhD D : Infinite expansion . Professor B : Right . Kind of rules out overlap but { disfmarker } { vocalsound } but uh PhD C : Well or also for you know if people are not Professor B : Yeah . Grad E : Well we could just hand around the lapel . Professor B : Uh no { disfmarker } no that 's { disfmarker } Grad E : Rather than get a { disfmarker } PhD C : No not the lapel . Grad E : do you want a handset ? Professor B : No . Grad E : Well I mean is the { disfmarker } is the hand - held really any better ? PhD D : Liz hates the lapel . Professor B : Yes . PhD C : I do n't know Grad E : OK . PhD C : but I d I know the lapel is really suboptimal . Professor B : No it { disfmarker } no it depends on the hand - held Grad E : Is awful ? Professor B : but hand { disfmarker } many hand - helds are built wi with sort of uh anti - shock sort of things so that it { disfmarker } it is less uh susceptible to hand noises . If you hold the lapel mike i you just get all k sorts of junk . PhD D : Mm - hmm . PhD C : Right . I mean the ones they really pass around must be sort of OK . Grad E : OK . Professor B : so Grad E : So I wonder if they have one that will hook up . Professor B : Yeah . They have { disfmarker } What ? Grad E : I wonder if they have one that will hook up to this or whether again we 'll have to wire it ourselves . PhD D : Well , you would n't want it to hook there you 'd just want it to hook into the receiver in the other room , right ? Professor B : No that 's uh { disfmarker } you need a transmitter . Grad E : What ? PhD D : Is th is n't that built into the mike ? Professor B : Oh I see . Get a { disfmarker } get a different radio , yeah . PhD C : Yeah just these ones that they pass around with no you know wireless Professor B : Yeah . But you need a ra but it has to correspond to the receiver . PhD D : Have a little antenna coming out the bottom . Grad E : It 's gon na be much easier to get one of these and just plug in a mike , is n't it ? PhD D : But then the mike has to h PhD A : Do you have to hand it around and if you have two pieces of Professor B : No no { disfmarker } PhD C : Right . Grad F : Yeah . PhD A :  Professor B : so right , so this is a good point , so yeah you have these { disfmarker } these mikes with a little antenna on the end right ? Grad E : OK . And do you think you would be able to use the same receiver ? Professor B : I do n't know . You 'll have to check with them , Grad E : OK I 'll { disfmarker } I 'll ask . Professor B : yeah . But that 's { disfmarker } that 's a great idea PhD D : It 's just a frequency . Grad E : Yeah . Professor B : and then just sort of have that as the { disfmarker } and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever and { disfmarker } and uh PhD C : Yeah because there 's only I mean as Andreas pointed out actually I think in the large { disfmarker } the larger the group the less interaction { disfmarker } the less people are talking um over each other { disfmarker } PhD A : Pretty soon . PhD D : Mmm , yeah . PhD C : it just { disfmarker } there might be a lot of people that speak once or twice and Professor B : Right . PhD A : Um Got ta go . Professor B : Off you go , yeah . Grad E : OK so I guess people who have to leave can leave and do we have anything else to discuss or should we just do digits ? Postdoc G : I { disfmarker } I thought of some extra { disfmarker } a couple of extra things I 'd like to mention . Grad E : OK . Postdoc G : One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far . So um as of last night um I 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine Grad E : uh Yep , Postdoc G : and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month , I think that by tomorrow we 'll have ten . PhD C : Uh it 's great { disfmarker } Professor B : Pretty close , Postdoc G : So they 're still working . Professor B : that 's good . PhD C : I j and this { disfmarker } I got this email from Jane at like two in the morning or something PhD D : Wow . Grad E : that 's good . PhD C : so it 's really great Postdoc G : It 's working out , thanks . PhD C : It 's really great . Postdoc G : Thanks . And then um also an idea for another meeting , which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data It 's sort of a { disfmarker } a little bit { disfmarker } a little bit PhD C : That 's a great idea . Professor B : Super idea . Grad E : Yep , that 'd be very interesting . PhD C : That 's a great idea cuz I 'd like to g have it recorded so that we can remember all the little things , Grad F : Yeah . Grad E : I 'd love to hear what they have to say . Postdoc G : Yeah . PhD C : that 's a great idea . PhD D : So if we got them to talk about this meeting , it would be a meta { disfmarker } meta meeting . Postdoc G : Yeah . Yeah , exa { vocalsound } exactly I guess { disfmarker } nested several layers , Professor B : Now you have eight transcribers and there 's ten of us Postdoc G : but Professor B : so how do we do this , is the only thing . PhD C : Or just have them talk amongst themselves . PhD D : Have them have their own meeting . PhD C : And have Postdoc G : Well that 's what I 'm thinking , Professor B : Oh . Postdoc G : yeah . Have them talk about the data and they { disfmarker } and they 've made observations to me PhD C : that would be great . Postdoc G : like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap , in fact it does but there are other groups of similar size that have very little , you know it 's part of it 's { disfmarker } it 's the norm of the group and all that and they have various observations that would be fun , I think . PhD C : That 's a great idea . Grad E : Yeah , I 'd like to hear what they s say . Postdoc G : Yeah . PhD C : Be great . Professor B : So maybe we could { disfmarker } they could have a meeting more or less without us that { disfmarker } to do this and we should record it Postdoc G : OK . Professor B : and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and { disfmarker } and could you know could tell us about it . Postdoc G : Yeah . Grad E : Give us a status . PhD C : Yeah . Postdoc G : Oh good . OK . Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : It 's { disfmarker } they will get to transcribe their own meeting but they also get paid for having a break Grad E : That would be weird . Postdoc G : What { disfmarker } what yeah that 's right . PhD C : and I think that 's a good idea , Postdoc G : Yeah exactly , yeah . Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : get them involved . Postdoc G : Great . PhD C : Um that 's a great idea . Postdoc G : Great . Professor B : Super . PhD C : I 'm really sorry I have to g no I have to go as well . Professor B : OK . Postdoc G : And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John { disfmarker } John Fiscus visit tomorrow . And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization { disfmarker } allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes but to be basically in three parts , the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects um other things and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing and { disfmarker } and uh then uh number two would be sort of a the { disfmarker } the transcription process so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the { disfmarker } the multitrans interface which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing and then um the third part would { disfmarker } and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say and I want it , you know k yeah see what they 're doing and also present what { disfmarker } what we 've chosen as ours and { disfmarker } and discuss that kind of thing . And so but he 's only here until until one and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon . S Professor B : OK . Postdoc G : And everybody who wants to attend is welcome . So Grad E : Oh , where you 're gon na meet ? Postdoc G : yeah . Here mostly but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration . Professor B : OK but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here . Yeah , OK . Postdoc G : Yeah . Mm - hmm . Grad E : I assume we 're not gon na try to record it ? Postdoc G : Oh I think that would be hard , yeah . Professor B : Yeah , I think just adds { disfmarker } Grad E : Alright . Postdoc G : Yeah . Professor B : Um good . Postdoc G : Thank you though , uh - huh . Professor B : So maybe do digits and recess ? Grad E : Unless there 's anything else ? Postdoc G : Yeah . Yeah . PhD D : Do digital ones ? Professor B : Uh OK . Postdoc G : Yeah . Grad E : Uh should y we make him wear Andreas ' mike or would that just be too confusing ? Professor B : Yeah . No I do n't think it 's confusing . Well , it does n't confuse me . Postdoc G : When we do this in the key { disfmarker } in the key { disfmarker } in the key it has to indicate that channel change , PhD D : Does it mess up the forms ? Postdoc G : right ? Grad E : Uh yeah I just do n't know how we would do that , so . I mean other than free { disfmarker } free form . Postdoc G : Well i have a time mark . PhD D : The on switch is here on the { disfmarker } on the top there . Postdoc G : Yeah . Professor B : OK . Grad E : And just clip it to your collar . Professor B : That 's fine . Grad J : OK , my name is uh Espen Eriksen . I 'm a Norwegian . Um uh this is my second semester at Berkeley . Currently I 'm taking uh my first graduate level courses in DSP and um when I come back to Norway I 'm gon na continue with the { disfmarker } more of a research project work { disfmarker } kind of work . So this semester I 'm starting up with a { disfmarker } with a small project through uh Dave Gelbart which I 'm taking a course with I got in touch with him and he told me about this project . So with the help of uh Dan Ellis I 'm gon na do small project associated to this . What I 'm gon na try to do is uh use { disfmarker } use ech echo cancellation to uh to handle the periods where you have overlapping talk . To try to do something about that . So currently I 'm um I 'm just reading up on echo cancellation , s looking into the theory behind that and then uh hopefully I get some results . So it { disfmarker } it 's a { disfmarker } it 's a project goes over the course of one semester . Grad E : Great . Grad J : So I 'm just here today to introduce myself . Tell about I 'll be { disfmarker } I 'll be working on this . Grad E : And are you staying at Berkeley or is { disfmarker } are you just here a semester ? Grad J : This is my second semester and last . Grad E : Ah second and last , Professor B : Yeah . Grad E : OK . Grad J : So I leave Professor B : He 's in the { disfmarker } he 's in the cour two two five D course . Grad J : Yeah , I 'm in Morgan 's course , Professor B : So , yeah . Grad J : yeah . Grad E : Good . PhD D : Welcome . Postdoc G : Then you { disfmarker } then you go back to Norway , that 's OK . Grad J : Yeah . Grad F : We were just talking about something like this yesterday or yeah yesterday with Liz . About doing some of the { vocalsound } echo cancellation stuff or possibly the spectroanalysis over the overlaps , so . Cool . Grad J : Yeah . Professor B : OK , Grad E : Digits ? Professor B : let 's do digits . OK . Grad E : And stop . 
Query : Summarize what was said about the microphone data PhD C : Um Well , I { disfmarker } I sent out an email s couple hours ago so um with Andreas ' help um Andreas put together a sort of no frills recognizer which is uh gender - dependent but like no adaptation , no cross - word models , no trigrams { disfmarker } a bigram recognizer and that 's trained on Switchboard which is telephone conversations . Um and thanks to Don 's help wh who { disfmarker } Don took the first meeting that Jane had transcribed and um { vocalsound } you know separated { disfmarker } used the individual channels we segmented it in into the segments that Jane had used and uh Don sampled that so { disfmarker } so eight K um and then we ran up to I guess the first twenty minutes , up to synch time of one two zero zero so is that { disfmarker } that 's twenty minutes or so ? Um yeah because I guess there 's some , Grad E : Or so . PhD C : and Don can talk to Jane about this , there 's some bug in the actual synch time file that ah uh I 'm { disfmarker } we 're not sure where it came from but stuff after that was a little messier . Anyway so it 's twenty minutes and I actually Grad E : Hmm . PhD C : um Grad E : I { disfmarker } was that { disfmarker } did that { disfmarker } did that recording have the glitch in the middle ? Postdoc G : I 'm puzzled by that . I { disfmarker } oh { disfmarker } oh , I see . PhD C : There 's { disfmarker } there 's a { disfmarker } Postdoc G : Oh there was a glitch somewhere . PhD C : yeah , so that actually um Grad F : Was it twenty minutes in , PhD C : if it was twenty minutes in then I do n't know Postdoc G : I forgot about that . Grad F : I thought { disfmarker } PhD A : Well it was interesting , Postdoc G : Well , I mean , they { disfmarker } PhD A : suddenly { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent Grad E : I do n't remember when it is . Postdoc G : but I was able to can transcribe PhD A : but i looking at { disfmarker } the first sentences looked much better than that and then suddenly it turned very bad and then we noticed that the reference was always one off with the { disfmarker } it was actually recognized PhD C : Wel Grad E : Oh no . Grad F : Yeah , that might be { disfmarker } that might be { disfmarker } that might be my fault . Postdoc G : Wow . PhD A : so Grad E : Oh so that was just a parsing mismatch . Grad F : I 'm not { disfmarker } PhD A : OK . PhD C : No actually it was { disfmarker } yeah i it was a complicated bug because they were sometimes one off and then sometimes totally random so um Grad F : yeah , I was pretty certain that it worked up until that time , Postdoc G : Oh . That 's not good . PhD C : Yeah PhD A : OK . PhD C : so that 's what we have Grad E : Alright . Grad F : so PhD C : but that { disfmarker } that will be completely gone if this synch time problem Postdoc G : Yeah . Grad E : The { disfmarker } the glitch PhD A : So { disfmarker } so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to Postdoc G : And the only glitch { disfmarker } Grad E : yeah . Postdoc G : yeah . PhD C : So you guys know . Professor B : S sorry I have n't seen the email , PhD C : Yeah . Grad E : Th - the Postdoc G : The { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } well { disfmarker } wait Professor B : what was the score ? PhD C : So here 's the actual copy of the email Postdoc G : we should say something about the glitch . He { disfmarker } he can say something about the glitch . PhD C : um oh OK Grad E : yeah . Postdoc G : Cuz it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } it 's { disfmarker } h it 's { disfmarker } it 's very small { disfmarker } PhD C : so does this glitch occur at other { disfmarker } Grad E : There { disfmarker } there { disfmarker } there 's an acoustic glitch that occurs where um the channels get slightly asynchronized Postdoc G : very small . Yep . PhD C : Oh . PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : Right . Grad E : so the { disfmarker } that { disfmarker } that problem has gone away in the original driver believe it or not when the SSH key gen ran the driver paused for a fraction of a second Professor B : Hmm . Grad F : Hmm . Grad E : and so the channels get a little asynchronous and so if you listen to it in the middle there 's a little part where it starts doing { disfmarker } doing click sounds . Professor B : So { disfmarker } PhD C : And is it only once that that happens ? Grad E : But yeah PhD C : OK . Grad E : it { disfmarker } right once in the middle . PhD C : There 's { disfmarker } the previous page has some more information about sort of what was wrong Professor B : so { disfmarker } so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice , PhD C : but Grad E : Um But that should n't affect anything PhD C : OK so that 's actually Postdoc G : S and it { disfmarker } Professor B : you see this here ? PhD C : It { disfmarker } y it 's { disfmarker } Grad E : yeah yeah `` bah `` PhD C : OK no { disfmarker } PhD A : Oh , and { disfmarker } PhD C : What happens is it actually affects the script that Don { disfmarker } PhD D : Huh . PhD C : I mean if we know about it then I guess it could always be checked for it Grad E : Well the acoustic one should n't do anything . PhD C : but they Grad F : Yeah , I do n't know exactly what affected it Postdoc G : I agree . I agree . PhD A : I { disfmarker } I have { disfmarker } Grad F : but I 'll { disfmarker } I 'll talk to you about it , PhD A : Yeah . Grad E : But I { disfmarker } I do remember { disfmarker } PhD C : Yeah . Grad F : I 'll show you the point . Postdoc G : Yeah . It { disfmarker } it had no effect on my transcription , PhD A : Mmm . Postdoc G : you know , I mean I { disfmarker } I had no trouble hearing it and { disfmarker } and having time bins Grad E : I do remember seeing once the transcriber produce an incorrect XML file where one of the synch numbers was incorrect . Postdoc G : but there was a { disfmarker } Oh . PhD C : Well , the { disfmarker } the synch time { disfmarker } the synch numbers have more significant digits than they should , Grad F : That 's what happened . Postdoc G : Oh . PhD H : Yeah . Grad E : Where { disfmarker } where they were n't monotonic . Grad F : There was { disfmarker } yeah , I mean { disfmarker } PhD C : right ? There 's things that are l in smaller increments than a frame . PhD H : Yeah . Postdoc G : Oh , interesting . PhD C : And so then , I mean you look at that and it 's got you know more than three significant digits in a synch time then that ca n't be right Grad E : Oh OK so that 's Grad F : Hmm . Postdoc G : Oh . PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : so anyway it 's { disfmarker } it 's just { disfmarker } Grad E : yeah sounds like a bug . Postdoc G : Yeah . PhD C : that 's why we only have twenty minutes but there 's a significant amount of { disfmarker } Grad F : Non - zero ? Um there are like more { disfmarker } cuz there 's a lot of zeros I tacked on just because of the way the script ran , Grad E : The other one I saw was that it yeah . Grad F : I mean but there were there was a point . PhD C : Yeah that was fine . That { disfmarker } that was OK . Grad E : The other one I saw was non non - monotonic synch times Grad F : OK . Grad E : and that definitely indicra indicates a bug . Grad F : Uh . PhD C : Well that would really be a problem , yeah . So anyway these are just the ones that are the prebug for one meeting . Grad F : Yeah . PhD C : um and what 's { disfmarker } which { disfmarker } Grad E : So that 's very encouraging . PhD C : this is really encouraging cuz this is free recognition , Professor B : Hmm . PhD H : Yeah . Professor B : Cool . PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : there 's no I mean the language model for Switchboard is totally different so you can see some like this Trent Lott which PhD D : Trent Lott . PhD C : um I mean these are sort of funny ones , PhD D : It 'll get those though . PhD C : there 's a lot of perfect ones and good ones and all the references , I mean you can read them and when we get more results you can look through and see Grad E : I and as I said I would like to look at the lattices PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : but um it 's pretty good . Grad E : because it sounded like even the ones it got wrong it sort of got it right ? PhD C : Well so I guess we can generate Grad E : Sounds likes ? PhD A : There are a fair number of errors that are , you know where { disfmarker } got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong . Postdoc G : Mm - hmm . PhD C : um Grad E : Yeah , and who cares ? And { disfmarker } and there were lots of { disfmarker } of course the `` uh uh `` - s , `` in on `` - s `` of uh `` - s . PhD A : Mmm , so if { disfmarker } PhD C : there 's { disfmarker } No those are actually PhD A : Yeah . PhD C : a lot of the errors I think are out of vocabulary , PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : so is it like PZM is three words , it 's PZM , PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : I mean there 's nothing There 's no language model for PZM or Grad E : Right . Ri - ri right . PhD C : um Grad E : Did you say there 's no language for PZM ? PhD C : No language model , I mean those { disfmarker } Grad E : Do you mean { disfmarker } so every time someone says PZM it 's an error ? Maybe we should n't say PZM in these meetings . PhD C : Well { disfmarker } well there 's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet and I mean um anyway there { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah , that 's right , Jimlet . Professor B : Well , we do n't even know what that means , PhD C : so { vocalsound } but this is really encouraging because Professor B : so I Grad E : Yeah , that 's right . PhD C : so , I mean the bottom line is even though it 's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of { disfmarker } of r reasonable s you know Switchboard this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained { disfmarker } mostly trained recognizer Grad E : Right . PhD C : and Switchboard - two is { disfmarker } got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic Grad E : Excellent . PhD C : and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one so there was @ @ so that 's great . Professor B : Yeah . Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did { disfmarker } had the ninety - three workshop PhD C : Um Professor B : and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : Oh yeah Professor B : you know PhD C : I mean this is really , PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : and thanks to Andreas who , I mean this is a PhD A : Mmm . Grad E : Well especially for the very first run , I mean you { disfmarker } 
Query : What was decided on the microphone procedures ? PhD C : so is it like PZM is three words , it 's PZM , PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : I mean there 's nothing There 's no language model for PZM or Grad E : Right . Ri - ri right . PhD C : um Grad E : Did you say there 's no language for PZM ? PhD C : No language model , I mean those { disfmarker } Grad E : Do you mean { disfmarker } so every time someone says PZM it 's an error ? Maybe we should n't say PZM in these meetings . PhD C : Well { disfmarker } well there 's all kinds of other stuff like Jimlet and I mean um anyway there { disfmarker } Grad E : Yeah , that 's right , Jimlet . Professor B : Well , we do n't even know what that means , PhD C : so { vocalsound } but this is really encouraging because Professor B : so I Grad E : Yeah , that 's right . PhD C : so , I mean the bottom line is even though it 's not a huge amount of data um it should be uh reasonable to actually run recognition and be like within the scope of { disfmarker } of r reasonable s you know Switchboard this is like h about how well we do on Switchboard - two data with the Switchboard - one trained { disfmarker } mostly trained recognizer Grad E : Right . PhD C : and Switchboard - two is { disfmarker } got sort of a different population of speakers and a different topic Grad E : Excellent . PhD C : and they 're talking about things in the news that happened after Switchboard - one so there was @ @ so that 's great . Professor B : Yeah . Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did { disfmarker } had the ninety - three workshop PhD C : Um Professor B : and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard . PhD A : Mm - hmm . PhD C : Oh yeah Professor B : you know PhD C : I mean this is really , PhD A : Mmm . PhD C : and thanks to Andreas who , I mean this is a PhD A : Mmm . Grad E : Well especially for the very first run , I mean you { disfmarker } PhD A : Oh it 's the { disfmarker } Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : eh um Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : yeah Grad E : the first run I ran of Switchboard I got a hundred twenty percent word error but PhD C : So and what al also this means is that Postdoc G : Right . PhD C : um Grad E : Not Switchboard , PhD A : Well it 's { disfmarker } PhD C : I mean there 's a bunch of things in this note to various people Grad E : uh Broadcast News . PhD C : especially I guess um with Jane that { disfmarker } that would help for { disfmarker } since we have this new data now uh in order to go from the transcripts more easily to um just the words that the recognizer would use for scoring . I had to deal with some of it by hand but I think a lot of it can be automated s by { disfmarker } Professor B : Oh one thing I guess I did n't get so you know the language model was straight from { disfmarker } from bigram from Switchboard the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or { disfmarker } or PhD A : Yeah . PhD C : Yeah . Professor B : So they did n't have anything from this acoustic data in yet ? Postdoc G : That 's amazing . Grad E : Yeah , so that 's great . PhD C : No . Professor B : OK . PhD C : And actually { disfmarker } we actually um used Switchboard telephone bandwidth models Postdoc G : That 's amazing . PhD A : Well that 's { disfmarker } those are the only we ones there are , Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : which I guess PhD D : I was just gon na say , PhD C : so that 's the on that 's the only acoustic training data that we have a lot of PhD D : yeah . PhD A : I mean Grad E : Yeah . PhD A : Right . PhD C : and I guess Ramana , so a guy at SRI said that um there 's not a huge amount of difference going from { disfmarker } Professor B : Right . PhD C : it 's { disfmarker } it 's not like we probably lose a huge amount but we wo n't know because we do n't have any full band models for s conversational speech . PhD D : It 's probably not as bad as going f using full band models on telephone band speech PhD C : So . PhD A : Oh yeah . PhD C : Right . PhD D : right ? PhD A : Yeah . Professor B : Yeah , PhD C : Right , so it 's { disfmarker } so Professor B : but for Broadcast News when we { disfmarker } we played around between the two there was n't a huge loss . Grad E : Right , it was not a big deal . PhD C : Yeah PhD A : I should { disfmarker } I should say that { disfmarker } the language model is not just Switchboard PhD C : so I wou so that 's good . Grad E : Although combining em worked well . PhD A : it 's also { disfmarker } I mean there 's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News but with a little less weight PhD C : Yeah . PhD A : uh because Professor B : Uh - huh . PhD C : Like Trent Lott must have been from PhD A : mm - hmm , right . PhD C : I guess { vocalsound } Switchboard was before PhD A : Um By the way just { disfmarker } for fun we also ran , PhD C : uh . Professor B : Good point . PhD A : I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection Professor B : Mm - hmm . PhD A : so just for the heck of it I ran that Grad E : And it said a hundred percent male ? 
Query : What were the changes decided on the equipment ? Grad E : So if we wan na use a different set { disfmarker } headset the solution that the guy suggested and they { disfmarker } apparently lots of people have done is Sony will sell you the jack with just wires coming out the end and then you can buy a headset that has pigtail and solder it yourself . And that 's the other solution and so the jacks are forty bucks apiece and the { disfmarker } he recommended um a crown CM three eleven AE headset for two hundred bucks apiece . Professor B : There is n't this some sort of thing that plugs in , you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself ? Grad E : Becau - the reason is the only { disfmarker } only thing you can get that will plug into this is this mike or just the connector . Professor B : No I understand . The reason I ask is these sort of handmade uh wiring jobs fall apart in use so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them to do a custom job and put it together for this . Grad E : Oh I 'm sure they would , they would just charge us , PhD D : Well , and they 'd probably want quantity too , Grad E : so . Professor B : Well PhD D : they 'd Professor B : no they 'll just charge us more , so it 's { disfmarker } this PhD D : Mmm . Grad E : So { disfmarker } so my question is should we go ahead and get na nine identical head - mounted crown mikes ? Professor B : Not before having one come here and have some people try it out . Grad E : OK . Professor B : Because there 's no point in doing that if it 's not gon na be any better . Grad E : So why do n't we get one of these with the crown with a different headset ? Professor B : Yeah . Grad E : And { disfmarker } and see if that works . Professor B : And see if it 's preferable and if it is then we 'll get more . PhD C : Comfort . Grad E : Yeah . Professor B : Yeah . PhD C : Cuz I mean I think the microphones are OK it 's just the { disfmarker } the 
Query : Summarize the whole meeting . Project Manager : Mm . Marketing : So , Project Manager : So , uh now { vocalsound } Marketing : Hi Christa . { vocalsound } Project Manager : it 's the { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Hi Sammy . { vocalsound } It 's the detail design meeting , so we 're going { disfmarker } last meeting . So um , first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype .

Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course . Marketing : Yes , of course . Of c course . { vocalsound } User Interface : { gap } , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and { disfmarker } That 's all I wanted to say . Marketing : Ah . User Interface : Now it 's technical specification by our colleague . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : So { disfmarker } Marketing : Oh , there is { vocalsound } a button missing . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Okay . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons . Marketing : It 's in option . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . So function , mm { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this { vocalsound } jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . { vocalsound } Then you ha you 'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you do n't want you can just use normal button . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : And we have speech recognition . Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise . Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And it can also do the action . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And location finder . And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . You can just say , where is my remote control . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby { gap } . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Bobby . { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . Marketing : { vocalsound } Hey , babe . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } And then , { vocalsound } it will say hi . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Bob . { vocalsound } Hey Bob . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah , hi , and then you can use it . { vocalsound } Marketing : Okay , Project Manager : Hmm . { vocalsound } 'Kay . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : that 's good . Industrial Designer : So , { vocalsound } um our team is now fruits . Mainly strawberry . So , you can { vocalsound } have { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Oh , these are strawberries . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Are colourful . Yeah . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Material , we want to stick to titanium . { vocalsound } We will send , we want to { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Fruit smelling spongy titanium . { vocalsound } I did n't know it exist , but that 's great . Industrial Designer : Yeah , or s { vocalsound } So , we want to have { vocalsound } simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours . Marketing : Ha . Project Manager : Ho-ho . That 's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ? Marketing : You mean we can change the colour uh of th Industrial Designer : For the L_C_D_ . Marketing : Yeah . Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : With titanium it 's { disfmarker } it is silver . Marketing : Tit titanium is { disfmarker } User Interface : We are still working on titanium . Project Manager : Mm-mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : So , r we 'll start with L_C_D_ . Marketing : Uh , okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Mm , yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : You can ask Bob . It 's Tuesday . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Hey , you know you 're theme today . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Yeah , Bob , please . { vocalsound } { gap } Tuesday colour . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Even you can configure your colours for its { disfmarker } the { disfmarker } depending on your mood , or s Marketing : Okay . Project Manager : Hmm . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Black for Sunday . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } And you can have many colours on weekends . Or { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ? { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Wh wh Industrial Designer : Huh ? Marketing : On the L_C_D_ ? Industrial Designer : Ah , these are like sensors . Marketing : Oh . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Of course . User Interface : That 's location sensors . Marketing : { vocalsound } What do you think ? { vocalsound } Strawberry sensors . { vocalsound } Very useful . Project Manager : Okay . { vocalsound } Strawberries . Industrial Designer : So , { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : after this meeting we 'll propose a party for our success for { disfmarker } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Ah . { vocalsound } Marketing : Lounge meeting . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know . Marketing : { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah , and we can just { gap } some strawberry first . Um { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Okay . { vocalsound } Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } Marketing : Alright . Good . { vocalsound } User Interface : Oops . Industrial Designer : S Marketing : So , huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : So , any specific questions for { disfmarker } Project Manager : we 'll see in the financial part if uh { vocalsound } all { vocalsound } { gap } { vocalsound } gets into { disfmarker } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } It makes sense . Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : Let 's make a party first maybe . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } W Who is the five uh { disfmarker } fifty millions we { vocalsound } first make a party in ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . Then we can discuss { disfmarker } We can { disfmarker } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left . { vocalsound } Marketing : So uh , this is { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Marketing : What a design . Project Manager : Okay . { vocalsound } Uh , so { disfmarker } Let 's uh , Marketing : { vocalsound } It 's my turn . Project Manager : yeah , let 's see if uh th it 's meet the evaluation criterium . { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm-hmm . Let 's see if this { disfmarker } Yeah , if you meet { vocalsound } the evaluation criterion . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Oops . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Fudge . Marketing : Yeah . So , evaluation please . So . You made a very nice prototype , and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our { disfmarker } what we want to do , and things like that . So mm { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Uh , next slide , please . { vocalsound } As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry { vocalsound } uh { vocalsound } remote control , it 's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . To { disfmarker } so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it does n't fulfil at all . And we 're all l going to list all the criterion . I 'm going to go to that next slide , Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ? Industrial Designer : Fancy . Marketing : So these are the criterion uh I 'm { disfmarker } I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let 's let 's see , so let 's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Huh . Marketing : So , Industrial Designer : Yeah , what 's is really { disfmarker } Marketing : what do you think , is it fancy ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh , it 's really { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } It is very very fancy . Or have you ever seen something like that ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah . Marketing : Yeah , of course . Project Manager : Uh what do you think ? Marketing : What do you think ? User Interface : Feel the weight . Marketing : Is it { disfmarker } The weight is later . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Oh . User Interface : Really . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh-huh . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Now { vocalsound } we 're { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay . Marketing : We 're on the fanciness now . I think it 's quite fancy . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : We can give at least five or six , seven . Marketing : It 's uh { disfmarker } Yeah , so { disfmarker } No it 's it 's one . Project Manager : It 's in the other { gap } . Industrial Designer : Oh , { gap } Oh . So { disfmarker } Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . Oh , okay . So { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , o one means it 's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . Project Manager : Mm . { vocalsound } Marketing : So it 's one or two . Project Manager : Two . Let 's say two , yeah . Industrial Designer : M maybe two . Marketing : What do you think ? Two ? User Interface : Two . Two . Marketing : Okay . So here , two . Up . Industrial Designer : Technology . Marketing : Then we have uh technology . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Um { disfmarker } Marketing : So , what about technology ? We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based { gap } , Industrial Designer : And we have L_C_D_ . Marketing : we have L_C_D_ . Project Manager : Change colour of t Industrial Designer : So you change colours . Marketing : Change colour , I mean that 's very { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Useful . Project Manager : Yeah , I think it 's a { disfmarker } Marketing : Quite User Interface : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Marketing : d I think it 's a one for that , at least . Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . It 's silly . Marketing : At least a one , yeah . Project Manager : Mm-mm . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : Robustness , uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Uh , still we need to cha { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } So { vocalsound } let 's suppose my daughter take it and um { vocalsound } { disfmarker } and through it away . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um { disfmarker } Marketing : Do you think it makes sense that it 's going to live again ? Uh , maybe not the prototype . Project Manager : The strawberries { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah , it { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : Oh . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Let 's try . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Oh my god . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Maybe strawberry . Marketing : Okay , we just lost one strawberry . User Interface : No . Industrial Designer : Oh . Marketing : So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : No . How can I say this . Marketing : Not at all ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , we can easily plug it . User Interface : It 's still it 's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . Marketing : It is { disfmarker } Yeah . { vocalsound } Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } A strawberry . Marketing : So it 's not so bad . Project Manager : Mm-mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Marketing : I um uh I would say three . Project Manager : Yeah . But it 's too { gap } . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : It 's um robust , yeah . Marketing : Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ? Industrial Designer : Useful ? Marketing : Useful . { vocalsound } Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , { gap } { disfmarker } Marketing : So I do n't know . These buttons are uh { disfmarker } It not clear . Project Manager : Oh , yeah , lets me try . Marketing : But you have at least uh next produce . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : What is uh next , please ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , channel . I this is volume control and channel changes . These are the main { disfmarker } Marketing : Uh , it depends on the { disfmarker } Project Manager : And you can uh do di two sites ? Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : You { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option . Project Manager : Okay , also . Industrial Designer : So if you do n't want { disfmarker } Marketing : So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you can not go to channel twenty five directly . Industrial Designer : Yeah , um { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : You can , by using the { disfmarker } User Interface : You can . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Directly . User Interface : You go { disfmarker } you { disfmarker } Project Manager : You c push here the the { disfmarker } User Interface : So , the basic mode { disfmarker } Project Manager : yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . So that 's simple . The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down . Marketing : Oh , it 's a jog dial , okay . User Interface : Or if you go to the site , it 's channel up channel down . Industrial Designer : And channel . Marketing : Uh-huh . Okay . User Interface : And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : You select twenty , you select five . Industrial Designer : You can select . Marketing : { vocalsound } Okay . User Interface : That 's it . Industrial Designer : Yeah mm . Marketing : It 's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? User Interface : No . Marketing : Do n't you think so ? May { disfmarker } not { disfmarker } okay , we can go . That 's uh { disfmarker } You 're right . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : That 's { disfmarker } it 's less uh { disfmarker } Yeah . But it 's it 's nice , because people anyway do n't go there . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Yeah mm . Marketing : But { disfmarker } { vocalsound } So what do you think for it , usefulness ? Industrial Designer : So , d Yeah , we need to address { disfmarker } we want { disfmarker } Marketing : Seems to be useful . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So Project Manager : { vocalsound } Let me understand well , Industrial Designer : so { disfmarker } Project Manager : because I 'm not sure { disfmarker } that 's for { disfmarker } that this one are b d uh two dir directional button . Marketing : Both . Yeah . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Up . Marketing : Up down or left right . Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . And which { disfmarker } what is that ? User Interface : It 's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . Industrial Designer : This is jog wheel . Marketing : That { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay , okay . It 's a kind { disfmarker } Oh , okay okay . { vocalsound } User Interface : Like , selecting the menus . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Um , { vocalsound } see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one . Marketing : Cool . Project Manager : Oh oh okay , great . Marketing : I would say then uh { disfmarker } { gap } Project Manager : Now it 's looks us useful . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : Two or three ? Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Two or three ? Industrial Designer : Two , maybe . { vocalsound } Marketing : Two . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : Okay , two . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } So size and weight . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . { gap } Marketing : Is it the the the effective size and weight that the { disfmarker } Is it uh real size , real weight ? Or { disfmarker } Because it { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , it 's { disfmarker } size al almost { gap } { disfmarker } Marketing : Size is going to be that , yeah ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , because it is { disfmarker } Marketing : Uh , and and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium . User Interface : Sure , Project Manager : Mm-mm . User Interface : without titanium alloy , it 's going to be light . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : It 's going to be lighter , Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Of course . Marketing : because this seems to be very heavy f I mean , Industrial Designer : Heavy . Yeah . Marketing : for my daughter , for instance . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Not sure if uh { vocalsound } she can use it . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : But sides { disfmarker } uh , the sides should be okay . { gap } . Yeah Marketing : So , should be okay . Industrial Designer : mm . Marketing : Up to three for that , Project Manager : Mm-mm . Marketing : because I 'm { disfmarker } have n't seen the weight so I must not uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay . Okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Oh . Marketing : Colour and shape . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Uh-oh . { vocalsound } Marketing : Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : But um , it 's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh { vocalsound } the case . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : The case is silver titanium , no ? Marketing : It 's a { disfmarker } it 's going to be titanium . Okay , okay . Project Manager : Yeah , it 's { gap } . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : That 's nice . Project Manager : Let 's imagine . Marketing : { vocalsound } I think it 's good . Okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } And what about the strawberries on the top ? { vocalsound } I 'm not convince . { vocalsound } But maybe I 'm not trendy . But , uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yahoo . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Well y you know , it 's this uh fruit and vegetable year . Industrial Designer : Oh . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , but uh { vocalsound } uh they 're not useful . Marketing : So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : I I mean it { disfmarker } that 's uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } So maybe , I think { disfmarker } Marketing : Uh , I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : Yeah , well { disfmarker } Marketing : Whether it 's fancy or not now , it { disfmarker } we have to decide . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Um { disfmarker } Marketing : But this Project Manager : I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful . Marketing : If it 's { disfmarker } Uh-huh . So , that they will { disfmarker } that maybe the fruit may be here instead . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah , well then it 's bit difficult to use .

Project Manager : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Black for Sunday . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } And you can have many colours on weekends . Or { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ? { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Wh wh Industrial Designer : Huh ? Marketing : On the L_C_D_ ? Industrial Designer : Ah , these are like sensors . Marketing : Oh . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } User Interface : { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Of course . User Interface : That 's location sensors . Marketing : { vocalsound } What do you think ? { vocalsound } Strawberry sensors . { vocalsound } Very useful . Project Manager : Okay . { vocalsound } Strawberries . Industrial Designer : So , { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } { vocalsound } 
Query : What were the advantages of the design for the prototype ? User Interface : Now it 's technical specification by our colleague . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : So { disfmarker } Marketing : Oh , there is { vocalsound } a button missing . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Okay . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons . Marketing : It 's in option . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . So function , mm { disfmarker } Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this { vocalsound } jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . { vocalsound } Then you ha you 'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you do n't want you can just use normal button . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : And we have speech recognition . Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise . Marketing : Hmm . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And it can also do the action . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : And location finder . And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . You can just say , where is my remote control . Marketing : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby { gap } . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Bobby . { vocalsound } Mm-hmm .

Or { disfmarker } { vocalsound } 
Query : Summarize the discussion about product evaluation . Marketing : { vocalsound } It 's my turn . Project Manager : yeah , let 's see if uh th it 's meet the evaluation criterium . { vocalsound } Marketing : Mm-hmm . Let 's see if this { disfmarker } Yeah , if you meet { vocalsound } the evaluation criterion . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Oops . Marketing : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Fudge . Marketing : Yeah . So , evaluation please . So . You made a very nice prototype , and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our { disfmarker } what we want to do , and things like that . So mm { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Uh , next slide , please . { vocalsound } As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry { vocalsound } uh { vocalsound } remote control , it 's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . To { disfmarker } so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it does n't fulfil at all . And we 're all l going to list all the criterion . I 'm going to go to that next slide , Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ? Industrial Designer : Fancy . Marketing : So these are the criterion uh I 'm { disfmarker } I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let 's let 's see , so let 's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Huh . Marketing : So , Industrial Designer : Yeah , what 's is really { disfmarker } Marketing : what do you think , is it fancy ? { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Uh , it 's really { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } It is very very fancy . Or have you ever seen something like that ? { vocalsound } Project Manager : { vocalsound } Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah . Marketing : Yeah , of course . Project Manager : Uh what do you think ? Marketing : What do you think ? User Interface : Feel the weight . Marketing : Is it { disfmarker } The weight is later . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Oh . User Interface : Really . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Uh-huh . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Now { vocalsound } we 're { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : Okay . Marketing : We 're on the fanciness now . I think it 's quite fancy . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : We can give at least five or six , seven . Marketing : It 's uh { disfmarker } Yeah , so { disfmarker } No it 's it 's one . Project Manager : It 's in the other { gap } . Industrial Designer : Oh , { gap } Oh . So { disfmarker } Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . Oh , okay . So { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , o one means it 's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . Project Manager : Mm . { vocalsound } Marketing : So it 's one or two . Project Manager : Two . Let 's say two , yeah . Industrial Designer : M maybe two . Marketing : What do you think ? Two ? User Interface : Two . Two . Marketing : Okay . So here , two . Up . Industrial Designer : Technology . Marketing : Then we have uh technology . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Um { disfmarker } Marketing : So , what about technology ? We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based { gap } , Industrial Designer : And we have L_C_D_ . Marketing : we have L_C_D_ . Project Manager : Change colour of t Industrial Designer : So you change colours . Marketing : Change colour , I mean that 's very { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Useful . Project Manager : Yeah , I think it 's a { disfmarker } Marketing : Quite User Interface : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Marketing : d I think it 's a one for that , at least . Project Manager : Yeah . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . It 's silly . Marketing : At least a one , yeah . Project Manager : Mm-mm . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : Robustness , uh-huh . Industrial Designer : Uh , still we need to cha { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } So { vocalsound } let 's suppose my daughter take it and um { vocalsound } { disfmarker } and through it away . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Um { disfmarker } Marketing : Do you think it makes sense that it 's going to live again ? Uh , maybe not the prototype . Project Manager : The strawberries { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah , it { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : Oh . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Let 's try . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Oh my god . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Maybe strawberry . Marketing : Okay , we just lost one strawberry . User Interface : No . Industrial Designer : Oh . Marketing : So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : No . How can I say this . Marketing : Not at all ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , we can easily plug it . User Interface : It 's still it 's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . Marketing : It is { disfmarker } Yeah . { vocalsound } Yeah . User Interface : { vocalsound } A strawberry . Marketing : So it 's not so bad . Project Manager : Mm-mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Marketing : I um uh I would say three . Project Manager : Yeah . But it 's too { gap } . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : It 's um robust , yeah . Marketing : Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ? Industrial Designer : Useful ? Marketing : Useful . { vocalsound } Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , { gap } { disfmarker } Marketing : So I do n't know . These buttons are uh { disfmarker } It not clear . Project Manager : Oh , yeah , lets me try . Marketing : But you have at least uh next produce . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : What is uh next , please ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , channel . I this is volume control and channel changes . These are the main { disfmarker } Marketing : Uh , it depends on the { disfmarker } Project Manager : And you can uh do di two sites ? Marketing : Okay . Industrial Designer : You { disfmarker } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option . Project Manager : Okay , also . Industrial Designer : So if you do n't want { disfmarker } Marketing : So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you can not go to channel twenty five directly . Industrial Designer : Yeah , um { disfmarker } yeah . Project Manager : You can , by using the { disfmarker } User Interface : You can . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Directly . User Interface : You go { disfmarker } you { disfmarker } Project Manager : You c push here the the { disfmarker } User Interface : So , the basic mode { disfmarker } Project Manager : yeah . { vocalsound } User Interface : Yeah . So that 's simple . The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down . Marketing : Oh , it 's a jog dial , okay . User Interface : Or if you go to the site , it 's channel up channel down . Industrial Designer : And channel . Marketing : Uh-huh . Okay . User Interface : And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this . Marketing : Yeah . User Interface : You select twenty , you select five . Industrial Designer : You can select . Marketing : { vocalsound } Okay . User Interface : That 's it . Industrial Designer : Yeah mm . Marketing : It 's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? User Interface : No . Marketing : Do n't you think so ? May { disfmarker } not { disfmarker } okay , we can go . That 's uh { disfmarker } You 're right . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : That 's { disfmarker } it 's less uh { disfmarker } Yeah . But it 's it 's nice , because people anyway do n't go there . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Yeah mm . Marketing : But { disfmarker } { vocalsound } So what do you think for it , usefulness ? Industrial Designer : So , d Yeah , we need to address { disfmarker } we want { disfmarker } Marketing : Seems to be useful . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So Project Manager : { vocalsound } Let me understand well , Industrial Designer : so { disfmarker } Project Manager : because I 'm not sure { disfmarker } that 's for { disfmarker } that this one are b d uh two dir directional button . Marketing : Both . Yeah . Yeah . User Interface : Yeah . Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Up . Marketing : Up down or left right . Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . And which { disfmarker } what is that ? User Interface : It 's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . Industrial Designer : This is jog wheel . Marketing : That { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay , okay . It 's a kind { disfmarker } Oh , okay okay . { vocalsound } User Interface : Like , selecting the menus . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Um , { vocalsound } see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one . Marketing : Cool . Project Manager : Oh oh okay , great . Marketing : I would say then uh { disfmarker } { gap } Project Manager : Now it 's looks us useful . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : Two or three ? Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Two or three ? Industrial Designer : Two , maybe . { vocalsound } Marketing : Two . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Marketing : Okay , two . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } So size and weight . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . { gap } Marketing : Is it the the the effective size and weight that the { disfmarker } Is it uh real size , real weight ? Or { disfmarker } Because it { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , it 's { disfmarker } size al almost { gap } { disfmarker } Marketing : Size is going to be that , yeah ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , because it is { disfmarker } Marketing : Uh , and and { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium . User Interface : Sure , Project Manager : Mm-mm . User Interface : without titanium alloy , it 's going to be light . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Marketing : It 's going to be lighter , Project Manager : { vocalsound } User Interface : Of course . Marketing : because this seems to be very heavy f I mean , Industrial Designer : Heavy . Yeah . Marketing : for my daughter , for instance . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : { vocalsound } Not sure if uh { vocalsound } she can use it . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : But sides { disfmarker } uh , the sides should be okay . { gap } . Yeah Marketing : So , should be okay . Industrial Designer : mm . Marketing : Up to three for that , Project Manager : Mm-mm . Marketing : because I 'm { disfmarker } have n't seen the weight so I must not uh { disfmarker } User Interface : Okay . Okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Oh . Marketing : Colour and shape . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Uh-oh . { vocalsound } Marketing : Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : But um , it 's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh { vocalsound } the case . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : The case is silver titanium , no ? Marketing : It 's a { disfmarker } it 's going to be titanium . Okay , okay . Project Manager : Yeah , it 's { gap } . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : That 's nice . Project Manager : Let 's imagine . Marketing : { vocalsound } I think it 's good . Okay . Project Manager : { vocalsound } And what about the strawberries on the top ? { vocalsound } I 'm not convince . { vocalsound } But maybe I 'm not trendy . But , uh { disfmarker } Marketing : Yahoo . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Well y you know , it 's this uh fruit and vegetable year . Industrial Designer : Oh . Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Project Manager : Yeah , but uh { vocalsound } uh they 're not useful . Marketing : So { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Project Manager : I I mean it { disfmarker } that 's uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { vocalsound } So maybe , I think { disfmarker } Marketing : Uh , I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Yep . Industrial Designer : Yeah , well { disfmarker } Marketing : Whether it 's fancy or not now , it { disfmarker } we have to decide . Project Manager : Hmm . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Um { disfmarker } Marketing : But this Project Manager : I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful . Marketing : If it 's { disfmarker } Uh-huh . So , that they will { disfmarker } that maybe the fruit may be here instead . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah , well then it 's bit difficult to use . Not like this d We 're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too . Project Manager : Mm-hmm . But the n { vocalsound } Yeah . Industrial Designer : So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . Project Manager : Mm . Industrial Designer : So it 's { disfmarker } Marketing : So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Even { disfmarker } Project Manager : No , I 'm not sure uh why { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : These buttons { disfmarker } Project Manager : uh if it was like this { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : { gap } But it looks really { vocalsound } not really good . Project Manager : I It 's { gap } n { vocalsound } no , it 's not fancy any more . Industrial Designer : I mean , the f Yeah . So these are kind of rubber things . Even if you lose one you can just put whatever . Project Manager : Okay . User Interface : And { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and { disfmarker } Project Manager : Uh-huh . And different routes . Okay , I see what { disfmarker } User Interface : Moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . Even if it is , you know , it 's very rounded , Industrial Designer : Yeah . User Interface : but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it 's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : Okay , so you you you feel like it 's something uh a protection for the remote control . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , we 've { disfmarker } yeah we have sensors here and so here and here , Project Manager : Also . Industrial Designer : so we just { disfmarker } Yeah , so even if you do n't put , it works . But this is really fancy . { gap } Project Manager : Okay . Marketing : I suggested three . Project Manager : Okay . { vocalsound } Marketing : Because uh , everybody s does n't seem to be convince , User Interface : Okay . Okay . Marketing : although it 's quite { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : You have good arguments . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : But { disfmarker } Project Manager : Okay . { vocalsound } { vocalsound } Marketing : And uh the last one is adaptive . This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ? User Interface : Sure , sure , just look at it . { vocalsound } It 's full adaptable . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Great . Project Manager : { vocalsound } Wow , that 's a { disfmarker } { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Fully adaptable . User Interface : Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know . Marketing : That 's { disfmarker } Yeah . { vocalsound } So you can fit into your palm , okay . Project Manager : Yea Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : That { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : You can { disfmarker } Marketing : What else can we need ? Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } Marketing : You { disfmarker } Do you think you are gon na be able to do that with ti titanium as well ? Project Manager : Yeah , it 's fudge titanium . { vocalsound } You know . Marketing : { vocalsound } It 's fudge , yeah , yeah . Project Manager : Right , yeah . { vocalsound } And uh { disfmarker } { vocalsound } User Interface : Mm , { gap } { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah , fruit titanium , yeah . Well , I if if this is { disfmarker } if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Yeah . { vocalsound } Project Manager : Okay . { vocalsound } Let 's go for one . { vocalsound } Marketing : { vocalsound } Okay . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Marketing : Now we have to do the average . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : Three , three , six , eight , eleven . Marketing : { vocalsound } Who is good in math ? { vocalsound } User Interface : It 's two point one seven . Marketing : Okay . { vocalsound } Two point one seven . That 's nice . Two point one seven out of seven . Industrial Designer : Hmm . Marketing : I think we have a good good thing . Project Manager : Yeah . Marketing : Well , that 's all I had to say about the evaluation . Project Manager : So it 's a good evaluation . Marketing : So { disfmarker } It seems to be good , yeah . Project Manager : Yeah . Mm . Industrial Designer : Yeah mm . Marketing : We have uh { disfmarker } Industrial Designer : Yeah , two one one seven , we have . So { disfmarker } Marketing : Yeah . Project Manager : Mm-mm . Marketing : Yeah . Okay . Thanks . 
Query : Why did the group decide to give two points on usefulness when doing product evaluation ? Marketing : Useful . { vocalsound } Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , { gap } { disfmarker } Marketing : So I do n't know . These buttons are uh { disfmarker } It not clear . Project Manager : Oh , yeah , lets me try . Marketing : But you have at least uh next produce . Project Manager : Yeah . Industrial Designer : Yeah . Project Manager : What is uh next , please ? Industrial Designer : Yeah , channel . I this is volume control and channel changes . These are the main { disfmarker } Marketing : Uh , it depends on the { disfmarker } Project Manager : And you can uh do di two sites ?

Marketing : Do n't you think so ? May { disfmarker } not { disfmarker } okay , we can go . That 's uh { disfmarker } You 're right . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and { disfmarker } Yeah . Marketing : That 's { disfmarker } it 's less uh { disfmarker } Yeah . But it 's it 's nice , because people anyway do n't go there . Industrial Designer : Yeah , yeah . Yeah mm . Marketing : But { disfmarker } { vocalsound } So what do you think for it , usefulness ? Industrial Designer : So , d Yeah , we need to address { disfmarker } we want { disfmarker } Marketing : Seems to be useful . { vocalsound } Industrial Designer : we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ .

Query : Summarize the whole meeting . The Chair (Hon. Anthony Rota (NipissingTimiskaming, Lib.)) : I call this meeting to order . Welcome to the 12th meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic . This will be the first hybrid meeting of the committee . Some members will be participating via videoconference and some will be participating in person . This follows the order made by the House on May26,2020 . Members who have already participated in a virtual meeting of the special committee may actually not notice any change , except for the fact that some members are also participating from the floor of the House . An additional rubric , that of statements by members , was also added to the proceedings of the committee . In order to ensure that those joining the meeting via video conference can be seen and heard by those in the chamber , two screens have been set up in the chamber on either side of the Speakers chair . Sound amplification for virtual interventions will be available , and members in the chamber can listen to the floor sound or interpretation using the earpieces on their desks . Before speaking , please wait until I recognize you by name . Please also direct your remarks through the Chair . Thank you . For those of you joining via video conference , I would like to remind you to leave your mike on mute when you are not speaking . Also , please note that if you want to speak in English , you should be on the English channel . If you want to speak French , you should be on the French channel . Should you wish to alternate between the two languages , you should change the channel to the language that you are speaking each time you switch languages . Should members participating by videoconference need to request the floor outside their designated speaking times , they should activate their microphone and state that they have a point of order . Those in the chamber can simply rise in the usual way . Please note that today 's proceedings will be televised in the same way as a typical sitting of the House . Next we 'll move on to ministerial announcements . I understand that there are no ministerial announcements today , so we 'll move on to petitions . We 'll be presenting petitions for a period not exceeding 15 minutes . I would like to remind members that any petition presented during a meeting of the special committee must have already been certified by the clerk of petitions . For members participating in person , we ask that they please come and drop the signed certificates off at the table once the petitions are presented . First on our list for presenting petitions is Ms. May , who is joining us virtually . Ms. Elizabeth May (SaanichGulf Islands, GP) : Mr . Chair , what an honour to be the first voice coming to you from the screens on either side of the Speaker of the House . I speak to you from SaanichGulf Islands on the traditional territory of the WSNEC people . Hych'ka Siem . I 'm presenting a petition , number 431-00215 , and it has been certified . The petitioners call on this House to take note of the fact that Canada is the only country with a universal health care system that does not include the provision of necessary prescription medications . They note that the system across Canada is a patchwork that leaves three million Canadians unprepared and uninsured to be able to purchase necessary medications . They call on the House assembled to put in place a system of universal national pharmacare , bringing down the cost of drugs through bulk purchasing . I think I 'll call that a summary , Mr . Chair . Thank you very much . The Chair : The next petition will be presented by Mr. Genuis . Mr. Garnett Genuis (Sherwood ParkFort Saskatchewan, CPC) : Thank you very much , Mr . Chair . I 'm pleased to be presenting two petitions before the committee today . The first petition is in support of Bill S-204 . This Senate public bill , been put forward by Senator Salma Ataullahjan in the Senate , would make it a criminal offence for someone to go abroad to receive an organ for which there has not been consent . It also has a mechanism by which somebody could be deemed inadmissible to Canada for being involved in the horrible practice of forced organ harvesting and trafficking . This bill has been before various Parliaments for over 10 years , and petitioners are hopeful that this Parliament will be the one that finally takes action to address forced organ harvesting and trafficking . The second petition is put forward by folks who are concerned about Bill C-7 , particularly the efforts by the government through Bill C-7 to remove vital safeguards that are currently associated with Canada 's euthanasia regime . Petitioners are not happy about the fact that the government is trying to eliminate the 10-day reflection period and remove other safeguards that only four short years ago the government thought were essential for the euthanasia and assisted suicide system that they were putting in place . The petitioners call on the government to address that , and they are not supportive of these particular efforts to remove vital safeguards from that regime . Thank you very much . The Chair : Is anyone else presenting petitions ? Seeing none , we 'll move on to statements by members . We will now proceed to Statements by Members for a period not exceeding 15minutes . Each statement will be for one minute . The first will be from Mr.Samson . Mr.Samson , you have the floor . Mr. Darrell Samson (SackvillePrestonChezzetcook, Lib.) : Good afternoon , everyone . It 's an honour to be presenting an S. O . 31 . This spring has been a difficult one for Nova Scotia and the communities of SackvillePrestonChezzetcook . While residents have banded together to tackle the challenges presented by COVID-19 , we have also had to mourn the passing of three remarkable local women : RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson , well known by many in Cole Harbour and the surrounding areas ; our own Sub-Lieutenant Abbigail Cowbrough , who was based out of 12 Wing Shearwater ; and Captain Jenn Casey of the Canadian Forces Snowbirds . All three women died in the line of duty in separate tragic events while serving our country . These three brave women , who served with honour on land , at sea and in the air , represent the absolute best of us . Heidi , Abbigail and Jenn were inspirational and will not be forgotten . Thank you . The Chair : Next we 'll go to Mr. Bezan . Mr. James Bezan (SelkirkInterlakeEastman, CPC) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . Canada needs a prime minister who will create jobs and opportunity , but instead we have a prime minister who is piling up crippling national debt . Yesterday the PBO predicted the federal deficit this year will hit over $ 252 billion . That is almost equivalent to an average year of government spending before the Liberal government . After five years with this debt , Prime Minister , Canada 's national debt is set to hit $ 1 trillion , with almost nothing to show for it . Industries from coast to coast are either closed or are struggling . Canadian workers need and deserve a prime minister who supports our energy sector and gets our natural resources and agriculture products to market , who supports small business and will make our tax system encourage job creation and growth , and who will bring advanced manufacturing jobs to Canada and keep the automotive industry growing . Most importantly , we need a Conservative prime minister who will get the government finances under control after the massive debt left by this prime minister . The Chair : Next we 'll go to Mr. Anandasangaree . Mr. Gary Anandasangaree (ScarboroughRouge Park, Lib.) : Mr . Chair , I speak today with a very heavy heart . Since the COVID-19 outbreak , we 've seen a disproportionate number of deaths in long-term care homes . I 'm thankful for the Canadian Armed Forces who were deployed to the Altamont care home in my riding and four other facilities across the GTA . The CAF have brought forward horrifying allegations in the operation of these homes . They include residents being given expired or improper doses of medication ; not being cleaned or changed for a prolonged period of time ; being forcibly fed , causing choking ; being bed-bound for weeks ; receiving inadequate nutrition , and much more . Mr . Chair , I call upon Premier Ford to place these five homes under a mandatory management order and to appoint a third party manager to address and rectify these violations . I also call upon the Premier to undertake an independent public inquiry into the tragedy we face in long-term care facilities across Ontario . Finally , Mr . Chair , we need to work with the provinces and territories to set national standards of care for the most vulnerable in our society . We can and must do better . Thank you , Mr . Chair . The Chair : We have a point of order . Go ahead , Ms. May . Ms. Elizabeth May : Thank you , Mr . Chair . I hesitate to interrupt colleagues , but I 'm concerned about the petition practice , which , as I understand it , is to summarize a petition but not make a speech . I felt one of our colleagues was trespassing on our usual rules . The Chair : I will remind honourable members that when a petition is presented , we 're expected to give a prcis and make it as concise as possible . Thank you . Mr.Champoux , you have the floor . Mr. Martin Champoux (Drummond, BQ) : Mr.Chair , I would like to recognize the resilience of Quebeckers concerned for their jobs or their businesses during the COVID-19 crisis . They need us to plan for after the crisis , and we must do so now . To do so , we need the proper information . We need to know the status of the public finances . That is why the Bloc Qubcois is demanding that the government present an economic update , and that it do so before June17 . This is not about making a spectacle . Everyone knows that the deficit will be huge . We had to provide the people with support and we all agree on that . But we have to know to what extent . We also have to know where we are starting from so that we can plan where we are going . This is about respecting the public , because they are the ones who will be paying the bill . In closing , I would like to remind the government that one group is not really contributing to the public purse at the moment . I am talking about the tech giants , the GAFAM group , that have never before been used to the extent that they are now , and that are still not paying a cent in tax in Canada . The Liberals promised to correct this injustice . Now is a great time for them to do so . The Chair : We 'll now go to Ms. Sidhu . Ms. Sonia Sidhu (Brampton South, Lib.) : Mr . Chair , this week is National Paramedic Services Week . I want to take this opportunity to thank the Peel region police , paramedic and firefighting services for keeping Bramptonians safe . In my riding , organizations have stepped up to help our community . Organizations such as the Khalsa Aid Society , the Interfaith Council of Peel , the Brampton YMCA , the Prayer Stone Peoples Church , Unity in the Community , Ste . Louise Outreach Centre , Knights Table , the Yogi Divine Society , Vraj Community Service , Regeneration Brampton and many more have made our community stronger during this difficult time . I also have to address the report that came out yesterday from our brave Canadian Armed Forces . Like many Canadians , I was shocked by this report from the long-term care centres , including one in my riding . The examples of abuse described in the report are unacceptable . Our seniors deserve dignity and respect . We must find a solution . We need to fix this . The Chair : We 'll now go to Mrs. Stubbs . Mrs. Shannon Stubbs (Lakeland, CPC) : Mr . Chair , Canada 's oil and gas sector is in crisis , made worse by five years of bad policies , red tape and barriers to pipelines . Just in the last two months , we saw the largest production cut in Canadian history . Active rigs dropped by 92 % and tens of thousands of oil and gas workers lost their jobs , adding to the 200,000 since 2015 . Energy is Canada 's biggest investor , and exporting could lead the recovery if there are actions , not just words . On March 25 , the finance minister promised help in hours or days , not weeks , but he 's letting Canadians down . Sixty-three days later , small oil and gas companies still ca n't apply for BDC loans , and last week 's large employer loan terms are predatory , with interest rates escalating to 14 % by year five . Those are payday loan rates . The required stock options being at record lows could make the government the largest shareholder . That 's not emergency assistance ; it 's pandemic profiteering . Programs ca n't help workers if businesses ca n't or wo n't actually get the support . The Liberals ' death-by-delay tactics are doing exactly what foreign activists in other countries want : to shut down Canada 's oil . The Chair : Ms.Bessette , the floor is yours . Mrs. Lyne Bessette (BromeMissisquoi, Lib.) : Mr.Chair , in times of crisis , we stick together . I can state that this is certainly the case in BromeMissisquoi . In the last weeks , I have been calling volunteer action centres in my constituency so that they can tell me their news . I would like to take the time that I have to highlight the work that community organizations are doing tirelessly in my constituency . The crisis has made us realize the extent to which food banks and meals-on-wheels can not only relieve hunger , but also relieve thousands of shut-in seniors of their loneliness . Let me also highlight the devotion of the volunteers giving generously of their time , particularly the initiative of Mabel Hastings in the volunteer aid centre in Mansonville . Like me , she sends out a daily newsletter to keep the public informed about the many resources available for their support . COVID-19 is bringing out the best in our community and I am certain that , together , we will get through it . The Chair : We will go to Mr. Virani . Mr. Arif Virani (ParkdaleHigh Park, Lib.) : Mr . Chair , during the COVID-19 pandemic I have been inspired by the courageous work of so many essential workers . I want to thank everyone on the front lines for keeping us safe , keeping us fed and keeping our communities functioning . I want to make special note of one particular essential health care worker , a woman who is a quarantine manager with the Public Health Agency of Canada . I have personally seen her working tirelessly over the past three months to keep all of us safe . That woman is my wife , Suchita Jain . Suchi , I love you , I am very proud of you and I thank you for all of the sacrifices you are making . I want to highlight another woman from my riding of ParkdaleHigh Park , Rachelle LeBlanc . She is a local designer . When the pandemic broke , she saw the need for protective barriers for small shops in Parkdale , so she set about collecting donations . She then put her design talents to work and started designing free-standing protective shields . Rachelle 's team has now delivered 25 free COVID protective shields to small shopkeepers in Parkdale , and the team is on track to building 100 more . It 's the compassion of Canadians like Rachelle that gives meaning to the phrase we are all in this together . The Chair : Mr.Godin , you have the floor . Mr. Jol Godin (PortneufJacques-Cartier, CPC) : Mr.Chair , the school year has been shattered and our graduating classes must be proud of what they have achieved amid the COVID-19 pandemic . Young men , young women , be proud of your accomplishments ! You can believe in the future . Keep learning . It will give you tools that will serve you all your lives . What you have achieved in this extraordinary year will set you apart from the others . I invite you to be inspired by that and turn it to your advantage . The current government has the obligation to promote the values that will lead you to become involved in your communities . Your willingness to learn or to work makes you into better citizens . Knowledge and experience are irreplaceable and invaluable . I implore this government , which is unaware of the damage it is causing , to immediately announce all the positions that have already been approved under the Canada summer jobs program . Urgent action is needed . Let us have confidence in our organizations , our companies , and let us support our youth , a rich resource that we must equip and motivate . I congratulate all the young graduates in the beautiful constituency of PortneufJacques-Cartier . The Chair : We will now go to Mr. Fergus . Mr. Greg Fergus (HullAylmer, Lib.) : Mr.Chair , this pandemic lets us see what Canadians are made of . This coming Saturday , May30 , more than 2,000Christians of all denominations are coming together virtually for prayer and for action . When the going gets tough , Canadians get going . This could not be more true than with respect to what will be happening on May 30 . This Saturday , in more than 2,000 churches and homes , thousands of faith-filled Canadians are gathering to pray and act on those prayers as part of Stand United Canada . They will gather through television , Facebook Live and Instagram Live . Then they are going to deliver much-needed support to at-risk Canadians who live in disadvantaged areas . This is faith in action . I 'm sure I speak for all parliamentarians when I wish success to Stand United Canada . I hope it inspires more Canadians to follow in its footsteps . Thank you , Mr . Chair . The Chair : We will now go to Ms . Harder . Ms. Rachael Harder (Lethbridge, CPC) : The best way to safeguard the truth is to allow people to speak freely , but from the very beginning of this pandemic , the Liberals have silenced dissent . Sadly , their short-sightedness has been to the detriment of Canadians . Early on , they propagated the notion that human-to-human transmission was n't possible . They said that closing the borders was n't necessary . They told us that wearing face masks would n't help . It is undeniable that the Liberal government has put Canadians in danger by silencing alternative points of view and has spread misinformation . Ironically , however , they have now gone ahead and crowned themselves the arbiters of truth . They are spending millions of dollars to censor what Canadians can and can not say . They are determining what is true and what is not , what is right and what is wrong , what is in and what is out . When freedom of speech is repressed , it is safe to say that democracy is under siege . I call upon the government to restore the personal liberties that are granted under our Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms . This is Canada . We are not an autocracy ; we are a democracy . The Chair : We will now go to Mr. Nater . Mr. John Nater (PerthWellington, CPC) : Mr . Chair , small businesses have always been the cornerstone of communities across this country . They provide employment and economic stability and are always the first to support community functions and activities , but small businesses have been particularly hard hit due to COVID-19 . They have shut their doors temporarily , and now many worry they 'll never be able to open their doors again . With the season cancellations at the Stratford Festival , Drayton Entertainment and Stratford Summer Music , businesses in the tourism , hospitality , accommodation and retail sectors in PerthWellington are struggling . Every day , I talk to small business owners who ca n't access the Canada emergency business account , and others who find the convoluted commercial rent assistance program to be out of reach . The program is needlessly complicated , frustratingly slow and excessively restrictive . Mr . Chair , the government needs to go back , fix these programs and ensure that support goes to the small businesses that need it . The Chair : We will now go to Ms. Collins . Ms. Laurel Collins (Victoria, NDP) : Mr . Chair , Canadians have been shaken by this pandemic . It has exposed the gaps in our health care system and our social safety net . It has shown how vulnerable we all are when disaster hits . It has brought us to a crossroads . We can go backwards to so-called business as usual , with horrific conditions in long-term care homes , widespread inequality and no real action on climate change , or we can build for better . In Victoria , people in the community , organizations and municipal leaders have been calling for a new way forward . The City of Victoria has a plan for reinvention , resilience and recovery . Organizations like Greater Victoria Acting Together ; Common Vision , Common Action ; and Kairos Victoria are exploring ideas for a sustainable and just recovery . We can build for better . We can invest in the infrastructure . We need to fight climate change , homelessness and inequality . We can build a Canada where we take better care of the planet and each other . The Chair : We now move to Ms.DeBellefeuille . Mrs. Claude DeBellefeuille (SalaberrySurot, BQ) : Mr.Chair , in this time of pandemic , it is with heartfelt emotion that I want to highlight the excellent work of all the guardian angels at the CISSS de la Montrgie-Ouest . From the bottom of my heart , I want to thank the entire staff , as well as the retirees who have come back to provide their assistance . I admire the managers , at all levels and in all services , working tirelessly so that their teams can answer the call in this difficult situation . My fellow managers and the management teams of the Support Program for the Autonomy of Seniors , both in home support and in residential care , you have my heartfelt congratulations for the herculean work you have done . My thoughts go particularly to Lyne Ricard and Vronique Proulx , managers working diligently with their teams of professionals to support the seniors living in intermediate resources , as we call them . I also warmly recognize the director of nursing services , Chantal Careau , who is facing the current challenge with passion and humanity . Once again , my congratulations go to the entire organization of the CISSS de la Montrgie-Ouest for their remarkable work in this difficult and very demanding time . The Chair : We will go to Mr. Barlow . Mr. John Barlow (Foothills, CPC) : During the worst of times , we see the best in people . Heroes are born , characters revealed , resiliency is sowed . I can not say enough about my constituents in Foothillsfront-line health care workers , grocery store clerks , restaurateurs , farmersfor all they are doing to keep our community safe and healthy . I want to shine a light on some of our hidden heroes , such as Owen Plumb , a grade 9 student in Okotoks who is using his 3D printer to build PPE for front-line health care workers . He partnered with the Rotary Club and Evergreen Solutions in Okotoks to help with the manufacturing and assembly . There is also Sam Schofield , the volunteer president of the Pincher Creek Chamber of Commerce , overnight built a resiliency website for COVID-19 by building training tools for businesses throughout his area . He also helped develop the Foothills Business Recovery Taskforce , which is a resource for businesses throughout southern Alberta in my riding . Finally , to the employees of Cargill Foods in High River , I know this has been a very difficult time and that many of you have lost loved ones . I want to say thank you for tirelessly doing all you can to protect our food supply and keep food on our table . Each and every one of you is a hero . Thank you . Some hon . members : Hear , hear ! The Chair : We will now go to Mr. Simms . Mr. Scott Simms (Coast of BaysCentralNotre Dame, Lib.) : Thank you , Chair . I would like to take this time to salute those who go above and beyond the call of duty to provide care and comfort to others . In my 16 years in the House of Commons I have never experienced anything like this , when we find our lives are at a standstill and there is so much sorrow felt by families who suffer from the effects of COVID-19 . However , here are two examples of kindness right here in Newfoundland and Labrador . Shanna and Fred Patey of Bishop 's Falls , along with a few of their friends , spend hours next to the Trans-Canada Highway with just a barbeque and a cooler . They serve free meals for truckers crossing our province each and every day . So far they have provided over 1,500 meals . There is also Mitch Strickland of Grand Falls-Windsor , who owns Appy 's Diner . He has continually provided food for the local hospital and other front-line workers through his donations . To all our front-line workers in grocery stores and delivery trucks , and to doctors , nurses , LPNs , paramedics , first responders and , of course , our brave women and men in the military , we will be forever grateful and blessed because of you . Thank you . Some hon . members : Hear , hear ! The Chair : That 's all the time we have today for Statements by Members . Before going on , I just want to remind all the members that it is a one-minute statement , so if you do n't mind , please time it before coming in because we do have limited time . The other thing that has come up is that some of you just naturally speak very quickly . I 'm not here to judge anybody 's way of speaking , but try to consider the translators and interpreters to make sure that everyone understands what is said , because they are working diligently to try to get both languages out . In sum , there are two things : please slow down and please make sure the statement is confined to one minute . We now move to Questions to Ministers . Please note that we will suspend the proceedings every 45minutes in order to allow the employees who are providing support for the sitting to substitute for each other safely . Our first question goes to the Leader of the Opposition , Mr. Scheer . Hon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition) : Thank you very much , Mr . Chair . In the early days of the pandemic and the lockdown that followed , Canadians were told by this government that programs would be rolled out very quickly and that gaps and shortcomings would be changed as time went on . While many Canadians are being let down by this government 's response and its unnecessarily rigid programs , Conservatives identified solutions weeks ago , yet here we are , two and a half months later , and many of these programs still have not been improved . I have a simple question for the Prime Minister . On April 26 the Conservatives asked the Prime Minister to change the criteria for the Canada emergency business account so that small businesses that do n't happen to have a business bank account could qualify for those types of programs . It 's now May 27 . Is the Prime Minister going to make that change ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister) : Mr . Chair , we knew from the beginning of this pandemic that we did need to move extremely quickly , and that 's what we did . We rolled out the Canada emergency response benefit extremely quickly . Eight million Canadians have had that as a replacement for paycheques lost because of COVID-19 . We also moved forward on the wage subsidy and a range of other programs to support workers and small businesses . What we 've done in terms of helping small businesses with the Canada emergency business account has had a massive impact on small businesses across the country , but we understand that certain companies and businesses have particularities that mean it 's a little more difficult for them to qualify . We are working with them through their regional development agencies , and we encourage them to approach their local RDAs , which will be able to help them get the money they deserve . Hon. Andrew Scheer : Mr . Chair , these are very simple technical fixes that can be made by this government . There 's no excuse for the delay . It 's May 27 . They 've known about these problems for weeks . They 're trying to get patted on the back for actions they took back in March , and yet they are letting so many Canadians down by not making these very simple changes . For example , companies that have acquired another company in the last year have employees whose jobs are threatened . The businesses are not allowed to qualify for the wage subsidy because their revenue is now counted together . We have identified this gap . Again , it 's a simple question . Will companies that have acquired another company still be allowed to use the wage subsidy to keep workers on the job , yes or no ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , I know that there are many different types of businesses across this country that need support . We have moved forward on supporting as many of them as we possibly can , and we continue to work on filling gaps . I know the member opposite has talked to me a number of times about a tractor company in his riding . I can assure you that finance officials are engaged with that company to see if there 's a way to make sure we 're getting them the support they need . Hon. Andrew Scheer : It 's actually a very simple fix . I can save him and his officials a lot of time . The government used the word amalgamation when it announced the changes to that program . He can make this very clear , and save a lot of work , just by including the word acquisition . Will he do that ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , I can assure you that finance officials are working closely with Brandt Tractor . They 're continuing to work with a range of businesses across the country that , for various reasons , are not able to apply for the help we have now . We will continue to work to make sure people who need the help get it . Hon. Andrew Scheer : Mr . Chair , it 's literally one word . We can email him the text . We can send him the page in the dictionary where that word is defined , if that would help . Another gap that is letting people down is in the rent relief program . The government has set the parameters to qualify for the rent relief program for companies that have experienced a 70 % revenue loss . There are untold thousands of businesses that have experienced a 50 % , 55 % , 60 % or 65 % loss that are ineligible but have no capacity to pay the rent . We called on the government weeks ago to have a more flexible sliding scale to allow more companies to access this program to keep more people on the job and more businesses open . Will the government introduce some flexibility to this program to help more businesses survive ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , from the beginning of this pandemic , our public servants and policy-makers have been moving creatively and quickly to try to get help to as many people as we possibly can , with our focus being on the people who need it the most . Obviously , this pandemic is affecting everyone and every business across the country in different ways , but our focus has been on ensuring that those who most need it are getting the help they can . We will , of course , continue to work with the parties opposite and all Canadians to ensure that we 're getting help to everyone who needs it , but our focus has always been on the most vulnerable , first and foremost . The Chair : The floor now goes to Mr.Blanchet . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet (BeloeilChambly, BQ) : Thank you , Mr.Chair . My question is for the Prime Minister . If the Liberal Party of Canada had not taken advantage of the emergency programs , would it have laid off all its staff ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , we recognized that a number of organizations and companies were facing difficulties because of COVID-19 . People work for those organizations , as accountants , receptionists , assistants or labourers , and those people need to be supported . We are supporting people all over the country through that program . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Is the Liberal Party one of those organizations in difficulty ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Any company or organization that can demonstrate a significant drop in its income , whether that be in donations , receipts , profits The Chair : The floor goes to Mr.Blanchet . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty , as an organization ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , we created specific criteria to help organizations in difficulty . Any organization experiencing those difficulties can apply . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : In the Magdalen Islands , fishing companies in difficulty and in need of assistance will not have the money that the Liberals are going to take . Is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty , as an organization ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , we have invested in assistance for fishers all across the country . We recognize that it is a difficult situation because of COVID-19 . We will be here for our fishers and for industries in difficulty . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : I am not catching many answers , it seems to me . A company in Drummondville that manufactures isolation membranes is in difficulty because a federal program is inadequate . Compared to that company , is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty , as an organization ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , there are clear criteria for submitting applications under these programs . Companies and organizations that receive money qualify for those programs . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : If the program criteria establish that the Liberal Party is an organization in difficulty , does that mean that the criteria to determine whether an organization is in difficulty are poorly designed ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , all through this pandemic , our priority has been to be here for workers in difficulty so that they do not lose their jobs . This applies to all organizations and companies in the country to the extent possible . That is what we are in the process of doing . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Given the answers from the Prime Minister , let me ask this question : is the Prime Minister in difficulty ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : No , Mr.Chair . We are doing important work for all Canadians , every day . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Restaurant owners on rue Ontario in Montreal feel that they will not make it through the crisis and that they will never open their doors again . They are in difficulty . By comparison , is the Liberal Party of Canada an organization in difficulty that will not open its doors again after the crisis ? We can but hope . Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , we established criteria for that program in order to help those working for various organizations . Any organization that receives the subsidy has qualified for it . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Is there a consensus in the Liberal Party caucus that the Liberal Party is in difficulty as an organization ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , we are working every day to help Canadians and workers in difficulty . We are going to continue to do that work . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Does answering a question put the Prime Minister in difficulty ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , it is a pleasure to be here in the House and to answer questions from Canadians and from members of the opposition . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : You are going to answer a question from a Quebecker , I hope . Companies are struggling in Saguenay , in the Gasp , in Beloeil . Would those companies not deserve to be saved by the money that the supposedly struggling Liberal Party has taken ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : I am always very happy to answer questions from all Canadians currently sitting in the House . We will be here to help workers in difficulty all across the country , including in Quebec . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : If the Prime Minister is so happy to answer questions , I hope he will be delirious with joy to answer this one . Is the Liberal Party in difficulty ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , we established a program to help those working in organizations and who could lose their jobs because of COVID-19 . We are here to help workers in organizations and companies all over the country . The Chair : We 'll now go on to Mr. Singh . Mr. Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, NDP) : Thank you very much , Mr . Chair . The conditions of seniors as outlined by the military were appalling , but seniors need more than just compassionate words . They need action . Will the Prime Minister stop hiding behind excuses and actually show leadership to fix long-term care ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , the Constitution of Canada is not an excuse . It lays out the divisions of powers and responsibilities , and we respect the provinces ' jurisdiction over long-term care facilities . However , from the very beginning , we have indicated our willingness to support the provinces on this very important issue . We need to make sure our seniors right across the country are properly cared for , which is why we sent in the military and why we are there to help the provinces . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : The former federal health minister , Dr. Philpott , said , We need to stop using jurisdiction as an excuse to not have federal leadership . That is a former federal health minister . Now , we know from the military report that staff were afraid to use vital equipment because of the cost . Will the Prime Minister call for an end to profit in long-term care ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , over the past couple of days I 've had very good conversations with the premiers of both Quebec and Ontario on this important issue . I look forward to discussing issues around long-term care with all the premiers of the provinces and territories tomorrow evening as well . This is something that Canadians have seen needs concerted action . We will be there to support the provinces . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : Needles were reused and expired medication was used , according to military reports . Will the Prime Minister call for an end to profit in the care of our seniors ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , the contents of that report were deeply disturbing and troubling for all Canadians . That is why we are committed to working with the provinces to fix this situation . Ontarians and indeed people right across the country are deeply preoccupied by what they 've seen going on . We need to fix this , and we will do that together . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : The military report found that cockroaches and flies were present and that food was rotten . Will the Prime Minister call for national standards so that long-term care is governed by the same principles as the Canada Health Act ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , our priority right now is ensuring that we are supporting the provinces in their need to make sure that all seniors are protected right across the country in all those institutions . Going forward , we absolutely will need to have more conversations about how we can ensure that every senior across the country is properly supported . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : The military report found that respecting the dignity of patients was not a priority . Will the Prime Minister call for national standards and for long-term care to be governed by the same principles as the Canada Health Act ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , all Canadians know we need to do better by our seniors . This is something we all take very seriously , and all orders of government will work together to make sure that right now , and going forward , we improve our systems . The federal government will be there to work with the provinces on making that happen . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : Mr . Chair , the Prime Minister has said that he 's willing to work with the provinces . I 'm saying that we need to see federal leadership . We need a commitment at the federal level that the Prime Minister will push for things that people need , which is to remove profit from long-term care and to establish national standards . Will the Prime Minister go beyond working with provinces and show some leadership ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , I will always be here to stand up for Canadians in all different situations . We are going to work with the provinces , fully respecting jurisdictions , to make sure that , all across the country , Canadians in long-term care are supported as required and receive the services and the care they deserve . The Chair : Mr. Singh , we have 30 seconds . Ask a brief question , please . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : Thank you very much . The COVID-19 crisis should not be used as an excuse to avoid presenting solutions to the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls committee , in particular by delaying action on the calls for justice . This is the same government that would not recognize it as a genocide , the same government that delayed the United Nations declaration legislation and the same government that is still taking indigenous kids to court . Will this government commit to core funding for indigenous services to help women and girls and ensure that the calls for justice are implemented without delay ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , we continue to work very closely with partners on the calls for justice even as we act in many areas , including better funding for shelters and for victims of domestic violence . We will continue to work with those partners , but people will understand that many of those partners are very focused right now on helping front-line workers , not on establishing the report . We will continue to work with them on the report , but the COVID-19 situation has made that more difficult . The Chair : I want to thank the honourable members who are shouting time , but I do have a timer here , and I am taking care of it . I appreciate the help , but I do want to remind them that I have the proper machinery here . We will now go to Mr. Bezan . Mr. James Bezan : Thank you , Chair . My question is to the Prime Minister . He was just talking about the tragic conditions in long-term care facilities in Ontario , and there was a report out from Quebec today . I want to commend the Canadian Armed Forces for witnessing these appalling conditions , putting it in the context of a report , and providing care to our loved ones in these long-term care facilities . The government is saying they did n't receive the report from the department until May 22 , but this report came out on May 14 . What happened to that report for eight days ? The Chair : We will go to the honourable minister . We seem to have a technical issue , Mr. Sajjan . We ca n't hear you . You might want to put down your bar and keep it down while you 're speaking . Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence) : Mr . Chair , I want to thank our Canadian Armed Forces members for the tremendous work they are doing . They did their duty , noted down their observations and reported them . While those observations were being reported directly to the managers , a report was being compiled . This report was given to me on the 21st . I then forwarded it to the Minister of Public Safety on the 22nd , and that report was then given to the provincial authorities very quickly afterwards . Mr. James Bezan : I trust that you got the report on the 21st , but the report was written on the 14th , so what happened with that report for seven days ? Why was n't it acted upon ? Could you just explain that ? Our loved ones were at risk during that entire time . Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan : Mr . Chair , as we stated , this report was done and given up through the chain of command , and the appropriate leadership did their due diligence . Once we received this report , it was forwarded to the appropriate authorities . Again , I want to commend our Canadian Armed Forces members for not only the tremendous work they are doing but also for doing their duty . Mr. James Bezan : That report from Ontario documented appalling conditions , horrific care that was being given to the clients , and also the way that the staff conducted themselves . We know that there are 39 members of the Canadian Armed Forces currently infected with COVID-19 . Minister , do you believe that the infection could have been transmitted from staff to our soldiers serving in long-term care facilities because proper protocols were not being followed ? Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan : Mr . Chair , when it comes to any type of activities that we send our Canadian Armed Forces on , we do our due diligence to make sure that we have the right protocols in place and the appropriate training . This is why we have taken the time to make sure our folks not only did the appropriate training but had the appropriate equipment . We have the right protocols in place , and we will make sure that our members who are infected by COVID will get the appropriate treatment as well . Mr. James Bezan : Does the Minister of National Defence believe that our soldiers serving in Operation Laser , who have put themselves in harm 's way in battling the COVID virus as a war , deserve to have hazard pay benefits ? Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan : Mr . Chair , when it comes to looking after Canadian Armed Forces personnel , yes , we are actually in the process as we speak of making sure that our members have the appropriate hazard pay . This is currently being drafted , and we will have more to say on this shortly . Mr. James Bezan : I hope that means it 's a yes . I do encourage the government to provide that compensation to our soldiers and troops serving in Operation Laser . I would finally like to come back to the issue of the timeline from May 14 to May 21 , when that report was in the department for one week . Under our parliamentary system , ministers are accountable for the conduct of their departments . Will the minister take responsibility for that report sitting on someone 's desk for seven days and not being turned over to the proper authorities ? Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan : Mr . Chair , I want to make it very clear : When it comes to the observations that were made , those were immediately reported to the appropriate management of the care facilities and to the appropriate links within the province . At the same time , this report was being compiled and pushed up to the chain of command , and they did their due diligence . As I stated , it was given to us , and on the same day it was forwarded to the Minister of Public Safety , who immediately then sent it to the provincial authorities . Mr. James Bezan : Was one of those authorities that this was sent to the RCMP ? Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan : Mr . Chair , as stated , this will not only be given to the proper authorities but the appropriate steps will be taken now . The Chair : We 'll now go to Ms. Falk . Ms. Falk . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk (BattlefordsLloydminster, CPC) : Thank you , Chair . Yesterday it was revealed that the Minister of Digital Government has been promoting a fundraising campaign to sue Global News for their story criticizing the Chinese Communist Party . Why is the minister using her authority to support the Communist Party of China and threatening our media and freedom of expression ? Hon. Joyce Murray (Minister of Digital Government) : Mr . Chair , we value the important work of media right across the country . Attacking the integrity of hard-working journalists is simply not acceptable . Like many members on all sides of the House .... WeChat is a social media platform used to engage and share information with The Chair : Now we 'll go back to Ms. Falk . Ms. Falk . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Is the minister aware of the efforts that the United Front carries out on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party to influence how Canadians view the People 's Republic of China ? Hon. Joyce Murray : Thank you for that question . Mr . Chair , I want to just be clear . The participation in the WeChat group , much like Facebook , is guided by posted The Chair : We 'll now go back to Ms. Falk . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Is the minister an active participant in the efforts by the Communists to muzzle a Canadian journalist and deprive Canadians of the facts about China ? Hon. Joyce Murray : Muzzling journalists is never acceptable , and our government is very clear on that . I will say that the individual in question posted something outside of the guidelines of my WeChat group and is no longer The Chair : We 'll now go back to Ms. Falk . Ms. Falk , I just want to point out that we do have interpreters listening and trying to interpret . They 'd appreciate it .... Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : My questions are short . That 's probably what it is . The Chair : Take a deep breath . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Chair , the Liberals ca n't shrug this off . The minister admitted to theBreaker that her own political staff manages this WeChat . This is someone who is paid by Canadian taxpayers . Why is the minister using tax dollars to help China attack Global News and freedom of expression ? Hon. Joyce Murray : I think the member knows very well that the people who post on WeChat are free to post what they choose within certain guidelines . Those guidelines were ignored . That person is no longer part of my WeChat group . The post was completely unacceptable , and I do not share the views of the individual . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Chair , Sam Cooper is an investigative Canadian journalist who has uncovered many different criminal rackets that can be linked back to Beijing . Has the minister apologized to Sam Cooper for attempting to shut down his work ? Hon. Joyce Murray : As we all know , community outreach is a very important part of the work of a member of Parliament . WeChat is one of many social media sites regularly used by members The Chair : We go back to Ms. Falk . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Chair , when will the minister apologize to Sam Cooper and Global News ? Hon. Joyce Murray : Mr . Chair , I have been very clear that I do not share the views of the person who posted on my WeChat site , who operated outside of my The Chair : We 'll now go back to Ms. Falk . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Chair , in December 2018 the Liberals passed Bill C-76 . This included provisions to prevent foreign interference in Canadian society . Does the government believe that Joyce Murray 's actions have violated this portion of the act ? Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) : Mr . Chair , I want to assure the member that we are always vigilant in any foreign interference in our national security or issues of political interference in our society . It 's monitored carefully by the national security establishment , according to the law as it exists in this country , and we will remain vigilant . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Chair , in May 2019 , the Liberals launched their digital charter . One of the principles was strong democracy , a commitment to defend freedom of expression . Will the Liberals hold Joyce Murray 's WeChat accountable if it has violated this part of the charter ? Hon. Bill Blair : Mr . Chair , we are absolutely committed to the rule of law and will always uphold it . I think , as the minister has made very clear , she was not involved in this process and has no control over the individual who posted that matter . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Chair , unfortunately I do n't believe that was a sufficient answer . This is really a yes or no . Will the government hold Joyce Murray 's WeChat accountable if it has violated their part of the charter ? Hon. Bill Blair : Again , Mr . Chair , I want to assure the member that our government remains committed to the rule of law and we will always work tirelessly to uphold the laws of this country . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Is that a yes or a no ? Hon. Bill Blair : Again , I think it was very clear . We will always uphold the laws of Canada . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Still , was that a yes or a no ? I 'm not hearing a yes or a no . Hon. Bill Blair : I am doing my very best , Mr . Chair , to answer the question for the House and to assure the member opposite that our government will always remain committed to the rule of law . That is unequivocal . The Chair : We will now move on to the honourable member . The floor is yours , Mr.Deltell . Mr. Grard Deltell (Louis-Saint-Laurent, CPC) : Thank you , Mr.Chair . I am very happy and proud to be participating in this discussion in the House of Commons today . My question is very simple : how much is Canada 's deficit ? Hon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance) : Mr.Chair , we continue to be transparent with our measures . Of course , we want to make sure that our investments , our economy The Chair : The floor is yours , Mr.Deltell . Mr. Grard Deltell : Let me ask my question to the honourable Minister of Finance once more , since he is talking about transparency . My question is really simple : how much is Canada 's deficit ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , our economic situation is very fluid . We have made major investments and we are making sure that our economy is working . Mr. Grard Deltell : Mr.Chair , the minister 's answer is not fluid at all . But the question is really simple : how much is Canada 's deficit ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , it is important to be transparent with our investments . We look at the investments and the figures every day . Mr. Grard Deltell : Mr.Chair , the Minister of Finance may not know what the deficit is , but one great Canadian does know . And he knows that he knows . Could the Minister of Finance be very clear , very fluid and , above all , very transparent with Canadians ? What is Canada 's deficit ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , I want to be very clear with Canadians : our economic situation is very difficult . The situation is fluid . We are making investments to ensure that our economy will be strong in the future . Mr. Grard Deltell : Mr.Chair , with all due respect to the Minister of Finance , let me point out that , though he is not very clear , Canada 's Parliamentary Budget Officer was clear yesterday . The deficit is $ 260billion . That is the real number . Why does the government not have the courage to state it clearly , as the Parliamentary Budget Officer did yesterday ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we always want to be clear and transparent . It is very important for the situation to be stable in order to ensure our future . That is our economic approach . We are making investments now so that the situation becomes more stable . Mr. Grard Deltell : Mr.Chair , I know that the Minister of Finance is very good with figures . But he is not able to give us one . Perhaps he could comment on the statement that the Parliamentary Budget Officer made yesterday , that the emergency assistance must have an end date , and if it does not , we are heading to levels of taxation that have not been seen in this country for generations . What is the government going to do to make sure that Canadians will not be overtaxed after this crisis ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we think it 's very important to make investments . That way , we will have a resilient economy in the future . That 's very important . That way , we know that we 'll have a good economy in the future . When we have more information , we will The Chair : Mr.Deltell , you have the floor . Mr. Grard Deltell : Mr.Chair , will the minister commit not to raise taxes after the crisis ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , I have said several times that we do not have a plan to raise taxes . That 's very important . Mr. Grard Deltell : Finally a clear answer ! However , I 'm not convinced that he will apply it . In fact , the Parliamentary Budget Officer himself has said that there is n't much ammunition left without shifting into a large structural deficit , which can lead directly to tax increases . If the Minister of Finance ca n't even say today what the deficit is today , how can he be credible when he says that he wo n't raise taxes ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , I think what 's most important is that during this pandemic , Canadians and companies across the country need the Government of Canada 's help . That is our approach . That way , we will have an economy that will function in the future . Of course , this is important for future generations . Mr. Grard Deltell : When will there be an economic update ? Hon. Bill Morneau :  Mr. Grard Deltell : Mr.Chair , all observers are expecting an economic update to know where we 're going . When will that happen ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we want our economic update to be accurate . That 's why we are looking at information that allow us to make good forecasts . The Chair : We 'll now go to Mr. Hoback . Mr. Randy Hoback (Prince Albert, CPC) : Mr . Chair , the United States , Australia , India , Japan , New Zealand , South Korea and Vietnam have created an economic prosperity group to diversify some of their key supply chains away from China . Canada has a free trade agreement with six of these seven countries . Why are we not part of this group ? Hon. Mary Ng (Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade) : Mr . Chair , I thank the hon . member for that question . Indeed , we have been working diligently with all of these countries to make sure that we are keeping global supply chains open during this critical time . I think everyone agrees that keeping supply chains open for medical goods , critical agriculture and essential goods is absolutely essential and The Chair : We 'll go back to Mr. Hoback . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , this government is refusing to come to terms with what COVID-19 will mean for the future of international trade . Why is Canada not at the table with our largest trading partner protecting the viability of our international supply chains and capitalizing on the opportunities of others doing the same ? The Chair : Before we go to the minister , one of the members has his mike still on , and I would ask that he turn it off . I am hearing background noise . The hon . minister . Hon. Mary Ng : Mr . Chair , Canada has unprecedented access to a number of markets around the world because of the extraordinary agreements that we have made to provide access to customers in those international markets . During COVID-19 , we have been working with our G20 partners . I have had two meetings with G20 trade ministers on the importance of keeping supply chains The Chair : We 'll go back to Mr. Hoback . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , is this payback for the Prime Minister snubbing these countries at the original TPP signing ? Hon. Mary Ng : Mr . Chair , we have a CPTPP arrangement with these countries , and we are looking forward to making sure that we get Canadian businesses growing into those markets . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , the U.K. will begin applying tariffs at the beginning of next year on Canadian exports such as seafood , beef and cars . These are the items that have had tariffs removed under CETA . Will the government commit to having a new trade agreement with the U.K. in place by January 1 ? Hon. Mary Ng : Mr . Chair , we are monitoring the situation very carefully . The U.K. , of course , is a very important trading partner for Canada . They are in discussions right now . I want to assure Canadian businesses that CETA continues to apply to our trade with the U.K. during this period while they go through Brexit . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , after CUSMA , this government guaranteed to the trade committee that they would publish the objectives of any new trade agreement . When will we see these objectives published and actually have a chance to view them ? Hon. Mary Ng : Mr . Chair , we look forward to working to ensure that those objectives are published as we get into future trade discussions . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , the resignation of the WTO director-general at this unprecedented time is concerning for the international trade community . Is the government committed to supporting a DG candidate who is dedicated to the massive reforms needed to get the WTO functioning again ? Hon. Mary Ng : Mr . Chair , I want to thank the hon . member for that good question . The Ottawa group , led by Canada , is working with like-minded countries on the reform of the WTO . We 've been doing this work and we continue to do this work . I look forward to making sure that we are leading the way on those discussions with like-minded The Chair : Mr. Hoback . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , last week the President of the United States considered blocking cattle imports . Our beef producers do n't need this . They need stability . Three-quarters of Canada 's beef cattle exports go to the U.S. Has the government sought out and received assurances from the United States that no such action will apply to Canadian cattle ? Hon. Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs) : Mr . Chair , we have an excellent assurance of our trade with the United States , which is our new NAFTA trade agreement that we have negotiated , thanks to the unprecedented co-operation across this country . It is very important to the Canadian economy and Canadian producers . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , going forward post-COVID , there are a lot things that will be changing in supply chains . What is this government doing proactively to look at opportunities in these supply chains that Canadian businesses can take advantage of ? Hon. Mary Ng : Mr . Chair , we continue to work with countries around the globe to ensure that Canada 's supply chains and those global supply chains , particularly for essential goods , for agricultural products , for medical supplies , continue to remain open . We will keep doing this work . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , on the agriculture side , canola farmers would like to know the status of canola going into China . Can she update the House on that status ? Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food) : Mr.Chair , I want to assure my colleague that we are continuing to work with our industry representatives , our allies and our trading partners in China . The Chair : We 'll now go to Ms. McLeod . Mrs. Cathy McLeod (KamloopsThompsonCariboo, CPC) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . Senior Canadian bureaucrats received very credible reports in early January that China was procuring and hoarding PPE . As a member of cabinet , was the health minister aware ? Hon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health) : Mr . Chair , from the very beginning of the outbreak in early January we were aware of the challenges our health sector would face , and we immediately began to work with the provinces and territories to understand what the need would be and how we could best prepare . Mrs. Cathy McLeod : In April , the minister stated there were not enough supplies in the national emergency stockpile . Can she explain why she approved a donation of 16 tonnes of PPE for China on January 31 , claiming it would not compromise our supply ? She ca n't have it both ways . We do n't have enough ; we have enough and it wo n't compromise it . Hon. Anita Anand (Minister of Public Services and Procurement) : Mr . Chair , we are operating in a highly competitive global environment , and the reality is that we need to make sure we have multiple complementary supply chains operating at the same time , which we have been doing in the past weeks and months , to ensure our front-line health care workers have the supplies they need to keep Canadians safe . That 's our priority . That 's what we 're working on . Mrs. Cathy McLeod : Unfortunately , this question was directed to the health minister , referencing things she actually stated in terms of the availability of our supplies . Before the she signed off on the donationand it was the health minister who signed off on the donationdid she consult with the health ministers in the provinces and territories ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , as the member opposite knows , provinces and territories have their own stockpiles , which of course they use to prepare for incidences of outbreak and other illnesses across their jurisdictions . We 've worked very closely with the provinces and territories since the beginning of the outbreak to make sure we can provide any particular additional support . In fact , of all the requests made so far , we have been able to complete them . Mrs. Cathy McLeod : Health care workers are now having to look at modified full-face snorkels as an alternative to N95 masks . Did it not occur to the minister that our hospitals and care homes could have used that PPE she shipped out , providing a longer opportunity for them to also get procurement done ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , as the member opposite knows , the equipment that was donated when China was in its outbreak was an important donation of nearly expired or expired goods that it was in desperate need of in its effort to try to contain the virus . As the member opposite knows , we 've been able to work successfully with provinces and territories to ensure they have what they need . Mrs. Cathy McLeod : Mr . Chair , I would suggest that during February and March our hospitals would have consumed that almost-expired product very efficiently , but I want to move on to another topic . When defending the sale of 22 seniors ' homes to the Chinese government , the Prime Minister stated that we have a strong regulatory regime that imposes rigorous standards . He said that this regime ensures the care our seniors get is top quality . That was in 2017 . Now he states he is saddened , shocked , disappointed and angered . Was the Prime Minister completely oblivious to the risks , or was he just too anxious to please the Chinese government when he sold those 22 homes ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , the homes the member opposite is referring to are in the province of B.C. , and I have to commend the province for the early work it did to protect seniors in those long-term care homes . The member opposite is trying to confuse the issue . As she knows , the review we did was entirely separate from the standards to which the province holds the care homes . Mrs. Cathy McLeod : The Prime Minister does not have authority over seniors ' homes , which he has clearly stated , but he does have authority over the act in which he approved the sale . At 18 months , government had an obligation to make sure there was compliance . Was that done ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , the long-term care homes in each province fall within the jurisdiction of their own particular act , and those provinces and territories are responsible for fulfilling the inspections required under that act . Mrs. Cathy McLeod : Under the Investment Canada Act , the government is obligated to review the sale for compliance . Four homes had to close . Since the government approved the sale , it is complicit in the care of our seniors in this country Hon. Navdeep Bains (Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry) : Mr . Chair , I want to make it very clear that we understand how difficult this is for seniors . That is why we follow the appropriate steps , outlined under the Investment Canada Act , to make sure that any measures we take keep seniors and their well-being first and foremost . The Chair : Mr.Therrien , you now have the floor . Mr. Alain Therrien (La Prairie, BQ) : Mr.Chair , during the pandemic , the government has given money to companies that do n't pay a cent in tax because they use tax havens . We told the government that it did n't make sense . The government 's response was that it is no big deal . During the pandemic , the government gave money to Air Canada , but Air Canada never reimbursed customers who did not get the services they paid for . We told the government that it did not make sense . The government 's response was that it was no big deal . During the pandemic , the Liberal Party used the emergency wage subsidy to fund partisan activities . We told them that it did not make sense . The government responded that it was no big deal . Is the moral of the story that the government thinks that dipping into the pockets of taxpayers to spend money carelessly is no big deal ? Hon. Diane Lebouthillier (Minister of National Revenue) : Mr.Chair , the fight against tax evasion is a priority for our government . We will continue to target companies that use tax evasion schemes . Let me be clear : in everything we do , we will target companies and not innocent workers . Employees are employees , no matter who they work for . Mr. Alain Therrien : Mr.Chair , when I see that it 's the Minister of National Revenue answering me , I do n't feel like buying a lottery ticket . The Liberal Party used two airplanes in its last election campaign , which seems to indicate that it is n't short of money . However , the Liberals used the emergency wage subsidy . Why ? Is it because they want taxpayers to fund a third airplane ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we think it 's very important to protect employees across the country and in every economic sector that 's experiencing a significant drop in income . That 's the approach we 've taken to protect people and to ensure that there will be jobs in the future . We will continue this approach . Mr. Alain Therrien : It 's especially important to protect the employees who work for the Liberals to ensure their re-election , yet the Liberal Party has raised more than $ 7million since the last election . Is the party in jeopardy ? Can it go bankrupt ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , as I said , our approach is to protect employees . We think that this principle is very important and that this approach must be maintained in order to have a better job market in the future . Mr. Alain Therrien : Mr.Chair , we still do n't know exactly how much money the Liberals took from the cookie jar . We think they may have taken as much as $ 1million . How many SMEs could have been saved with the $ 1million that the Liberals took out of the jar and took away from SMEs ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we appreciate the question . We are protecting hundreds of thousands of SMEs through the emergency wage subsidy , the Canada emergency response benefit and all our programs . We will continue this approach to help SMEs and their employees . Mr. Alain Therrien : Mr.Chair , I will propose a choice of answers , or I wo n't get any . When did the government decide to use the emergency wage subsidy ? Now here are three possible answers . The first possible answer is that when the Liberals brought in the emergency wage subsidy , they set parameters allowing them to use it . The second is that when the Liberals saw the Conservative Partywhich is as rich as they are , but also sanctimonious and self-righteoustake advantage of the subsidy , they thought they could do it too . The third possible answer is that the Liberals had n't planned to use the subsidy , but they pounced on the cookie jar when they saw it , because that 's what they do . Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we continue to think it is very important to protect employees in every sector of the economy and across Canada . That 's our approach , and I believe it 's the right one to protect and preserve jobs across the country during a pandemic . The Chair : We are now going to suspend the proceedings for a few seconds to allow the employees who provide support for the meeting to replace each other safely . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton (Simcoe North, CPC)) : We will now resume the discussion . We 'll continue with Ms. Khalid , the honourable member for MississaugaErin Mills . Ms. Iqra Khalid (MississaugaErin Mills, Lib.) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . I 'll be splitting my time with the member for PickeringUxbridge . Mr . Chair , when the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces stepped in to provide support to five long-term care homes in Ontario at the request of the premier , they released a report that outlined their findings in detail . Military members witnessed residents ' cries for help going unanswered . They saw force-feeding . They saw bug infestations , a lack of personal protective equipment and neglect . Canadians are shaken . They are appalled by the horrific conditions outlined in the military report . Almost 1,000 seniors so far have lost their lives in long-term care homes in Ontario alone , over 25 of them in my riding of MississaugaErin Mills . These deaths could have been prevented . Can the Minister of Health please update the House on how our federal government is working with the provinces and territories to prevent further tragic occurrences from happening at long-term care homes and to ensure that our most vulnerable seniors are properly looked after and cared for ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , it 's such an important question . I believe all Canadians were deeply horrified to read the details from the Canadian Armed Forces on the conditions in long-term care homes in Ontario . What 's happening to seniors in Ontario is completely unacceptable . The report is very troubling . Seniors deserve to live with dignity , with respect and with safety . While long-term care is provincially regulated , we know that we need to work together . The Government of Canada stands ready to support provinces and territories as they continue to respond to this crisis . I had a very good conversation with my provincial and territorial counterparts last night about the work we can do at a national level to support their important work . We also know that seniors want to stay at home longer . That 's why our historic investment of $ 6 billion in home care was so important . We 'll continue to work with the provinces and territories to ensure that they get the care and dignity they deserve . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll go now to Ms. O'Connell . Ms. Jennifer O'Connell (PickeringUxbridge, Lib.) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . I will sadly report that my community of Pickering has experienced the largest number of deaths at a single COVID-19 outbreak location anywhere in this country . Seventy residents at Orchard Villa long-term care home died during this pandemic . It was a devastating blow to our community . Yesterday , we received the horrific report from the Canadian Armed Forces detailing what they witnessed at Orchard Villa in Pickering , Altamont Care Community in Scarborough , Eatonville Care Centre in Etobicoke , Hawthorne Place in North York , and Holland Christian Homes ' Grace Manor in Brampton . The loved ones of those who have passed away , as well as the homes ' workers , have asked for a full public inquiry from the Ontario government . I know that the responsibility for these facilities falls within provincial jurisdiction , but on behalf of our communities , can the Minister of Health update us on the work she is doing to ensure that the Ontario government takes action immediately and initiates a full , independent , non-partisan public inquiry and reverses its decision to create a government-led commission that wo n't even start until September ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , I would say that all Canadians were shocked and horrified to hear about the conditions that existed in these particular care homes . We 're so grateful to the members of the armed forces who not only improved conditions but also reported them quickly and appropriately to ensure amelioration of those conditions for those particular individuals . We also know that there are seniors all across the country who are struggling with care and with the appropriate level of care . We have to do better as a country . These are our loved ones . These are our parents and our grandparents . These are the people in our lives who have given so much to us . I stand committed to working with my provincial and territorial counterparts to ensure that we do better as a society . We know that there 's a role we can play at the federal level with advice , with guidance , with support and , yes , with investments . We look forward to having those conversations about how best we can improve the care for all seniors amongst us . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll go now to Mr. Davies from Vancouver Kingsway . Mr. Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway, NDP) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . Canadians were horrified to hear the report yesterday from our armed forces about the appalling conditions experienced by seniors in our long-term care homes . Page after page detailed the filth , neglect , abuse and danger our seniors in care are exposed to on a daily basis . Shockingly they face injury and death through missed medications , expired medications , unsterile devices and violations of basic contagion rules to stop the spread of COVID-19 . Given that evidence of possible criminal conduct was contained in the military 's report , will the minister refer this matter to the RCMP for investigation immediately ? Hon. Bill Blair : Mr . Chair , thanks very much to the member for those expressions of concern , which we share . We understand in long-term care facilities both seniors and persons living with a disability face unique challenges , and the findings of this report are in fact deeply concerning and completely unacceptable . Considering the severity of this report , we promptly shared it with the Province of Ontario , and the Province of Ontario has initiated an investigation based on the report 's findings . Their investigation includes alerting the province 's chief coroner who has the authority to alert the police of jurisdiction . We will continue to work with the province to protect those living in long-term care facilities , and we continue to support them through the deployment of our outstanding Canadian Armed Forces and in our partnership with the Red Cross . Mr. Don Davies : Mr . Chair , that 's a shocking answer considering there 's clear evidence of criminal conduct and negligence in this . That this federal government is not taking immediate steps to refer this to the nation 's RCMP is unacceptable . The seniors care crisis is a national problem . COVID-19 has exposed critical vulnerabilities across Canada 's entire network of long-term care facilities . Not a single province or territory currently meets the benchmark of 4.1 hours of hands-on care per day . As a result Canada has the worst record of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care among 14 comparable countries , with over 80 % of Canadian fatalities occurring in these facilities . Will this government move swiftly to establish binding national standards for long-term care ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , the member opposite is exactly correct when he says that those who are hardest hit in terms of losing their lives and the negative effects of COVID are those who are living in long-term care homes . He 's also correct when he indicates that COVID-19 has shown us what many of us have known for a long time , that we need to do better in long-term care and supports for seniors . As the member knows , we started those steps some four years ago or so when we began to make incredible investments in aging at home . We know that is one part of the solution , but we have to do better for those seniors who need a higher level of care . That 's the work I 'm doing now . I 'm working with my colleagues at the provinces and territories to make sure that we come up with a solution that will truly result in better standards for all . Mr. Don Davies : Mr . Chair , what we need is binding national standards , just like we set through the Canada Health Act in the health care sector generally . Gross fecal contamination , filthy medical equipment , insect infestations , ignoring patient cries for hourswe would never tolerate these conditions in Canada 's hospitals . There 's no reason to accept them in Canada 's long-term care facilities . Will the minister move to bring long-term care facilities under the Canada Health Act , or similar legislation , with formal funds tied to acceptable standards of care for our seniors , just like we do for hospitals ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , the member shares the disgust and concern of so many Canadians across the country , not only those who have read the report but many of those who have struggled to provide care to elders in those long-term care homes , regardless of the province in which they live . We know we need to do better . We know that collectively , at all levels of government , we must do better for those people who cared for us and nurtured us all of those years . The member has my commitment that I will work with provinces and territories to find a solution forward to ensure that every person has the right to age with dignity and safety . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Mr. Davies , you have 15 seconds for another question , a short one , and leave time for a response . Mr. Don Davies : Thank you , Mr . Chair . These failures are the product of systemic neglect often motivated by prioritizing profit over the provision of adequate care . Does the minister agree that we should not be putting profits above the health care needs of Canada 's seniors ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , I believe that , when we commit to taking care of people , we must do so with the utmost care that is required . I know that provinces and territories have a lot of work to do . So do we , at the federal level , and obviously at the local level . We must all work together to protect those people in our lives who are most vulnerable , whether they be seniors , children or others . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We will now move on to Mr. Schmale , HaliburtonKawartha LakesBrock . Mr. Schmale , go ahead . Mr. Jamie Schmale (HaliburtonKawartha LakesBrock, CPC) : Thank you , Chair . According to Vaughn Palmer in an editorial in the Vancouver Sun regarding the secret Wet'suwet'en deal , Palmer writes : The hereditary chiefs calculated the two governments would sign despite the objections from the elected chiefs . They likewise got the terms they wanted in the MOU while giving up absolutely nothing . Just as they figured governments would keep the contents secret from the public . Can the minister describe another situation in which the federal government negotiated a secret deal of this magnitude with unelected people ? Hon. Carolyn Bennett (Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations) : I thank the member for his ongoing concern and I want to remind him that actually it is in keeping with the Supreme Court decision of 1997 that we were to now begin those conversations with the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs who took the case to the Supreme Court . As we 've said many times , this is not an agreement ; this is an MOU that establishes the path forward for the substantive discussions towards a final agreement , which would describe the future governance and the implementation of Wet'suwet'en rights and title . It is about a shared commitment . Mr. Jamie Schmale : Mr . Chair , if it is a shared commitment , why on the eve of the signing ceremony did the four elected chiefs denounce the hereditary chiefs for keeping them in the dark ? Hon. Carolyn Bennett : Again , it 's really important that the member understand that there was a process for the hereditary chiefs to go back to their communities and discuss with them . Any agreement after the good work that will happen now would have to go back and seek the approval of all of the communities . Mr. Jamie Schmale : Mr . Chair , the Burns Lake Band members are openly wondering if they 're still a band or if the few unelected hereditary chiefs will control everything now . Minister , can you assure them that going forward you will honour their concerns and take the time to listen ? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : I ask honourable members to still direct their questions through the chair . The honourable minister . Hon. Carolyn Bennett : Actually , the honourable member knows that the next steps include the further and ongoing engagement by the Wet'suwet'en in their house groups and that will include the six elected chiefs of the Wet'suwet'en nation , their community members and many others . This is about going forward and making sure that any The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We go back to Mr. Schmale . Mr. Jamie Schmale : Thank you , Chair . Cynthia Joseph , a chief councillor with the Hagwilget First Nation says the MOU between Ottawa , the province and the Wet'suwet'en hereditary chiefs was only shared with her community members on May 9 , two days after it was published in the media . Is this part of the open and transparent government all Canadians can expect of the Prime Minister ? Hon. Carolyn Bennett : Walking the path of reconciliation means that we work with our partners and there is a way that they do the work within their communities . It is going to be an agreement to begin the work , but any final agreement is going to have to be approved by all members of the nation in terms of developing a consensus for the agreement The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We go back to Mr. Schmale . Mr. Jamie Schmale : Thank you , Chair . Does the minister have any concerns regarding claims by several former female hereditary chiefs that they were stripped of their hereditary status because they did n't agree with the men ? Hon. Carolyn Bennett : Again , it is going to be really important that the work take place within the Wet'suwet'en nation to determine their future governance , to determine their way of working with Canada and to make sure The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We go back to Mr. Schmale . Mr. Jamie Schmale : Thank you , Chair . For some reason it seems to be a problem to stand up for these hereditary female chiefs who had their titles taken away . Does the minister plan on recognizing band council resolutions denying the authority of hereditary chiefs to sign any future agreements without consent of the elected chiefs and the 3,000 members within the Wet'suwet'en they represent ? Hon. Carolyn Bennett : I think the member must understand that , as we begin the work , the nation will do its work and then we will come to the table to determine what the governance would be . Will it be a hybrid model like at Heiltsuk , like Ktunaxa , like some of the communities developing their constitutions , developing their laws and deciding how they will determine their own governance and that partnership with Canada ? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Mr.Paul-Hus . Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus (CharlesbourgHaute-Saint-Charles, CPC) : Thank you , Mr.Chair . The current restrictions on non-essential travel at the border do not prevent people from claiming refugee protection if they have family in Canada . Why is the minister refusing to allow married people to cross the border ? Hon. Bill Blair : I want to thank the honourable member for a very important question . We have heard from many constituents and members of Parliament from right across the country who are expressing concern about non-status spouses being denied entry into the country because their travel is deemed to be non-essential . I 've recently been in touch with all of the provinces and territories because I think it 's very important that we have their support for any changes The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Mr.Paul-Hus , you have the floor . Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus : If I understand correctly , Mr.Minister , you are talking to provincial representatives , but a case like that of ChantalTremblay , for instance , is unacceptable . For two months now , she has been trying to bring her spouse to Canada , but it is n't working . Is there a way to issue a directive to border services officers that married spousesit 's often marriages with Americanscan cross the border to join their spouses in Canada ? Hon. Bill Blair : Just to be very clearagain , I thank the member opposite for the opportunity to clarify thisit is never our intention to separate families , but at the same time , we have imposed appropriate and necessary restrictions on non-essential travel . Our border services officers inquire of everyone coming to that border about the nature of their travel , and for non-citizens who come to that border seeking entry into Canada , if their entry is deemed non-essential , then they exercise their discretion not to allow The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Mr.Paul-Hus , you have the floor . Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus : Thank you , Mr.Chair . Information from the Canada Border Services Agency has just come out . Since March21 , 425,000people have flown into Canada . Among them were 295,000Canadians , which is n't a problem . However , 100,000foreigners have entered Canada , even though the border is supposedly closed . How does the minister explain the fact that 100,000people arrived in Canada by plane ? Hon. Bill Blair : Again , I thank the member opposite for the opportunity to clarify . We have imposed very significant restrictions on non-essential travel , but of course there are circumstances where individuals come to this country and their entry into Canada is deemed essential . For example , someone who is providing medical services and coming into Canada to provide those services would be deemed essential , because there is a great need among Canadians for those services . It 's dealt with on a case-by-case basis . As you can see by the numbers , we have had a very significant reduction in the travel of all non-Canadians to Canada over the past two months . Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus : So the minister confirms that the 100,000people who arrived by air were providing a service considered essential to Canada . I 'm not talking about the people who crossed the land border , but the people who came to Canada by air . Hon. Bill Blair : What I can tell you is that at all points of entry , including our air borders , we apply the standard that the travel must be deemed essential , and that determination is utilized to see if a person is eligible to enter into the country . Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus : We 're now learning that the Correctional Service of Canada 's investigation into the murder of MarylneLevesque is suspended due to the COVID-19 outbreak . Canadians are n't fooled ; they know full well that it is a political decision . All the technological means are available to allow the investigation to continue . I 'm proof of that today . Can the minister direct the Correctional Service of Canada to resume the investigation into the death of MarylneLevesque ? Hon. Bill Blair : Again , I thank the member for the question , because we know the concern of the people of Quebec , and the family of Ms. Levesque needs answers and deserves answers . That 's why we asked the Parole Board and the Correctional Service of Canada to convene a board of investigation . Clearly , during COVID transmission , the ability to conduct that investigation and to interview all of the witnesses became extremely difficult and has been temporarily suspended , but at the very earliest opportunity we remain resolute to resume that investigation and get to the bottom of it to provide the answers that the family deserves . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Mr.Paul-Hus , you have only 20seconds remaining . Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus : Mr.Chair , victims of crime are one of the segments of the population most affected by the crisis . As we know , the government refuses to allow victims of crime to participate in parole hearings . For the first time in its history , and to add insult to injury , the government has cancelled all activities related to Victims and Survivors of Crime Week , which was to take place next week . Why is the Prime Minister turning his back on victims ? Hon. Bill Blair : Again , at the earliest days of COVID , until arrangements could be put in place , there were restrictions on victims participating . We have put the systems in place to allow victims to present their evidence virtually , either by video or by phone , to ensure that their voices are heard in these important things . We very much respect and support the role of victims in these determinations , and we 're making every effort to ensure that they can participate . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll now to Mr. Cumming , Edmonton Centre . Mr. James Cumming (Edmonton Centre, CPC) : Mr . Chair , yesterday I asked the Minister of Small Business how many business credit availability guarantees were issued by EDC , and I did n't get a number . Does she have an exact , finite , number of the guarantees today ? Hon. Mary Ng : Mr . Chair , thank you to the honourable member for that question . Our government has taken swift and immediate action to support Canadian businesses through this time . Money from this program is flowing , and businesses across the country are receiving the important support that they need . Mr. James Cumming : How many BCAP applications have been received so far ? Hon. Mary Ng : Mr . Chair , these are large loans , and they require important due diligence and adjudication by the financial institutions . We will continue to be open and transparent as the accurate information becomes available . Mr. James Cumming : How long does it take to be approved for a BCAP guarantee ? Hon. Mary Ng : I want to assure the member that we 're going to do everything possible to support businesses and workers during this very important time . Mr. James Cumming : How many businesses have received funding under the BCAP co-lending program since March ? Hon. Mary Ng : The lending programs , particularly the program to help small businesses , have really helped lots of businesses . Over 630,000 loans have been issued , and this is really helping those The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We go back to Mr. Cumming . Mr. James Cumming : Unfortunately , lots is not an answer for the businesses that I 'm trying to talk to . Can you tell me , for the CEBA changes that were recently announced , when will we be able to see people who have income through a dividend able to apply ? Hon. Mary Ng : That 's a very important question , Mr . Chair . There 's nothing more important to me and to our government than getting these supports out to businesses . Those small businesses that will meet the expanded CEBA criteria are working very diligently with the financial institutions to make sure that they can get access to those loans as quickly as possible . Mr. James Cumming : Can the minister give me a day when that will happen ? Hon. Mary Ng : The financial institutions are working very hard to make sure that they can make this available to businesses . Mr. James Cumming : When will a sole proprietor be able to go for those loans ? Hon. Mary Ng : We will work very hard and very diligently to make sure that these businesses and those sole proprietors are supported . Mr. James Cumming : Could they go on Monday ? Hon. Mary Ng : There is nothing more important than making sure these businesses weather the difficult time of COVID-19 , and our measures are The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll go back to Mr. Cumming . Mr. James Cumming : How about Tuesday ? Hon. Mary Ng : I think we will all agree that getting support to these businesses is absolutely crucial . Our commitment is always going to be to get support to these businesses . Mr. James Cumming : I ca n't get a distinct answer on any of those questions . Can you tell me how much headroom is left on the CEBA program ? Hon. Mary Ng : Today , over 630,000 businesses have received the support to do things like pay for salaries , the 25 % top-up for the wage subsidy , pay for rent and pay for insurance and utilities . This is what these loans are helping our small Mr. James Cumming : How many dollars are left in the program so businesses can have some certainty that the program will be available for some time ? Hon. Mary Ng : I think you will see that the businesses across the country that I have talked to really appreciate that the government has stepped up to help them during this difficult time . These include women with businesses , indigenous-owned businesses and those small businesses all across our communities , all across the country , that are getting the necessary help . We are going to keep The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll go back to Mr. Cumming . Mr. James Cumming : How many dollars ? It ca n't be that complicated . How many dollars ? Hon. Mary Ng : There are 630,000 businesses that are getting help , and thousands more businesses will be getting help with the expanded criteria . We 're going to keep doing the work that we need to help our businesses across this country through this difficult time . Mr. James Cumming : I heard from a constituent in my riding that they waited for over four hours on the portal for CECRA . Is there an issue with the portal , and if so , when will it be fixed ? Hon. Mary Ng : Making sure that businesses get the help for commercial rent support is absolutely crucial right now . We are going to endeavour to make sure that this help gets out to those small businesses . Applications have opened in a staggered way and The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : You have time for one last short question , Mr. Cumming . Mr. James Cumming : Finally , the Prime Minister yesterday said that a list of all organizations that have been receiving CEWS will be made public . When will that be done ? Hon. Mary Ng : We have committed to making sure that those companies taking the wage subsidy program will be listed publicly . We have committed to doing that and we will do so . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We now go to Mr. d'Entremont from West Nova . Mr. d'Entremont , go ahead . Mr. Chris d'Entremont (West Nova, CPC) : Thank you very much , Mr . Chair . I have a question for the Minister of Fisheries , but I thought I would say this first . The Canadian Coast Guard is doing a search at this moment following the loss of a vessel off the coast of Newfoundland . From my community , which is a seafaring , fishing community , I just want to put my thoughts out there to the folks of Newfoundland . We are definitely thinking of them during this difficult time . My first question revolves around the lobster fishery . It 's been open in Cape Breton since May 15 , I believe . The weather has been good . The harvesters have been going at it every day . The price has dropped to $ 4.25 already . Unstable markets will probably cause it to drop even more . What is the minister doing to make sure the lobster industry survives ? Hon. Bernadette Jordan (Minister of Fisheries, Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . I want to thank my colleague for his comments with regard to the tragic accident off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador , where we saw the loss of life in a fishing accident . Of course , as coastal people , we are all in solidarity with the people of Newfoundland right now . We know that the fish and seafood sector has taken extreme hits because of COVID-19 . We 're working diligently to make sure we support the industry as best we can . We have made available over half a billion dollars to processors and harvesters to make sure they can weather this storm . We have made sure that the harvesters are able to access the harvester benefit as well as the grant , recognizing the unique nature of their business and how they are not able to access some of our other programs . We are continuing to monitor what is happening in the industry . We will continue to make sure we do everything we can to support the fish and seafood sector . Mr. Chris d'Entremont : Mr . Chair , to continue along this vein for a moment , we are still looking at unstable markets for a longer period of time . At this point , processors are being selective in what they 're buying . They 're not buying culls and other kinds of lobsters . The plants are filling up , and harvesters are worried that they might stop buying product before the season is complete . What can the fishermen expect , or what kinds of programs can they expect , if the season goes bust ? Hon. Bernadette Jordan : Mr . Chair , we know that this is a very challenging season for our harvesters . We also know that because of the decline in markets , we 've had to make accommodations for the processing sector in order to help them be better able to support the harvesters . We have put in $ 62.5 million , which is allowing the processors to increase capacity in their refrigeration and freezers so that they will continue to be able to purchase product . As I said earlier , we will continue to monitor the situation and make sure we do everything possible to support our harvesters . This is a very difficult The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll go back to Mr. d'Entremont . Mr. Chris d'Entremont : Mr . Chair , I do n't know whether this next question will go to the Minister of DFO or the Minister of Transport . Oakley Ryerson is a resident of West Nova . He is planning a career on the sea and wants to get his master class four . The problem is that he ca n't pass the eye exam . He needs full-colour vision . For those who are far-sighted or nearsighted , you just have to put on your glasses to correct it . You can actually fly airplanes . I do n't know about space shuttles , but who knows ? You can now wear colour-corrected lenses , but Transport Canada still does not recognize these for use . Can the Minister of Transport help Ryerson in attaining his chosen profession ? Hon. Marc Garneau (Minister of Transport) : Mr . Chair , I appreciate the concern of my colleague for one of the residents in his riding . I would ask him to write to me and lay out the situation . We have medical standards with respect to a number of different kinds of transportation-related jobs for pilots , mariners and those kinds of occupations , which have to be respected . However , if he sends me the details , I will look into it personally . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Mr. d'Entremont , you have another 20 to 25 seconds left . Mr. Chris d'Entremont : Mr.Chair , the eligibility criteria for financial support include the need to demonstrate a significant loss of income during the months of March and April , yet several SMEs in the tourism industry ca n't qualify because their operations start with the tourist season , in late May or early June . What will the government do to help them ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , before accessing the emergency wage subsidy , applicants must meet important criteria . However , as we explained last week , we will be adjusting the wage subsidy until the end of August , and we will be reviewing the criteria . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 're going to go to the west coast and the member for SaanichGulf Islands . Ms. May , go ahead . Ms. Elizabeth May : Thank you , Mr . Chair . My question is with regard to the urgent problem of mental health crises across Canada . My colleague , Jenica Atwin from Fredericton , held a press conference this morning in which she used the term echo pandemic . We will face an echo pandemic . We 're already seeing increases in suicides on southern Vancouver Island . My question to the minister is this : Will we see direct funding to community mental health services as urgently requested by the Canadian Mental Health Association ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , I read the honourable member 's colleague 's letter just today , and I want to reassure all members that we have invested in mental health supports for Canadians , obviously before the pandemic hit but certainly since we 've been living with the pandemic . I 'd like to remind all members to direct their constituents to the wellnesstogether.ca website and portal . There Canadians can find online resources , as well as connections to real and alive counsellors and other professionals who can help them with their various concerns . Ms. Elizabeth May : This question relates to another current emergency : the climate emergency . This week it was reported that the concentration of greenhouse gases reached 417 parts per million . That 's not just unprecedented over thousands of years ; that 's unprecedented over the last one million years . The temperatures in the Arctic broke 86F , 30C in the Arctic circle . The recognized parties in the House have established standing committees to work , but not the committee on the environment . We 've asked for this in negotiations . When will the recognized parties remember the June 2019 emergency resolution that we are in a climate emergency , and start making sure that we hit 2020 commitments under the Paris Agreement to improve our targets ? Hon. Marc Garneau : Mr . Chair , I appreciate my colleague 's questions . I will remind her that we have committed to net-zero emissions by 2050 . We 've also committed to surpassing the targets that we had originally set for 2030 . We realize that along with the COVID pandemic , which is the major problem that exists in the world today , there is another problem as well that affects the entire planet , and that is the problem associated with climate change . We remain committed to achieving those targets . Ms. Elizabeth May : My next question will be for Minister Blair , but as an aside , I will say that last answer completely fails to meet the legal requirements of the Paris Agreement to file a new target this year . To save some time , Minister Blair , let 's pretend to go back to the questions from my colleague MP Paul-Hus and to your last answer . This is dealt with on a case-by-case basis by CBSA agents . There are thousands of them . They are exercising personal , subjective judgment . This is not acceptable . I 'm begging the minister . Could the minister please put out a directive , advice to every CBSA agent on the ground , that when a non-status entry point sees a non-status direct relativehusband , wife , child of a Canadian citizenthat relative be deemed to be entering Canada for an essential purpose ? Hon. Bill Blair : I 'd like to thank the member for bringing this issue forward again . It 's an important one . We have been working very hard to ensure that we do everything possible to keep families together . At the same time , we 've been working with the provinces and territories , listening to the concerns of Canadians about ensuring that travel across our international border , particularly with the United States , is limited to essential travel . As I 've indicated , I 've had a number of important conversations and necessary conversations with our provincial and territorial partners . I believe there is a consensus on the right way forward on this , and we 're working very diligently to put it in place . I want to assure the member opposite that we have given very clear direction to our CBSA officers . I believe our border services officers have been doing an extraordinary job for us in the exercise of their discretion . At the same time , they have been doing the important work of ensuring the health and safety of Canadians at our border . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 're now going to Ms. Kwan for Vancouver East . Ms. Kwan , go ahead . Ms. Jenny Kwan (Vancouver East, NDP) : Four out of the five homes listed in the armed forces report were for-profit . It is painfully clear that corporate profits are being put ahead of the well-being of seniors . Will the minister admit that the for-profit model is failing our loved ones and commit to getting profits out of long-term care ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : As the member opposite notes , nobody can read that report or hear those stories without feeling absolute horror and disgust and without demanding better for the elders in our lives . As I have mentioned many times in the House , our government remains committed to working with provinces and territories to ensure that every elder person in our community can age with dignity and in safety . Ms. Jenny Kwan : Minister , if that 's the case , I will ask again . Will the minister make sure that the focus of long-term care homes is taking care of seniors and not taking care of owners ' bank accounts ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : As the member will obviously know , long-term care remains in the jurisdiction of provinces and territories , and there is legislation that rules them as such . As the member also knows , we have stood by Ontario and all of the other provinces and territories throughout this outbreak . The Prime Minister has been very clear The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We will go back to Ms. Kwan . Ms. Jenny Kwan : Is the minister refusing to answer the question because she agrees that profit should come before care ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : I think it 's unfortunate that the member is trying to place words in my mouth . What I do agree with , though , is that long-term care needs to be reformed , and I think all provinces and territories know , and all Canadians know , that we have to do a better job . Ms. Jenny Kwan : It 's simple for the minister . She can just answer the question . Is she willing to defend for-profit care for our seniors ? Is she in favour of for-profit private health care too ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : What I am willing to defend is the right for all Canadians to age with safety and dignity . Ms. Jenny Kwan : To the minister , what is the difference ? Why sell out the care of our seniors ? Will she commit that she will take profit out of long-term care ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , I think the member opposite knows that the only way to actually reform long-term care is to work with provinces and territories , in fact , all levels of government , to ensure that the people who spent their lives caring for and nurturing us can end their lives with caring and nurturing The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We will go back to Ms. Kwan . Ms. Jenny Kwan : I think the minister knows that what we need is national standards for seniors ' care . The Revera long-term care homes are owned by the Public Sector Pension Investment Board . Since the government owns these homes , has the military been sent in there to see what 's happening to seniors under their care ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , we know that it is important to work with all of the provinces and territories under whose jurisdiction it falls to protect the seniors within those care homes . That 's what we 've been doing since the beginning of the outbreak of the coronavirus , and that 's what we 'll continue to do to protect the lives of seniors and strengthen their protection . We will , as I said , Mr . Chair , work with the provinces and territories to have a longer-term plan so that all seniors can age with dignity and safety . Ms. Jenny Kwan : The government has a clear responsibility here . What is the government doing to ensure the standards of care in these Revera homes that they own ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , as I have repeatedly said , the jurisdiction for care of long-term care homes falls within the provincial and territorial realm . However , that being said , Mr . Chair , we have been there for provinces and territories since the outbreak of the coronavirus , and as the member opposite has clearly or likely heard the Prime Minister say , we will stand with provinces and territories as all elders have the right to age with dignity The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We go back to Ms. Kwan . Ms. Jenny Kwan : I did n't hear an answer , Mr . Chair , so the answer is nothing , then . Do you think that the families of the seniors in these homes want to hear those excuses about jurisdictional issues ? Does the minister not think that the families want to hear that the federal government is doing all it can to care for their parents ? The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : I would remind the members to direct their questions through the chair . The honourable minister . Hon. Patty Hajdu : Thank you , Mr . Chair . Quite frankly , I do n't think that families care which level of government is responsible for caring for their elders . I think what they care about is that their elders are cared for . That 's in fact what the Prime Minister believes . That 's in fact what our government believes , and that 's why we have willingly stepped up to say to provinces and territories that we will be there with you to make sure that all seniors in our lives have the right to age with dignity and care . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We will now give the floor to Mrs.Gill , from the riding of Manicouagan . Go ahead , Mrs.Gill . Mrs. Marilne Gill (Manicouagan, BQ) : Mr.Chair , my question is for the Prime Minister who , earlier , clearly told us that the government 's assistance is intended for those who are most in need and most vulnerable . I come from a riding where a lot of people make their living from the tourism industry . I do n't know if the PrimeMinister read the newspapers yesterday , but in Quebec , losses to the tune of $ 4billion are expected until March2021 in the tourism accommodation sector alone . The service sector will lose 93,000jobs . How can I justify to my constituents the fact that a political party , which does not need it , has already seen money from the emergency wage subsidy , when people in my riding do n't yet have access to it because of the seasonal nature of their work ? These people have n't seen the money that is available through these programs . Hon. Bill Morneau : We think it is very important to protect the country 's employees in all sectors of the economy . Through this approach , there will be more jobs after the pandemic , and the economic situation will be better . We will continue this approach . Mrs. Marilne Gill : Mr.Chair , this is the wrong approach . They are saying that they are protecting the jobs of the Liberal Party of Canada , which does not need the money . I 'll ask a question similar to the previous one . Fishers in my riding did not qualify for the emergency wage subsidy . Another program was created for them , which is n't quite the same and does n't really meet their needs . A government whose political wingnot the parliamentary wingdoes n't really need money takes money from the fund , but leaves fishers to make do with less generous programs that do n't meet their needs . What do I tell the fishers in my riding ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we know that many sectors of the economy across the country are facing challenges . That 's why we have adopted an approach with consistent criteria for all employees in all sectors . We have also introduced specific measures to help certain sectors , such as the fishing industry . We will continue our approach because we believe it 's the best way to protect employees and our economy . Mrs. Marilne Gill : Mr.Chair , I 'm still not satisfied . The government is saying that the best way to proceed is to give money to the political wing of the Liberal Party of Canada , when there are people who are getting nothing . What am I supposed to tell seasonal workers , who have absolutely no assurances for their future ? I ca n't go back to my riding and say I 'm proud of the work the government is doing or our efforts in the House . It 's true , the House is closed right now . I forgot . I have a very hard time accepting that the government is helping employees of the Liberal Party in preparation for the next election campaign , when communities in my region are dying because their economies revolve around a single industry . I ca n't tell them I 'm not ashamed of what 's going on as we speak . Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we felt it was necessary to put emergency programs in place in response to the crisis during the pandemic . That is our approach . The emergency wage subsidy is a program that is clearly meant to ensure employees are protected and maintain their relationship with their employer . As for the Canada emergency response benefit , it means a lot to people who do n't have a job . We are going to stick to our approach , which is to use consistent criteria to help all employees and all Canadians around the country struggling in any sector of the economy . Mrs. Marilne Gill : Mr.Chair , I think the honourable Minister of Finance lives in an ivory tower . No , he is not protecting all jobs . No , he is not protecting all sectors of the economy . Once again , I will say that a party that does n't need money has already received subsidies . However , people who need that money , people who are actually losing money or who do n't know if they 'll even be working this summer are getting zilch . There is absolutely no justifying that . I 'd at least like to know whether the government is ashamed of what it 's doing . When people have a conscience , eventually , they want to make up for their mistakes . Are the Liberals going to return that money ? Is the finance minister going to help all sectors of the economy , including tourism , fisheries and seasonal industries ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , I 'd like to thank the member for her question . Our approach is based on consistent criteria . The emergency wage subsidy is meant for any sector of the economy where revenues have dropped by 30 % or more . The measure is hugely important for organizations that are really struggling , because we can protect their workers . We are also providing the Canada emergency response benefit to other employees , meaning , those who have lost their income because of COVID-19 . Consequently , we will keep up our approach to ensure we continue to fare as well as possible and the economy works well after the pandemic . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Now we 'll go to our last group of interventions , and that will be from Ms. Jansen in CloverdaleLangley City . Ms. Jansen , go ahead . Mrs. Tamara Jansen (CloverdaleLangley City, CPC) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . I 'd like to begin with a shout-out to the brave waiters and waitresses at our local Earls restaurant and Browns Socialhouse , who have been opened again for on-site dining this week . Here in B.C . we 're beginning to find our new normal , and it was great to see how small businesses have so quickly adapted their establishments to keep their workers and patrons safe while allowing people to get back to the business of living . You guys rock . Thanks for taking the lead . Mr . Chair , here in my riding I recently had contact with the mayor of Langley City who was wondering if I had any way of accessing personal protective gear , because our local firefighters were running out of stock . Then again yesterday , I spoke with one of our local homeless shelters that is also looking for PPE . Dr. Tam is telling all Canadians to wear masks in public , but I 'm wondering if the Minister of Public Service and Procurement could tell us where exactly we 're going to get all those masks with the current shortage . Hon. Anita Anand : I want to be clear that our priority as a federal government has been to respond to provincial and territorial requests for PPE that goes to front-line health care workers . That is our priority , and we 've been procuring goods aggressively in domestic and international markets . We are now actively also exploring ways in which we can assist broader organizations across the country with PPE needs , and that is something that I 'll continue to update the House on as we go forward . Mrs. Tamara Jansen : A Globe and Mail article revealed that government orders for N95 masks have steadily been dropping . We 've gone from over 200 million ordered to 100 million , according to a federal source . Mr . Chair , the number of N95 masks ordered , as reported on the department 's website , does continue to fall . Will the minister tell us why we seem to continue to struggle to supply PPE to Canadians ? Hon. Anita Anand : It is no secret that we are in a global competition for N95 masks and other supplies , so the Government of Canada 's approach is to diversify supply chains internationally and build up and retool domestic industry so that we can have these supplies going forward . In terms of the numbers on our web page , we have short-term and long-term contracts in place The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We go back to Ms. Jansen . Mrs. Tamara Jansen : Yes , I understand that a number of Chinese mask manufacturers have been nationalized , and products for Canadians have been confiscated by the CCP government . Is the drop in N95 orders due to , in actual fact , contracts being cancelled ? Hon. Anita Anand : On N95 masks , I would like to assure the member and the House that we have multiple contracts in place for the procurement of N95 masks , including with 3M in the United States , whose masks are crossing our border weekly over the next month . Mrs. Tamara Jansen : That did n't quite answer my question . Have any of our orders been cancelled by the nationalization of these manufacturers in China ? Hon. Anita Anand : We have an aide in place in China . We have our embassy and other firms actively ensuring that our supplies from the manufacturing source make their way to the warehouse . Over 40 flights have come to Canada with those masks and other supplies . Our supply chains are operating despite the global environment being highly competitive . Mrs. Tamara Jansen : We know many millions of N95 masks have arrived in Canada from China and have been substandard . What is the total number of substandard masks that have arrived ? Hon. Anita Anand : Mr . Chair , as previously explained to the House , about eight million masks did not meet spec by the Public Health Agency of Canada and have been repurposed to some extent in other areas of the system . Mrs. Tamara Jansen : In a previous committee , the deputy minister advised us that Medicom was shoulder-tapped by the government to consider producing PPE . How many other companies did the government approach for this contract ? Hon. Anita Anand : We have operated in a very urgent way in order to procure supplies for front-line health care workers . We are now also moving to ensure that we have competitions run for the procurement of personal protective equipment . It 's a multi-pronged approach , and our priority is to get supplies out to front-line health care workers in this time of crisis as quickly as possible . Thank you so much . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Just before we adjourn , I think this another mark of accomplishment on behalf of the great team here at the House of Commons . There have been some great efforts , even since yesterday evening , to get this turned around for today . My compliments to all members joining us here in the House and to all members who have joined by virtual conference . The committee is now adjourned until noon tomorrow . The meeting is adjourned . 
Query : How did the Prime Minister debate about the delaying of the government 's response towards Covid-19 ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau (Prime Minister) : Mr . Chair , we knew from the beginning of this pandemic that we did need to move extremely quickly , and that 's what we did . We rolled out the Canada emergency response benefit extremely quickly . Eight million Canadians have had that as a replacement for paycheques lost because of COVID-19 . We also moved forward on the wage subsidy and a range of other programs to support workers and small businesses . What we 've done in terms of helping small businesses with the Canada emergency business account has had a massive impact on small businesses across the country , but we understand that certain companies and businesses have particularities that mean it 's a little more difficult for them to qualify . We are working with them through their regional development agencies , and we encourage them to approach their local RDAs , which will be able to help them get the money they deserve . Hon. Andrew Scheer : Mr . Chair , these are very simple technical fixes that can be made by this government . There 's no excuse for the delay . It 's May 27 . They 've known about these problems for weeks . They 're trying to get patted on the back for actions they took back in March , and yet they are letting so many Canadians down by not making these very simple changes . For example , companies that have acquired another company in the last year have employees whose jobs are threatened . The businesses are not allowed to qualify for the wage subsidy because their revenue is now counted together . We have identified this gap . Again , it 's a simple question . Will companies that have acquired another company still be allowed to use the wage subsidy to keep workers on the job , yes or no ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , I know that there are many different types of businesses across this country that need support . We have moved forward on supporting as many of them as we possibly can , and we continue to work on filling gaps . I know the member opposite has talked to me a number of times about a tractor company in his riding . I can assure you that finance officials are engaged with that company to see if there 's a way to make sure we 're getting them the support they need . Hon. Andrew Scheer : It 's actually a very simple fix . I can save him and his officials a lot of time . The government used the word amalgamation when it announced the changes to that program . He can make this very clear , and save a lot of work , just by including the word acquisition . Will he do that ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , I can assure you that finance officials are working closely with Brandt Tractor . They 're continuing to work with a range of businesses across the country that , for various reasons , are not able to apply for the help we have now . We will continue to work to make sure people who need the help get it . Hon. Andrew Scheer : Mr . Chair , it 's literally one word . We can email him the text . We can send him the page in the dictionary where that word is defined , if that would help . Another gap that is letting people down is in the rent relief program . The government has set the parameters to qualify for the rent relief program for companies that have experienced a 70 % revenue loss . There are untold thousands of businesses that have experienced a 50 % , 55 % , 60 % or 65 % loss that are ineligible but have no capacity to pay the rent . We called on the government weeks ago to have a more flexible sliding scale to allow more companies to access this program to keep more people on the job and more businesses open . Will the government introduce some flexibility to this program to help more businesses survive ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , from the beginning of this pandemic , our public servants and policy-makers have been moving creatively and quickly to try to get help to as many people as we possibly can , with our focus being on the people who need it the most . Obviously , this pandemic is affecting everyone and every business across the country in different ways , but our focus has been on ensuring that those who most need it are getting the help they can . We will , of course , continue to work with the parties opposite and all Canadians to ensure that we 're getting help to everyone who needs it , but our focus has always been on the most vulnerable , first and foremost . 
Query : What did the opposition party and the Prime Minister commented about companies laying off workers in the midst of pandemic ? The Chair : The floor now goes to Mr.Blanchet . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet (BeloeilChambly, BQ) : Thank you , Mr.Chair . My question is for the Prime Minister . If the Liberal Party of Canada had not taken advantage of the emergency programs , would it have laid off all its staff ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , we recognized that a number of organizations and companies were facing difficulties because of COVID-19 . People work for those organizations , as accountants , receptionists , assistants or labourers , and those people need to be supported . We are supporting people all over the country through that program . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Is the Liberal Party one of those organizations in difficulty ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Any company or organization that can demonstrate a significant drop in its income , whether that be in donations , receipts , profits The Chair : The floor goes to Mr.Blanchet . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty , as an organization ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , we created specific criteria to help organizations in difficulty . Any organization experiencing those difficulties can apply . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : In the Magdalen Islands , fishing companies in difficulty and in need of assistance will not have the money that the Liberals are going to take . Is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty , as an organization ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , we have invested in assistance for fishers all across the country . We recognize that it is a difficult situation because of COVID-19 . We will be here for our fishers and for industries in difficulty . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : I am not catching many answers , it seems to me . A company in Drummondville that manufactures isolation membranes is in difficulty because a federal program is inadequate . Compared to that company , is the Liberal Party of Canada in difficulty , as an organization ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , there are clear criteria for submitting applications under these programs . Companies and organizations that receive money qualify for those programs . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : If the program criteria establish that the Liberal Party is an organization in difficulty , does that mean that the criteria to determine whether an organization is in difficulty are poorly designed ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , all through this pandemic , our priority has been to be here for workers in difficulty so that they do not lose their jobs . This applies to all organizations and companies in the country to the extent possible . That is what we are in the process of doing . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Given the answers from the Prime Minister , let me ask this question : is the Prime Minister in difficulty ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : No , Mr.Chair . We are doing important work for all Canadians , every day . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Restaurant owners on rue Ontario in Montreal feel that they will not make it through the crisis and that they will never open their doors again . They are in difficulty . By comparison , is the Liberal Party of Canada an organization in difficulty that will not open its doors again after the crisis ? We can but hope . Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , we established criteria for that program in order to help those working for various organizations . Any organization that receives the subsidy has qualified for it . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Is there a consensus in the Liberal Party caucus that the Liberal Party is in difficulty as an organization ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , we are working every day to help Canadians and workers in difficulty . We are going to continue to do that work . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : Does answering a question put the Prime Minister in difficulty ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , it is a pleasure to be here in the House and to answer questions from Canadians and from members of the opposition . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : You are going to answer a question from a Quebecker , I hope . Companies are struggling in Saguenay , in the Gasp , in Beloeil . Would those companies not deserve to be saved by the money that the supposedly struggling Liberal Party has taken ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : I am always very happy to answer questions from all Canadians currently sitting in the House . We will be here to help workers in difficulty all across the country , including in Quebec . Mr. Yves-Franois Blanchet : If the Prime Minister is so happy to answer questions , I hope he will be delirious with joy to answer this one . Is the Liberal Party in difficulty ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , we established a program to help those working in organizations and who could lose their jobs because of COVID-19 . We are here to help workers in organizations and companies all over the country . 
Query : What was the debate over the situation of long-term care ? The Chair : We 'll now go on to Mr. Singh . Mr. Jagmeet Singh (Burnaby South, NDP) : Thank you very much , Mr . Chair . The conditions of seniors as outlined by the military were appalling , but seniors need more than just compassionate words . They need action . Will the Prime Minister stop hiding behind excuses and actually show leadership to fix long-term care ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , the Constitution of Canada is not an excuse . It lays out the divisions of powers and responsibilities , and we respect the provinces ' jurisdiction over long-term care facilities . However , from the very beginning , we have indicated our willingness to support the provinces on this very important issue . We need to make sure our seniors right across the country are properly cared for , which is why we sent in the military and why we are there to help the provinces . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : The former federal health minister , Dr. Philpott , said , We need to stop using jurisdiction as an excuse to not have federal leadership . That is a former federal health minister . Now , we know from the military report that staff were afraid to use vital equipment because of the cost . Will the Prime Minister call for an end to profit in long-term care ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , over the past couple of days I 've had very good conversations with the premiers of both Quebec and Ontario on this important issue . I look forward to discussing issues around long-term care with all the premiers of the provinces and territories tomorrow evening as well . This is something that Canadians have seen needs concerted action . We will be there to support the provinces . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : Needles were reused and expired medication was used , according to military reports . Will the Prime Minister call for an end to profit in the care of our seniors ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , the contents of that report were deeply disturbing and troubling for all Canadians . That is why we are committed to working with the provinces to fix this situation . Ontarians and indeed people right across the country are deeply preoccupied by what they 've seen going on . We need to fix this , and we will do that together . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : The military report found that cockroaches and flies were present and that food was rotten . Will the Prime Minister call for national standards so that long-term care is governed by the same principles as the Canada Health Act ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , our priority right now is ensuring that we are supporting the provinces in their need to make sure that all seniors are protected right across the country in all those institutions . Going forward , we absolutely will need to have more conversations about how we can ensure that every senior across the country is properly supported . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : The military report found that respecting the dignity of patients was not a priority . Will the Prime Minister call for national standards and for long-term care to be governed by the same principles as the Canada Health Act ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , all Canadians know we need to do better by our seniors . This is something we all take very seriously , and all orders of government will work together to make sure that right now , and going forward , we improve our systems . The federal government will be there to work with the provinces on making that happen . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : Mr . Chair , the Prime Minister has said that he 's willing to work with the provinces . I 'm saying that we need to see federal leadership . We need a commitment at the federal level that the Prime Minister will push for things that people need , which is to remove profit from long-term care and to establish national standards . Will the Prime Minister go beyond working with provinces and show some leadership ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr.Chair , I will always be here to stand up for Canadians in all different situations . We are going to work with the provinces , fully respecting jurisdictions , to make sure that , all across the country , Canadians in long-term care are supported as required and receive the services and the care they deserve . The Chair : Mr. Singh , we have 30 seconds . Ask a brief question , please . Mr. Jagmeet Singh : Thank you very much . The COVID-19 crisis should not be used as an excuse to avoid presenting solutions to the missing and murdered indigenous women and girls committee , in particular by delaying action on the calls for justice . This is the same government that would not recognize it as a genocide , the same government that delayed the United Nations declaration legislation and the same government that is still taking indigenous kids to court . Will this government commit to core funding for indigenous services to help women and girls and ensure that the calls for justice are implemented without delay ? Right Hon. Justin Trudeau : Mr . Chair , we continue to work very closely with partners on the calls for justice even as we act in many areas , including better funding for shelters and for victims of domestic violence . We will continue to work with those partners , but people will understand that many of those partners are very focused right now on helping front-line workers , not on establishing the report . We will continue to work with them on the report , but the COVID-19 situation has made that more difficult . The Chair : I want to thank the honourable members who are shouting time , but I do have a timer here , and I am taking care of it . I appreciate the help , but I do want to remind them that I have the proper machinery here . We will now go to Mr. Bezan . 
Query : What was the questioning about the reports on long-term care facilities ? Mr. James Bezan : Thank you , Chair . My question is to the Prime Minister . He was just talking about the tragic conditions in long-term care facilities in Ontario , and there was a report out from Quebec today . I want to commend the Canadian Armed Forces for witnessing these appalling conditions , putting it in the context of a report , and providing care to our loved ones in these long-term care facilities . The government is saying they did n't receive the report from the department until May 22 , but this report came out on May 14 . What happened to that report for eight days ? The Chair : We will go to the honourable minister . We seem to have a technical issue , Mr. Sajjan . We ca n't hear you . You might want to put down your bar and keep it down while you 're speaking . Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan (Minister of National Defence) : Mr . Chair , I want to thank our Canadian Armed Forces members for the tremendous work they are doing . They did their duty , noted down their observations and reported them . While those observations were being reported directly to the managers , a report was being compiled . This report was given to me on the 21st . I then forwarded it to the Minister of Public Safety on the 22nd , and that report was then given to the provincial authorities very quickly afterwards . Mr. James Bezan : I trust that you got the report on the 21st , but the report was written on the 14th , so what happened with that report for seven days ? Why was n't it acted upon ? Could you just explain that ? Our loved ones were at risk during that entire time . Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan : Mr . Chair , as we stated , this report was done and given up through the chain of command , and the appropriate leadership did their due diligence . Once we received this report , it was forwarded to the appropriate authorities . Again , I want to commend our Canadian Armed Forces members for not only the tremendous work they are doing but also for doing their duty . Mr. James Bezan : That report from Ontario documented appalling conditions , horrific care that was being given to the clients , and also the way that the staff conducted themselves . We know that there are 39 members of the Canadian Armed Forces currently infected with COVID-19 . Minister , do you believe that the infection could have been transmitted from staff to our soldiers serving in long-term care facilities because proper protocols were not being followed ? Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan : Mr . Chair , when it comes to any type of activities that we send our Canadian Armed Forces on , we do our due diligence to make sure that we have the right protocols in place and the appropriate training . This is why we have taken the time to make sure our folks not only did the appropriate training but had the appropriate equipment . We have the right protocols in place , and we will make sure that our members who are infected by COVID will get the appropriate treatment as well . Mr. James Bezan : Does the Minister of National Defence believe that our soldiers serving in Operation Laser , who have put themselves in harm 's way in battling the COVID virus as a war , deserve to have hazard pay benefits ? Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan : Mr . Chair , when it comes to looking after Canadian Armed Forces personnel , yes , we are actually in the process as we speak of making sure that our members have the appropriate hazard pay . This is currently being drafted , and we will have more to say on this shortly . Mr. James Bezan : I hope that means it 's a yes . I do encourage the government to provide that compensation to our soldiers and troops serving in Operation Laser . I would finally like to come back to the issue of the timeline from May 14 to May 21 , when that report was in the department for one week . Under our parliamentary system , ministers are accountable for the conduct of their departments . Will the minister take responsibility for that report sitting on someone 's desk for seven days and not being turned over to the proper authorities ? Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan : Mr . Chair , I want to make it very clear : When it comes to the observations that were made , those were immediately reported to the appropriate management of the care facilities and to the appropriate links within the province . At the same time , this report was being compiled and pushed up to the chain of command , and they did their due diligence . As I stated , it was given to us , and on the same day it was forwarded to the Minister of Public Safety , who immediately then sent it to the provincial authorities . Mr. James Bezan : Was one of those authorities that this was sent to the RCMP ? Hon. Harjit S. Sajjan : Mr . Chair , as stated , this will not only be given to the proper authorities but the appropriate steps will be taken now . The Chair : We 'll now go to Ms. Falk . Ms. Falk . 
Query : What was the debate about a particular fundraising campaign ? Mrs. Rosemarie Falk (BattlefordsLloydminster, CPC) : Thank you , Chair . Yesterday it was revealed that the Minister of Digital Government has been promoting a fundraising campaign to sue Global News for their story criticizing the Chinese Communist Party . Why is the minister using her authority to support the Communist Party of China and threatening our media and freedom of expression ? Hon. Joyce Murray (Minister of Digital Government) : Mr . Chair , we value the important work of media right across the country . Attacking the integrity of hard-working journalists is simply not acceptable . Like many members on all sides of the House .... WeChat is a social media platform used to engage and share information with The Chair : Now we 'll go back to Ms. Falk . Ms. Falk . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Is the minister aware of the efforts that the United Front carries out on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party to influence how Canadians view the People 's Republic of China ? Hon. Joyce Murray : Thank you for that question . Mr . Chair , I want to just be clear . The participation in the WeChat group , much like Facebook , is guided by posted The Chair : We 'll now go back to Ms. Falk . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Is the minister an active participant in the efforts by the Communists to muzzle a Canadian journalist and deprive Canadians of the facts about China ? Hon. Joyce Murray : Muzzling journalists is never acceptable , and our government is very clear on that . I will say that the individual in question posted something outside of the guidelines of my WeChat group and is no longer The Chair : We 'll now go back to Ms. Falk . Ms. Falk , I just want to point out that we do have interpreters listening and trying to interpret . They 'd appreciate it .... Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : My questions are short . That 's probably what it is . The Chair : Take a deep breath . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Chair , the Liberals ca n't shrug this off . The minister admitted to theBreaker that her own political staff manages this WeChat . This is someone who is paid by Canadian taxpayers . Why is the minister using tax dollars to help China attack Global News and freedom of expression ? Hon. Joyce Murray : I think the member knows very well that the people who post on WeChat are free to post what they choose within certain guidelines . Those guidelines were ignored . That person is no longer part of my WeChat group . The post was completely unacceptable , and I do not share the views of the individual . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Chair , Sam Cooper is an investigative Canadian journalist who has uncovered many different criminal rackets that can be linked back to Beijing . Has the minister apologized to Sam Cooper for attempting to shut down his work ? Hon. Joyce Murray : As we all know , community outreach is a very important part of the work of a member of Parliament . WeChat is one of many social media sites regularly used by members The Chair : We go back to Ms. Falk . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Chair , when will the minister apologize to Sam Cooper and Global News ? Hon. Joyce Murray : Mr . Chair , I have been very clear that I do not share the views of the person who posted on my WeChat site , who operated outside of my The Chair : We 'll now go back to Ms. Falk . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Chair , in December 2018 the Liberals passed Bill C-76 . This included provisions to prevent foreign interference in Canadian society . Does the government believe that Joyce Murray 's actions have violated this portion of the act ? Hon. Bill Blair (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) : Mr . Chair , I want to assure the member that we are always vigilant in any foreign interference in our national security or issues of political interference in our society . It 's monitored carefully by the national security establishment , according to the law as it exists in this country , and we will remain vigilant . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Chair , in May 2019 , the Liberals launched their digital charter . One of the principles was strong democracy , a commitment to defend freedom of expression . Will the Liberals hold Joyce Murray 's WeChat accountable if it has violated this part of the charter ? Hon. Bill Blair : Mr . Chair , we are absolutely committed to the rule of law and will always uphold it . I think , as the minister has made very clear , she was not involved in this process and has no control over the individual who posted that matter . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Chair , unfortunately I do n't believe that was a sufficient answer . This is really a yes or no . Will the government hold Joyce Murray 's WeChat accountable if it has violated their part of the charter ? Hon. Bill Blair : Again , Mr . Chair , I want to assure the member that our government remains committed to the rule of law and we will always work tirelessly to uphold the laws of this country . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Is that a yes or a no ? Hon. Bill Blair : Again , I think it was very clear . We will always uphold the laws of Canada . Mrs. Rosemarie Falk : Still , was that a yes or a no ? I 'm not hearing a yes or a no . Hon. Bill Blair : I am doing my very best , Mr . Chair , to answer the question for the House and to assure the member opposite that our government will always remain committed to the rule of law . That is unequivocal . 
Query : What policy the government was going to roll out to ease the deficit ? The Chair : We will now move on to the honourable member . The floor is yours , Mr.Deltell . Mr. Grard Deltell (Louis-Saint-Laurent, CPC) : Thank you , Mr.Chair . I am very happy and proud to be participating in this discussion in the House of Commons today . My question is very simple : how much is Canada 's deficit ? Hon. Bill Morneau (Minister of Finance) : Mr.Chair , we continue to be transparent with our measures . Of course , we want to make sure that our investments , our economy The Chair : The floor is yours , Mr.Deltell . Mr. Grard Deltell : Let me ask my question to the honourable Minister of Finance once more , since he is talking about transparency . My question is really simple : how much is Canada 's deficit ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , our economic situation is very fluid . We have made major investments and we are making sure that our economy is working . Mr. Grard Deltell : Mr.Chair , the minister 's answer is not fluid at all . But the question is really simple : how much is Canada 's deficit ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , it is important to be transparent with our investments . We look at the investments and the figures every day . Mr. Grard Deltell : Mr.Chair , the Minister of Finance may not know what the deficit is , but one great Canadian does know . And he knows that he knows . Could the Minister of Finance be very clear , very fluid and , above all , very transparent with Canadians ? What is Canada 's deficit ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , I want to be very clear with Canadians : our economic situation is very difficult . The situation is fluid . We are making investments to ensure that our economy will be strong in the future . Mr. Grard Deltell : Mr.Chair , with all due respect to the Minister of Finance , let me point out that , though he is not very clear , Canada 's Parliamentary Budget Officer was clear yesterday . The deficit is $ 260billion . That is the real number . Why does the government not have the courage to state it clearly , as the Parliamentary Budget Officer did yesterday ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we always want to be clear and transparent . It is very important for the situation to be stable in order to ensure our future . That is our economic approach . We are making investments now so that the situation becomes more stable . Mr. Grard Deltell : Mr.Chair , I know that the Minister of Finance is very good with figures . But he is not able to give us one . Perhaps he could comment on the statement that the Parliamentary Budget Officer made yesterday , that the emergency assistance must have an end date , and if it does not , we are heading to levels of taxation that have not been seen in this country for generations . What is the government going to do to make sure that Canadians will not be overtaxed after this crisis ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we think it 's very important to make investments . That way , we will have a resilient economy in the future . That 's very important . That way , we know that we 'll have a good economy in the future . When we have more information , we will The Chair : Mr.Deltell , you have the floor . Mr. Grard Deltell : Mr.Chair , will the minister commit not to raise taxes after the crisis ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , I have said several times that we do not have a plan to raise taxes . That 's very important . Mr. Grard Deltell : Finally a clear answer ! However , I 'm not convinced that he will apply it . In fact , the Parliamentary Budget Officer himself has said that there is n't much ammunition left without shifting into a large structural deficit , which can lead directly to tax increases . If the Minister of Finance ca n't even say today what the deficit is today , how can he be credible when he says that he wo n't raise taxes ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , I think what 's most important is that during this pandemic , Canadians and companies across the country need the Government of Canada 's help . That is our approach . That way , we will have an economy that will function in the future . Of course , this is important for future generations . Mr. Grard Deltell : When will there be an economic update ? Hon. Bill Morneau :  Mr. Grard Deltell : Mr.Chair , all observers are expecting an economic update to know where we 're going . When will that happen ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we want our economic update to be accurate . That 's why we are looking at information that allow us to make good forecasts . 
Query : What was the debate about the economic bilateral relations with the UK ? The Chair : We 'll now go to Mr. Hoback . Mr. Randy Hoback (Prince Albert, CPC) : Mr . Chair , the United States , Australia , India , Japan , New Zealand , South Korea and Vietnam have created an economic prosperity group to diversify some of their key supply chains away from China . Canada has a free trade agreement with six of these seven countries . Why are we not part of this group ? Hon. Mary Ng (Minister of Small Business, Export Promotion and International Trade) : Mr . Chair , I thank the hon . member for that question . Indeed , we have been working diligently with all of these countries to make sure that we are keeping global supply chains open during this critical time . I think everyone agrees that keeping supply chains open for medical goods , critical agriculture and essential goods is absolutely essential and The Chair : We 'll go back to Mr. Hoback . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , this government is refusing to come to terms with what COVID-19 will mean for the future of international trade . Why is Canada not at the table with our largest trading partner protecting the viability of our international supply chains and capitalizing on the opportunities of others doing the same ? The Chair : Before we go to the minister , one of the members has his mike still on , and I would ask that he turn it off . I am hearing background noise . The hon . minister . Hon. Mary Ng : Mr . Chair , Canada has unprecedented access to a number of markets around the world because of the extraordinary agreements that we have made to provide access to customers in those international markets . During COVID-19 , we have been working with our G20 partners . I have had two meetings with G20 trade ministers on the importance of keeping supply chains The Chair : We 'll go back to Mr. Hoback . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , is this payback for the Prime Minister snubbing these countries at the original TPP signing ? Hon. Mary Ng : Mr . Chair , we have a CPTPP arrangement with these countries , and we are looking forward to making sure that we get Canadian businesses growing into those markets . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , the U.K. will begin applying tariffs at the beginning of next year on Canadian exports such as seafood , beef and cars . These are the items that have had tariffs removed under CETA . Will the government commit to having a new trade agreement with the U.K. in place by January 1 ? Hon. Mary Ng : Mr . Chair , we are monitoring the situation very carefully . The U.K. , of course , is a very important trading partner for Canada . They are in discussions right now . I want to assure Canadian businesses that CETA continues to apply to our trade with the U.K. during this period while they go through Brexit . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , after CUSMA , this government guaranteed to the trade committee that they would publish the objectives of any new trade agreement . When will we see these objectives published and actually have a chance to view them ? 
Query : What was the discussion about imports and supply chains ? Hon. Mary Ng : Mr . Chair , we look forward to working to ensure that those objectives are published as we get into future trade discussions . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , the resignation of the WTO director-general at this unprecedented time is concerning for the international trade community . Is the government committed to supporting a DG candidate who is dedicated to the massive reforms needed to get the WTO functioning again ? Hon. Mary Ng : Mr . Chair , I want to thank the hon . member for that good question . The Ottawa group , led by Canada , is working with like-minded countries on the reform of the WTO . We 've been doing this work and we continue to do this work . I look forward to making sure that we are leading the way on those discussions with like-minded The Chair : Mr. Hoback . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , last week the President of the United States considered blocking cattle imports . Our beef producers do n't need this . They need stability . Three-quarters of Canada 's beef cattle exports go to the U.S. Has the government sought out and received assurances from the United States that no such action will apply to Canadian cattle ? Hon. Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs) : Mr . Chair , we have an excellent assurance of our trade with the United States , which is our new NAFTA trade agreement that we have negotiated , thanks to the unprecedented co-operation across this country . It is very important to the Canadian economy and Canadian producers . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , going forward post-COVID , there are a lot things that will be changing in supply chains . What is this government doing proactively to look at opportunities in these supply chains that Canadian businesses can take advantage of ? Hon. Mary Ng : Mr . Chair , we continue to work with countries around the globe to ensure that Canada 's supply chains and those global supply chains , particularly for essential goods , for agricultural products , for medical supplies , continue to remain open . We will keep doing this work . Mr. Randy Hoback : Mr . Chair , on the agriculture side , canola farmers would like to know the status of canola going into China . Can she update the House on that status ? Hon. Marie-Claude Bibeau (Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food) : Mr.Chair , I want to assure my colleague that we are continuing to work with our industry representatives , our allies and our trading partners in China . The Chair : We 'll now go to Ms. McLeod . 
Query : What was the controversy about China hoarding PPE amid the pandemic ? Mrs. Cathy McLeod (KamloopsThompsonCariboo, CPC) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . Senior Canadian bureaucrats received very credible reports in early January that China was procuring and hoarding PPE . As a member of cabinet , was the health minister aware ? Hon. Patty Hajdu (Minister of Health) : Mr . Chair , from the very beginning of the outbreak in early January we were aware of the challenges our health sector would face , and we immediately began to work with the provinces and territories to understand what the need would be and how we could best prepare . Mrs. Cathy McLeod : In April , the minister stated there were not enough supplies in the national emergency stockpile . Can she explain why she approved a donation of 16 tonnes of PPE for China on January 31 , claiming it would not compromise our supply ? She ca n't have it both ways . We do n't have enough ; we have enough and it wo n't compromise it . Hon. Anita Anand (Minister of Public Services and Procurement) : Mr . Chair , we are operating in a highly competitive global environment , and the reality is that we need to make sure we have multiple complementary supply chains operating at the same time , which we have been doing in the past weeks and months , to ensure our front-line health care workers have the supplies they need to keep Canadians safe . That 's our priority . That 's what we 're working on . Mrs. Cathy McLeod : Unfortunately , this question was directed to the health minister , referencing things she actually stated in terms of the availability of our supplies . Before the she signed off on the donationand it was the health minister who signed off on the donationdid she consult with the health ministers in the provinces and territories ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , as the member opposite knows , provinces and territories have their own stockpiles , which of course they use to prepare for incidences of outbreak and other illnesses across their jurisdictions . We 've worked very closely with the provinces and territories since the beginning of the outbreak to make sure we can provide any particular additional support . In fact , of all the requests made so far , we have been able to complete them . Mrs. Cathy McLeod : Health care workers are now having to look at modified full-face snorkels as an alternative to N95 masks . Did it not occur to the minister that our hospitals and care homes could have used that PPE she shipped out , providing a longer opportunity for them to also get procurement done ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , as the member opposite knows , the equipment that was donated when China was in its outbreak was an important donation of nearly expired or expired goods that it was in desperate need of in its effort to try to contain the virus . As the member opposite knows , we 've been able to work successfully with provinces and territories to ensure they have what they need . Mrs. Cathy McLeod : Mr . Chair , I would suggest that during February and March our hospitals would have consumed that almost-expired product very efficiently , but I want to move on to another topic . When defending the sale of 22 seniors ' homes to the Chinese government , the Prime Minister stated that we have a strong regulatory regime that imposes rigorous standards . He said that this regime ensures the care our seniors get is top quality . That was in 2017 . Now he states he is saddened , shocked , disappointed and angered . Was the Prime Minister completely oblivious to the risks , or was he just too anxious to please the Chinese government when he sold those 22 homes ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , the homes the member opposite is referring to are in the province of B.C. , and I have to commend the province for the early work it did to protect seniors in those long-term care homes . The member opposite is trying to confuse the issue . As she knows , the review we did was entirely separate from the standards to which the province holds the care homes . Mrs. Cathy McLeod : The Prime Minister does not have authority over seniors ' homes , which he has clearly stated , but he does have authority over the act in which he approved the sale . At 18 months , government had an obligation to make sure there was compliance . Was that done ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , the long-term care homes in each province fall within the jurisdiction of their own particular act , and those provinces and territories are responsible for fulfilling the inspections required under that act . Mrs. Cathy McLeod : Under the Investment Canada Act , the government is obligated to review the sale for compliance . Four homes had to close . Since the government approved the sale , it is complicit in the care of our seniors in this country Hon. Navdeep Bains (Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry) : Mr . Chair , I want to make it very clear that we understand how difficult this is for seniors . That is why we follow the appropriate steps , outlined under the Investment Canada Act , to make sure that any measures we take keep seniors and their well-being first and foremost . 
Query : What was the debate about government giving money to companies which did not put the amount into proper use ? The Chair : Mr.Therrien , you now have the floor . Mr. Alain Therrien (La Prairie, BQ) : Mr.Chair , during the pandemic , the government has given money to companies that do n't pay a cent in tax because they use tax havens . We told the government that it did n't make sense . The government 's response was that it is no big deal . During the pandemic , the government gave money to Air Canada , but Air Canada never reimbursed customers who did not get the services they paid for . We told the government that it did not make sense . The government 's response was that it was no big deal . During the pandemic , the Liberal Party used the emergency wage subsidy to fund partisan activities . We told them that it did not make sense . The government responded that it was no big deal . Is the moral of the story that the government thinks that dipping into the pockets of taxpayers to spend money carelessly is no big deal ? Hon. Diane Lebouthillier (Minister of National Revenue) : Mr.Chair , the fight against tax evasion is a priority for our government . We will continue to target companies that use tax evasion schemes . Let me be clear : in everything we do , we will target companies and not innocent workers . Employees are employees , no matter who they work for . Mr. Alain Therrien : Mr.Chair , when I see that it 's the Minister of National Revenue answering me , I do n't feel like buying a lottery ticket . The Liberal Party used two airplanes in its last election campaign , which seems to indicate that it is n't short of money . However , the Liberals used the emergency wage subsidy . Why ? Is it because they want taxpayers to fund a third airplane ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we think it 's very important to protect employees across the country and in every economic sector that 's experiencing a significant drop in income . That 's the approach we 've taken to protect people and to ensure that there will be jobs in the future . We will continue this approach . Mr. Alain Therrien : It 's especially important to protect the employees who work for the Liberals to ensure their re-election , yet the Liberal Party has raised more than $ 7million since the last election . Is the party in jeopardy ? Can it go bankrupt ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , as I said , our approach is to protect employees . We think that this principle is very important and that this approach must be maintained in order to have a better job market in the future . Mr. Alain Therrien : Mr.Chair , we still do n't know exactly how much money the Liberals took from the cookie jar . We think they may have taken as much as $ 1million . How many SMEs could have been saved with the $ 1million that the Liberals took out of the jar and took away from SMEs ? Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we appreciate the question . We are protecting hundreds of thousands of SMEs through the emergency wage subsidy , the Canada emergency response benefit and all our programs . We will continue this approach to help SMEs and their employees . Mr. Alain Therrien : Mr.Chair , I will propose a choice of answers , or I wo n't get any . When did the government decide to use the emergency wage subsidy ? Now here are three possible answers . The first possible answer is that when the Liberals brought in the emergency wage subsidy , they set parameters allowing them to use it . The second is that when the Liberals saw the Conservative Partywhich is as rich as they are , but also sanctimonious and self-righteoustake advantage of the subsidy , they thought they could do it too . The third possible answer is that the Liberals had n't planned to use the subsidy , but they pounced on the cookie jar when they saw it , because that 's what they do . Hon. Bill Morneau : Mr.Chair , we continue to think it is very important to protect employees in every sector of the economy and across Canada . That 's our approach , and I believe it 's the right one to protect and preserve jobs across the country during a pandemic . The Chair : We are now going to suspend the proceedings for a few seconds to allow the employees who provide support for the meeting to replace each other safely . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton (Simcoe North, CPC)) : We will now resume the discussion . We 'll continue with Ms. Khalid , the honourable member for MississaugaErin Mills . 
Query : What was the discussion about the government 's policy to improve long-term care facilities and protect the seniors ? Ms. Iqra Khalid (MississaugaErin Mills, Lib.) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . I 'll be splitting my time with the member for PickeringUxbridge . Mr . Chair , when the women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces stepped in to provide support to five long-term care homes in Ontario at the request of the premier , they released a report that outlined their findings in detail . Military members witnessed residents ' cries for help going unanswered . They saw force-feeding . They saw bug infestations , a lack of personal protective equipment and neglect . Canadians are shaken . They are appalled by the horrific conditions outlined in the military report . Almost 1,000 seniors so far have lost their lives in long-term care homes in Ontario alone , over 25 of them in my riding of MississaugaErin Mills . These deaths could have been prevented . Can the Minister of Health please update the House on how our federal government is working with the provinces and territories to prevent further tragic occurrences from happening at long-term care homes and to ensure that our most vulnerable seniors are properly looked after and cared for ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , it 's such an important question . I believe all Canadians were deeply horrified to read the details from the Canadian Armed Forces on the conditions in long-term care homes in Ontario . What 's happening to seniors in Ontario is completely unacceptable . The report is very troubling . Seniors deserve to live with dignity , with respect and with safety . While long-term care is provincially regulated , we know that we need to work together . The Government of Canada stands ready to support provinces and territories as they continue to respond to this crisis . I had a very good conversation with my provincial and territorial counterparts last night about the work we can do at a national level to support their important work . We also know that seniors want to stay at home longer . That 's why our historic investment of $ 6 billion in home care was so important . We 'll continue to work with the provinces and territories to ensure that they get the care and dignity they deserve . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll go now to Ms. O'Connell . Ms. Jennifer O'Connell (PickeringUxbridge, Lib.) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . I will sadly report that my community of Pickering has experienced the largest number of deaths at a single COVID-19 outbreak location anywhere in this country . Seventy residents at Orchard Villa long-term care home died during this pandemic . It was a devastating blow to our community . Yesterday , we received the horrific report from the Canadian Armed Forces detailing what they witnessed at Orchard Villa in Pickering , Altamont Care Community in Scarborough , Eatonville Care Centre in Etobicoke , Hawthorne Place in North York , and Holland Christian Homes ' Grace Manor in Brampton . The loved ones of those who have passed away , as well as the homes ' workers , have asked for a full public inquiry from the Ontario government . I know that the responsibility for these facilities falls within provincial jurisdiction , but on behalf of our communities , can the Minister of Health update us on the work she is doing to ensure that the Ontario government takes action immediately and initiates a full , independent , non-partisan public inquiry and reverses its decision to create a government-led commission that wo n't even start until September ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , I would say that all Canadians were shocked and horrified to hear about the conditions that existed in these particular care homes . We 're so grateful to the members of the armed forces who not only improved conditions but also reported them quickly and appropriately to ensure amelioration of those conditions for those particular individuals . We also know that there are seniors all across the country who are struggling with care and with the appropriate level of care . We have to do better as a country . These are our loved ones . These are our parents and our grandparents . These are the people in our lives who have given so much to us . I stand committed to working with my provincial and territorial counterparts to ensure that we do better as a society . We know that there 's a role we can play at the federal level with advice , with guidance , with support and , yes , with investments . We look forward to having those conversations about how best we can improve the care for all seniors amongst us . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll go now to Mr. Davies from Vancouver Kingsway .

We look forward to having those conversations about how best we can improve the care for all seniors amongst us . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : We 'll go now to Mr. Davies from Vancouver Kingsway . Mr. Don Davies (Vancouver Kingsway, NDP) : Thank you , Mr . Chair . Canadians were horrified to hear the report yesterday from our armed forces about the appalling conditions experienced by seniors in our long-term care homes . Page after page detailed the filth , neglect , abuse and danger our seniors in care are exposed to on a daily basis . Shockingly they face injury and death through missed medications , expired medications , unsterile devices and violations of basic contagion rules to stop the spread of COVID-19 . Given that evidence of possible criminal conduct was contained in the military 's report , will the minister refer this matter to the RCMP for investigation immediately ? Hon. Bill Blair : Mr . Chair , thanks very much to the member for those expressions of concern , which we share . We understand in long-term care facilities both seniors and persons living with a disability face unique challenges , and the findings of this report are in fact deeply concerning and completely unacceptable . Considering the severity of this report , we promptly shared it with the Province of Ontario , and the Province of Ontario has initiated an investigation based on the report 's findings . Their investigation includes alerting the province 's chief coroner who has the authority to alert the police of jurisdiction . We will continue to work with the province to protect those living in long-term care facilities , and we continue to support them through the deployment of our outstanding Canadian Armed Forces and in our partnership with the Red Cross . Mr. Don Davies : Mr . Chair , that 's a shocking answer considering there 's clear evidence of criminal conduct and negligence in this . That this federal government is not taking immediate steps to refer this to the nation 's RCMP is unacceptable . The seniors care crisis is a national problem . COVID-19 has exposed critical vulnerabilities across Canada 's entire network of long-term care facilities . Not a single province or territory currently meets the benchmark of 4.1 hours of hands-on care per day . As a result Canada has the worst record of COVID-19 deaths in long-term care among 14 comparable countries , with over 80 % of Canadian fatalities occurring in these facilities . Will this government move swiftly to establish binding national standards for long-term care ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , the member opposite is exactly correct when he says that those who are hardest hit in terms of losing their lives and the negative effects of COVID are those who are living in long-term care homes . He 's also correct when he indicates that COVID-19 has shown us what many of us have known for a long time , that we need to do better in long-term care and supports for seniors . As the member knows , we started those steps some four years ago or so when we began to make incredible investments in aging at home . We know that is one part of the solution , but we have to do better for those seniors who need a higher level of care . That 's the work I 'm doing now . I 'm working with my colleagues at the provinces and territories to make sure that we come up with a solution that will truly result in better standards for all . Mr. Don Davies : Mr . Chair , what we need is binding national standards , just like we set through the Canada Health Act in the health care sector generally . Gross fecal contamination , filthy medical equipment , insect infestations , ignoring patient cries for hourswe would never tolerate these conditions in Canada 's hospitals . There 's no reason to accept them in Canada 's long-term care facilities . Will the minister move to bring long-term care facilities under the Canada Health Act , or similar legislation , with formal funds tied to acceptable standards of care for our seniors , just like we do for hospitals ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , the member shares the disgust and concern of so many Canadians across the country , not only those who have read the report but many of those who have struggled to provide care to elders in those long-term care homes , regardless of the province in which they live . We know we need to do better . We know that collectively , at all levels of government , we must do better for those people who cared for us and nurtured us all of those years . The member has my commitment that I will work with provinces and territories to find a solution forward to ensure that every person has the right to age with dignity and safety . The Acting Chair (Mr. Bruce Stanton) : Mr. Davies , you have 15 seconds for another question , a short one , and leave time for a response . Mr. Don Davies : Thank you , Mr . Chair . These failures are the product of systemic neglect often motivated by prioritizing profit over the provision of adequate care . Does the minister agree that we should not be putting profits above the health care needs of Canada 's seniors ? Hon. Patty Hajdu : Mr . Chair , I believe that , when we commit to taking care of people , we must do so with the utmost care that is required . I know that provinces and territories have a lot of work to do . So do we , at the federal level , and obviously at the local level . We must all work together to protect those people in our lives who are most vulnerable , whether they be seniors , children or others .
