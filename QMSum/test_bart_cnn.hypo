The meeting was mainly about the progress of the transcription project . The team was discussing how to get people to edit bleeps from the recording , and how to finish up the corpus . The team also discussed the possibility of audio monitoring , which would allow them to detect spikes in the recording . The team also discussed the possibility of adding a meta-goal to the project , which was to see if the recording was a professional recording .
Grad C suggested that they should get another wireless setup , which was expensive , but it did seem to be better than the wired . The team could replace the wired mikes with wireless . They currently had one base station with six wireless mikes , possibility of six wireless receivers , and apparently you could chain those together . The cost of the base station was nine hundred dollars for the base station , and eight hundred per channel .
The team was concerned about the quality of the recordings and the battery life of the microphones . They were using three wired microphones , but one of the wired was not working with a wireless . The professor thought that the quality of the microphones was good and that they should keep the team conscious of the batteries .
The transcriptions are currently at about eleven hours , and the transcribers are working on finishing up the first phase of transcribing . The next step is to insure that the data are clean first , and then channelized . The transcriptions are spell-checked and the mark-up is consistent all the way throughout . The team is incorporating additional conventions that Liz requested in terms of having a systematic handling of numbers , acronyms , and acronyms which they had n't been specific about .

The Children , Young People and Education Committee was meeting to discuss the issue of exclusions from school in Wales . The meeting was mainly about the issue of the number of exclusions from school , which had increased fourfold over the last five to six years . The committee members asked the witnesses to give their opinions on the issue . Nick Williams firstly , he explained that the main reason was the prevalence of ASD and the difficulty of getting the learners the right provision . Then , Sharon Davies said that the school accountability measures had had an impact on the rise in exclusions . Then , David Hopkins said that the school accountability measures were working and the school had been working hard on improving the curriculum and working with schools to ensure that the curriculum was balanced and every learner was balanced .
The meeting discussed the funding issues and the challenges of funding that face schools in general . Sharon Davies said that with the new Act coming into force , that 's going to place more pressure on the system . Nick Williams said that the Government did n't think about the staff in the pupil referral units , because they had gone back to the Government to tell them , 'Right , you 've provided money to school staff , but what about staff that need training .
David Hopkins thought that the delegation levels were already very high in most authority areas , and they had got agreements in place with the Government to make sure that more money , or as much money as possible , was devolved to schools . He also thought that the ALN legislation would put pressures on , not just local authorities and schools , but also on the post-16 sector , because they were talking now about a wider age range—doing up to 25 as well .
David Hopkins thought that the delegation levels were already very high in most authority areas , and they had got agreements in place with the Government to make sure that more money , or as much money as possible , was devolved to schools . He also thought that the factors that really affected exclusions were the narrow measure at the end of key stage 4 attainment , which he thought had put pressure on some schools , certainly , and headteachers had felt that—sometimes excluded , or otherwise put into another school as a consequence , which was regrettable , but that 's what had happened .
Nick Williams said that one of the things that had improved a lot was the networking within the PRU sector . There was definitely a better sharing of practice . The team-around-the-family approach was also discussed , which was looking at the whole package of support , that surrounds not just the learner but the family , whether it 's transport or whether it 's transport . Sharon Davies added that it was hard at key stage 4 , and it did get more difficult at key stage 4 , and it was working , then , with the team-around-the-family approach . David Hopkins said that at least one authority was looking at how they could best retain all pupils in the school setting , but it was early for looking at that yet .
Nick Williams said that the more challenging learners were the ones who were coming to the end of their statutory education , the key stage 4 . It was far , far more difficult when they were 15 , 16 to get them back into mainstream . So , then they were looking more at how they transit , then , into further education and colleges and so on . Sharon Davies agreed that it did get more difficult at key stage 4 , and it was working , then , with the team-around-the-family approach .
Sharon Davies said that it did get more difficult at key stage 4 , and it came back to that team-around-the-family approach , to ensure what was needed for that learner to go back into school , what can the school provide . It was looking at the whole package of support , then , that surrounds not just the learner but the family , whether it 's transport , whether it 's transport , it 's looking at the whole agenda , then , to ensure that everything is in place for that learner to go back to school , where it 's possible .
Nick Williams firstly explained that the reason for the delays was that there were not enough spaces in some cases , some year groups and so on . He also explained that they were struggling sometimes for additional provision , which was very important around safeguarding . However , they did n't want to make it too difficult , so that they had n't got any providers coming forward either . To actually offer some additional training was a challenge .
Janet Finch-Saunders thought that local authorities should take a greater role in quality assuring individual tuition . Sharon Davies thought that the difficulty with home tuition was that as a local authority , they were restricted on how much access they could get into the home . Therefore , it was really difficult to quality assure , because unless the families invited them in there was very little access .
Nick Williams explained that the home-tuition staff work for the local authority , and they do not use agency staff to provide a few hours of provision , for instance , to go in and provide a few hours of provision , or to go to the local library . For whatever reason their needs at the moment ca n't be met in a school or in approved provision , then the staff who do provide some education , or if it 's for medical reasons , they work for the local authority . So , they 're not using agency staff . Janet Finch-Saunders AM asked if this was widespread around Wales . Nick Williams did not know the answer to that . Sharon Davies said that they were very similar to that . David Hopkins thought that there had been a general pattern , and if you were making a provision , and if you were making a provision , you would quality assure it , clearly .
The meeting discussed the curriculum as it stands and the possibility of transferring to a new curriculum . David Hopkins first introduced the challenges of the different types of education , such as EOTAS and PRUs , and the difference between the two . Sian Gwenllian then asked about the curriculum as it stands and the challenges associated with it . David Hopkins answered that the PRUs were following a set curriculum , and the balance was there . However , the problem was that the quality assurance was not always there . Nick Williams then answered that the PRUs were working together now in terms of the new curriculum , and using the opportunity that existed now to collaborate with school staff as well . Sharon Davies then suggested that the PRUs and the schools should collaborate and have joint working to ensure that the learners had what they needed .
Sharon Davies thought that the capacity for professional training was limited , but it was getting better . There were networks now , there were conferences , but it was still limited . Nick Williams thought that it was a capacity issue , because if they took them out of the provision , it would be difficult for perhaps a supply teacher to come in and manage that class because of the demands .
Nick Williams thought that there was provision for those types of learners in the north and south of the county , but they were still talking about the PRU provision in the north and south of the county . However , the distances that those learners were having to travel were huge . David Hopkins was not aware of issues , if he was honest , but then again , it may be something they had not investigated .
The meeting started with introductions and the group got acquainted with each other . Project Manager introduced the project aim and the team 's target . The team was supposed to produce a remote control that was original , trendy and user-friendly . Then the team drew their favourite animals and discussed the characteristics of each of them . Project Manager suggested that the team should consider functional aspects and conceptual design of the remote control . The team agreed to do some tool training and discuss the project plan .
The group discussed the characteristics of animals and drew their favourite animals on the white board to sum up the characteristics of that animal . Project Manager drew a dolphin because it was smart , cute and graceful . User Interface drew a cat because it was easy to sleep and easy to use . Industrial Designer drew a cat because it was sleek and had a tail . Marketing drew a dog because it was friendly and easy to find . Marketing drew a cat because it was cute and easy to find . User Interface drew a dog because it was friendly and easy to find . Industrial Designer drew a cat because it was cute and easy to find . Marketing drew a dog because it was friendly and easy to find . Project Manager drew a dolphin because it was cute and graceful . User Interface drew a dolphin because it had a fin on top and was graceful . Marketing drew a cat because it was cute and graceful .
User Interface suggested that the call button should be easy to find and could be made of a light or a vibrating thing . Project Manager agreed that it would be a good idea to have a call button on the TV because people always know where the TV is and it would be easy to find . Project Manager also suggested that the remote control could be put on the TV and a magnet could be put on the back of it to make it easier to find .
Marketing suggested that the remote control should be bigger to not lose , but Project Manager thought it should be hand-sized . Industrial Designer thought it should be a light thing , like a spaceship , or a mobile so it could run around and come come find you . User Interface thought it would be hard to put some kind of a noise on it .
User Interface thought that the remote control should not have too many buttons because he hated when they had too many buttons and the B and F buttons did n't do anything . Project Manager agreed and suggested that the remote control could be made with a screen on it and the programming function could be added . Marketing thought that the screen would be expensive but Project Manager disagreed and suggested that the cost of the screen could be decided later .
Project Manager suggested having a clip on the remote control because Marketing had mentioned that the remote control should be robust and water resistant . Marketing thought that maybe something didn't make the hands sweat a lot .
The selling price goal was twenty-five Euro and the profit aim was fifty million Euro . Marketing suggested that they should sell two to two million units and Industrial Designer suggested two to four million . Marketing thought that if the profit for each of the units was twelve fifty , that would do four million .
The meeting started with the User Interface and Industrial Designer discussing the design of the remote control . User Interface suggested that the remote control should be made with a scroll bar and the voice recognition function was important because novice users would need to learn the functions of the voice recognition function . Industrial Designer agreed and suggested that the remote control should be made in rubber and the buttons could be made in plastic or rubber . Marketing then proposed that the remote control should be made in yellow with yellow colouring and the colouring could be yellow with grey or black . Project Manager agreed and the team agreed that the prototype should be made in yellow and the colour could be yellow . Then the team discussed the evaluation criteria of the prototype and the team agreed that the prototype should be made in a fancy look and feel and the team agreed that the remote control should be made in a fashion-forward way .
The group agreed that the remote control should be fancy , spongy , with a fancy look and feel , and should be made of yellow rubber . The group also agreed that the colour of the remote control should be yellow and the material should be soft and trendy .
Marketing thought the most important function was easy to use , which was zapping , channel switching , volume . But the more advanced functions were probably a bit harder . User Interface thought voice recognition was hard to learn , which was not for the elderly . Industrial Designer thought it was easy to use for both types of users .
The group thought the remote control was competitive in the discussion of evaluation criteria of the remote control . Project Manager thought it offered enough features , Industrial Designer thought it was quite advanced and advanced . User Interface thought it was quite simple to get used to and easy to use . Marketing thought it was quite good for this kind of market , but not for this kind of price .
The group discussed the production costs of the product and agreed that the cost was too high . Project Manager suggested that the group could skip the solar cell and push-buttons , which were the most expensive , but did add extra cost . Industrial Designer thought that the casing should be changed because there was very little added value in an enhanced case with these dull functions . Project Manager agreed and suggested that they should focus on another market segment .
The group agreed that the production costs were too high , and that the solar cell was too expensive . Project Manager suggested that the group could reduce the cost by leaving out the solar cells and not using the voice recognition feature . However , Industrial Designer thought that the group should focus on another market segment and focus on the basic remote control .
Industrial Designer proposed that the price of the remote control was fifty Euros . User Interface thought that it was quite expensive , but Industrial Designer insisted that it was not very expensive for a remote control that had this functionality . An original remote control of any T-V kind , a Phillips remote control , which cost fifty Euros , was more than fifty Euros . Project Manager agreed that it was expensive , but Industrial Designer insisted that it was worth the price because it was easier to use and it offered voice recognition .
The meeting was mainly about conceptual design of the remote control . Project Manager introduced the group to the market trends and the market research results . Marketing presented the market research results and the group discussed the material and design of the remote control . Project Manager then introduced the market research results and the group discussed the design of the remote control . The team decided on a flip design and a different shape and decided on the remote control to be a shell . The team also discussed the material of the remote control and the design of the user interface .
The team decided on a flip design , a shell shape , rechargeable batteries , a port and an alarm for getting it lost , and incorporated the image of the company into the remote control somehow . They also decided that fancy look and feel was the most important , followed by technologically innovative and easy to use .
The team decided to leave out the voice recognition and the flip design and a different shape from what 's normal . They were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what 's normal . They were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and an alarm for getting it lost .
The marketing department decided that the most important aspect was fancy look and feel , which was twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which was in turn twice as important as being easy to use . The fashion update was based on the research results from the consultants in Paris and Milan who attended all the design and fashion fairs there , which indicated that fruit and vegetables were going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . There was also a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , which was in contrast to last year .
Industrial Designer firstly , the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five was used in pretty much every remote control 's because it sends out standard signals based on your input and is pretty much used for all all T-V remotes at the moment . Second , the silicone P_C_B_ board which was used in most current remotes was a printed circuit board with contacts that were really close together and when you press down on the rubber button , it would connect the circuit and each each switch was connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it 's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of on and off bursts .
Industrial Designer suggested that the kinetic battery , which was like the kinetic battery in wrist watches , would last for a long time . The standard triple A and double A batteries were too bulky and dynamo charging was too silly . Project Manager thought that the solar charging was the best because most people had the light on in the room anyway so they could get TV when they got it .
Industrial Designer first proposed to use plastic as the main case housing , but the team thought that it would be impractical because it would be too expensive to process and too expensive to buy a new case for it . Then Marketing suggested to make the basic mould out of plastic but have a rubber cover that went over , which would give the spongy feel and allow the user to change the cover . Industrial Designer agreed and suggested that the fascia that came off the plastic would be the rubber , which was a good idea .
Industrial Designer first proposed to use a bare P-C-B circuit board with a touch screen on it , which was a thin and thin screen that did n't take up much space . Then Industrial Designer suggested to use an LCD screen on the LCD screen , which was flat and could be arranged in a sort of array and could be used as a touch . However , the problem with it was that it was flat and so it could n't do lots of curve things with it . Industrial Designer then suggested to use rubber buttons which were made of this material which was anti-R-S-I .
Marketing suggested that the team could have a stylus to press the touch screen on the device , but Industrial Designer thought that it could get easily lost and Project Manager thought that it would have to be attached . User Interface thought that a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often would find it very irritating to use a stylus and it might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .
Marketing suggested that when the remote control was opened , it would be a compact mirror that would go onto the phone display when the user pressed a button . However , the team thought that the idea would not fit in with the design of the remote control because it was aimed at men as much as women .
Industrial Designer firstly presented the findings of the study and the availability of the components in stock at the moment . The main idea of the whole thing was to design a remote control that could be found easily and that could be used to activate things on the TV . The research also revealed that the chip used in pretty much every remote control was the same one that was used in all the other remotes . Then the team discussed the battery option and decided that there was no rechargeable option available . They also discussed the solar charging and kinetic charging . The kinetic charging was the best option because it was easy to use and the team thought it would be charged through the day and then the evening .
The User Interface firstly pointed out that the standard remote was rectangular and monotonous with a very monotonous design . The second thing was that there was too much confusion and no particular remote was standard . The User Interface suggested that the remote should have a G-G graphic user interface in the middle of the flip-top and a combination of boards , which was a combination of boards and rubber buttons . The User Interface also suggested that the remote should have repetitive buttons which were like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , which meant the use of button .
Project Manager thought that the only pitfall would be how much it would cost if the speech recognition feature was adopted . Industrial Designer thought that it would be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them . Project Manager thought that they had used cheap and simple things .
The meeting was the 20th meeting of the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic . The Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness presented the 2019 annual report on the RCMP 's use of the law enforcement justification provisions . The members then presented two petitions , one of which was about the threat to pollinators globally and the other was about the southern resident killer whales . The petitioners called for more action to be taken as the population of southern resident killer whales continues to decline , more action for boat-free safety zones , more prohibitions around whale tourism to make sure that the whales were safe from those who were keen to watch them from too close a distance , and more of a credible enforcement regime to support these measures to keep the southern resident killer whale population in our waters and not on the list of species that have become extinct . The petitioners also called on the government to support a motion to support M-1 , which was placed in the House by a member for New Westminster
The members expressed their pride at the efforts of the people of Sudbury and the contribution of the local businesses and innovators in the face of COVID-19 . They also expressed their support for the people of Cape BretonCanso , which had shown a great show of community spirit during the pandemic . The members also expressed their support for the police and the government 's efforts to establish adequate funding for indigenous people .
The Prime Minister and Government were accused of tabled $ 87 billion in spending and allocated just four hours for Parliament to study , debate and pass it . A rubber stamp under the guise of health and safety was not democracy . The Prime Minister was also accused of refusing to provide an economic update , even though the Parliamentary Budget Officer was calling for it .
Sylvie Brub , a member of the Bloc , introduced that unacceptable incidents of police brutality against aboriginals had prompted Romeo Saganash to call for a commission of inquiry similar to the Viens commission in Quebec . The federal government must work with indigenous peoples , Quebec and the provinces to establish adequate funding for indigenous police forces . Civilian ethics organizations should be created to oversee the RCMP . Police officers and the general population must be better educated on indigenous realities and cultures . Hundreds of pages must be written and actions taken to restore confidence in law enforcement so as to achieve the long-overdue reconciliation .
Hon. Andrew Scheer (Leader of the Opposition ) asked if the Prime Minister would provide the Auditor General with the additional funding she needed to look into government expenditures . Right Hon. Justin Trudeau said that the government had worked with the Auditor General to increase the funding of the Auditor General 's office in 2018-19 , and the equivalent of 38 full-time staff were added . The government would continue to demonstrate openness and transparency .
The Prime Minister introduced legislation that would directly help Canadians living with disabilities , will expand the scope of the wage subsidy and will increase the flexibility of the Canada emergency response benefit . However , the opposition party was not willing to allow the debate to move forward on this bill . The opposition party was concerned that the government was not willing to help the vast majority of Canadians living with disabilities .
Hon. Carla Qualtrough assured the members that the government was aware and deeply concerned about the disproportionate impact of this pandemic on women and girls . She said that they were working hard to ensure that everyone had the supports they needed . As for the COVID-19 relief programs , the minister assured that they were taking into consideration improvements to the EI system , the wage subsidy and the future of CERB .
The meeting was about the project project to create a new remote control . Project Manager introduced the project method and the selling price of the product would be twenty-five Euros . Project Manager also announced that the product would be an international remote control and the product costs would be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . Project Manager also announced that each of the team members would have their specific roles in the project .
Project Manager introduced the project project of a new remote control . The remote control had to be original , trendy and user-friendly . Project Manager also made it clear that the product had to be an international product and the product cost should be under twelve Euros and fifty Euros . Project Manager also made it clear that the product should be simple and easy to use .
Project Manager proposed that the product should be international because they wanted to sell it in the entire world and the product costs would be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . Project Manager said that everybody would have to use it as it was the same as keyboards .
The selling price of the product would be twenty-five Euros . Project Manager thought it was a good price and not too expensive . Marketing thought it was reasonable and easy to use . Project Manager also said that the product cost should not be more than twelve Euros and fifty Euros .
The group members were divided into three groups : User Interface , Industrial Designer and Marketing Expert . Project Manager introduced the work division of the project . User Interface designed the user interface design and Industrial Designer designed the function design . Marketing was the marketing expert and Industrial Designer was the manager of the project .
Industrial Designer thought that the user interface design would design how the user would know the relation between the user and the remote control . User Interface thought that the industrial design would design how the object would look like .
The user interface designer designed the user interface design and the industrial designer designed the function design . The industrial design was the design of the object and the function design .
The meeting began with a discussion about the search for the middle layer , which was the decision-making process for the model . The team discussed the prosody of the discourse , the verbosity of the discourse , the verbosity of the discourse , and the choice of the landmark . The meeting ended with a discussion about the model 's performance on the task .
Grad B explained that the belief net was going to be a middle layer with features along the lines of where the user wanted to go and what they had said previously and what they should use . The middle layer would be hidden variables like whether the user was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry . Grad B also explained that the belief net would be in a toy version because they did n't know the probabilities of the hidden variables .
The discourse model is a discourse-based model that stores the intention of the speaker . It is the whole memory of the entire system , which is the memory of the entire system . It helps an anaphora resolution and fills in all the structures that are omitted . The discourse model also helps in the gesture screen issues and helps in coordinating the discourse model with the display .
The team discussed the intentionality of the features they had discussed in the presentation . The team discussed the prosody , the discourse , and the verb choice of the speech , and the landmark-iness of a building . The team also discussed the context of the speech , which was limited to business people , tourists , unknown time of day , and the location of the building .
The middle layer would be a set of features that would be drawn from the communication of the user . The features would include the location of where the user wanted to go and what they had said previously and what they should use . The middle thing would be the concept of whether the user was a tourist or whether they were running an errand . The hidden variables would be whether the user was on a tour , running an errand , or whether they were in a hurry .
The discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the screen . It helps an anaphora resolution and it fills in all the structures that are omitted . It also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues .
Grad A suggested that Fey would be the wizard for the data collection , meaning be the wizard for the data collection , also recruiting subjects , organizing them , and so forth . Grad B suggested that Liz would be the first subject of the trial run . Grad C thought that someone familiar enough with the data would cause problems for the wizard , so they could see if they were good .
The meeting started with a presentation from Marketing about the requirements of the marketing site and the product requirements of the group . Then , the team discussed the design of the remote control and the prototype of the remote control . The team agreed that the remote control should be a universal one and should be only for TV . Then , the team discussed the design of the remote control and the prototype of the remote control . The team agreed that the remote control should be made for the elderly and children . The team also agreed that the remote control should be made with a big screen and a simple design . The team then discussed the design of the remote control and the prototype of the remote control . The team then discussed the design of the prototype and the prototype of the remote control .
The team agreed that the remote control should be a universal one and should be only for TV . The team also agreed that it should be a remote control for kids and elderly . The team also agreed that the remote control should be bigger and bigger and have more buttons . The team also agreed that the remote control should be for the TV only and not for the phone .
Marketing thought that younger people were more interested in new features , while older people were more critical and wanted to spend more money . Marketing also thought that speech recognition was not reachable for twenty-five Euros .
User Interface thought that the company should make the product special and stand out by the looks of it . Marketing thought that the company should keep it simple and easy to use . User Interface thought that the company should make it special and stand out by the looks of it .
User Interface suggested that the basic functions should be basic numbers and on-off , volume , channels , the basic according to the user 's favourite according to the user 's choice , text service options , basic on-off , and text service options . User Interface also suggested that the user could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on the channel , but Industrial Designer thought that it would be hard to remember what favourite was what channel .
The meeting started with the presentation of individual presentations from the team members . Marketing first gave a presentation on the market situation and the findings of the market research . Then the team discussed the remote control concept and made a decision on the design of the remote control . The meeting ended with the discussion on the design of the remote control and the discussion on the price of the remote control .
The meeting was the third meeting of the project . Project Manager introduced the agenda of the meeting and the team members gave individual presentations on the remote control concept . Marketing presented on the market situation and the market trend of the remote control . User Interface presented on the market trend of the remote control and the market trend of the remote control design . Industrial Designer presented on the market trend of the remote control design and the market trend of the remote control design . Marketing presented on the market trend of the remote control and the market trend of the remote control design . Project Manager then made the decision to make the decision on the remote control design .
Marketing first introduced the findings of the research , which showed that the young target group liked fruit and vegetables in their clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they wanted spongy material . The older group still preferred dark colours and simple shapes . The feel of the material had to be spongy . Marketing also suggested that the corporate colours were grey and yellow . Industrial Designer suggested that the corporate colours were grey and yellow . Project Manager suggested that the company could make a few very colourful ones , and a very traditional co cover .
Industrial Designer thought that the feel of the material should be spongy and the material should not be too hard . Marketing thought that the older group liked familiar materials and the younger group liked soft materials . Marketing suggested that the team should use soft materials and colourful or exchangeable covers . User Interface suggested the yellow rubber cover of the Bananarama telephone from Siemens .
Industrial Designer explained that the team had three different casing possibilities , including uncurved or flat case , curved in two dimensions and curved in three dimensions . The curved one was more advanced in its shape and compared to the big grey image of the big remote control , something like that . Project Manager thought the curved design was too dull and customers would not like it . Double-curved design was not suitable because users could only use the rubber buttons and scroll-wheels .
The group discussed the user interface controls of the remote control , including the traditional solar power , push-buttons , scroll-wheels , double scroll-buttons , and scroll-bar . User Interface did not think there was any possibility for the group to use scroll-wheels , and Project Manager thought that scroll-wheels were not a good idea . Marketing thought that scroll-bar was a good idea because it might attract the young customers . Project Manager thought that the group should think about integrating a scroll-bar on the side .
The team thought that scroll-wheels were a good idea because they could be integrated with buttons and could be used like a mouse . However , they did not think that scroll-wheels could be used as a remote control with a button on it . Project Manager suggested that they could integrate a scroll-bar on the side of the remote control .
The team decided not to use LCD displays because they were not sure about the financial cost . Besides , they already had the scroll-wheels , the speaker , the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours and the fancy colours . Besides , they already had the scroll-wheels , the speaker , the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours and the fancy colours .
The meeting began with a presentation from Industrial Designer , who presented the working design of the remote control , which was a flip-open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that . Then , Marketing presented the market research results , which showed that the remote control was not that popular with customers because of the cost issue of using triple A batteries . User Interface then presented the user interface design , which was a combination of the LCD screen and a scroll wheel . Then , the group discussed the design of the remote control , which was supposed to be a universal control , one handset for all , one for TV , video equipment and a remote control for the phone . Finally , the group discussed the design of the remote control , which was supposed to be a combination of the LCD screen and a scroll wheel .
Industrial Designer first introduced the working design of the remote control , which was basically a device that sent the signal to the TV to change its state . The group discussed the battery issue and the size of the control . Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should be small and easy to carry round . Marketing thought that the triple A batteries were appropriate and the group agreed to use triple A batteries .
Industrial Designer thought that most remote controls used some form of infrared to send signals to the TV because of the cost issue of wireless and wireless was cheaper than infrared because it did not need to send much information . He thought that triple A batteries were the smallest and easiest to carry around .
Marketing presented the market research results from the usability lab and the company 's usability lab . The overall thing was that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , which had obvious design implications . Marketing also found that seventy-five percent of users found most remote controls ugly and fifty percent only used ten percent of the buttons , which was a big design issue . Thirty-four percent of people took too much time to learn to use and thirty-five percent of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury . The vast majority of the thirty-five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , which was to aid in the lost remote control when they had lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Project Manager agreed to keep it simple and only use teletext .
Industrial Designer thought that an alarm could help people find the lost remote control by whistling and a flashing light could also help people find it . However , the project manager thought that this idea was not within the budget limit and suggested that a cheaper option could be taken instead .
Industrial Designer thought that ergonomics would be different between the different designs because Japanese people have smaller hands and could n't get round the controller which was physically too big . Therefore , the company could make the remote control smaller or bigger . User Interface suggested that a touch screen could be a better option for the risk of repeated use and injuries .
Project Manager suggested that the remote control should be made in a shape that looked like a box , like a chocolate , curled up like a banana , curved like a boat , or semi-circular in the bottom , and smooth . Marketing suggested that the company logo could be incorporated into the design of the product . Marketing also suggested that the remote control could be made in a vague C-shaped shape that opened up like a shell , or something , and the team agreed to look into that idea .
The meeting was about the inquiry into the status of the Welsh baccalaureate qualification . The members of the committee were asked to give evidence on the issue . The committee members were asked to give evidence on the Welsh baccalaureate qualification and the level of professional qualifications and the quality of skills within the professional sectors . The committee members were also asked to give evidence on the Welsh baccalaureate qualification and the process of developing the skills that employers require .
Dafydd Evans thought that employers did n't have a clear understanding of what the Welsh bac means or what it includes . Dr Rachel Bowen thought that that varies by size of employer as well . While there were lots of small engaged employers who had taken an interest and did understand , the vast majority were more focused on getting on with the day-to-day running of the business . And it was quite a challenge to understand what the Welsh bac offered .
Ed Evans thought that it was fair to say employers did n't understand it , but he thought if they did , they would really appreciate this . For his sector in particular , the civil engineering sector and particularly the contracting sector depended very much on pupils who had come through from a less academic background , which gave them that ability to pursue so much of an academic focus , but to test them in terms of the challenges , but also , to the challenges . And he thought that if it was working properly and they did have employers engaged in this , and supporting schools and colleges to deliver it , they would actually be learning a lot more directly from industry . And some children , some pupils , some young people would respond far , far better to that .
Dafydd Evans thought that the voice of employers should be a key part of the review , so that employability skills and entrepreneurial skills should have more of a role within the qualification . Ed Evans agreed that they needed more employers involved in this . They thought there were opportunities to join up employers and schools and education facilities a lot more than they did at the moment . They were involved in lots of social value-type contracts in this sector , which were a perfect opportunity to tie in employers into schools and colleges and get that time and input from them into schools in a far more co-ordinated way .
Dafydd Evans thought that one of the problems was that there were a number of priorities . One of the problems was that they had a number of children coming in to the colleges , and they needed to resit their GCSEs . It was a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a C grade in the core subjects , but that ate into the time that they had to teach young people . So , the priorities , across the sector , were given priority to GCSE resits rather than doing the Welsh bac at present . At levels 1 and 2 , there were fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they were resitting their GCSEs , and there was much more use of the Welsh bac at level 3 , and A-level , and vocational level 3 . Nick Brazil thought that there was a misconception that the Welsh bac was a combination of qualifications , and it was not just one qualification but a combination . Kay
Kay Martin thought that the Welsh bac did help prepare learners for employment , but it was not for everyone . Some people doing the equivalent of three A-levels , even in a vocational programme , was too big for them . They were coming from schools with very few GCSEs or they had n't got literacy and numeracy skills , they were being tested and many of them were below level 1 in terms of literacy and numeracy . So , he thought it needs to be reviewed to look at how they could make skilled and employable people .
Dafydd Evans thought that one of the problems was that there were a number of priorities . One of the problems was that they had a number of children coming in to the colleges , and they needed to resit their GCSEs in maths , English and Welsh . It was a valid priority for the Welsh Government for everyone to get a C grade in the core subjects , but that ate into the time that they had to teach young people . So , the priorities had given priority to GCSE resits rather than doing the Welsh baccalaureate at present . At levels 1 and 2 , there were fewer and fewer doing 1 and 2 in the baccalaureate because they were resitting their GCSEs , and there was much more use of the Welsh bac at level 3 , and A-level , and vocational level 3 .
Kay Martin thought that it was mixed , and it did depend on the admissions tutors and the areas that they were going into in universities . Local universities around Wales , University of South Wales , Cardiff Metropolitan University and USW valued it in a great number of subjects , particularly in sport , business studies and business studies . But when people went further afield , they did not accept it . A great number of their learners got into Cardiff using the Welsh baccalaureate , but would their admissions tutors prefer four A-levels ? Absolutely .
Nick Brazil ( deputy principal ) thought that the Welsh bac was always added as the additional one to the selection of the top universities across a number of universities , particularly in science , technology , engineering and mathematics subjects . Welsh students were fighting for places against Scottish , Northern Irish and English students who were studying three subjects , whereas their Welsh students potentially could be doing three A2s , three A-level subjects plus the Welsh bac . And , as we talked about earlier on , the Welsh bac had evolved into quite a rigorous , you could say complicated , qualification , which put added pressure on a learner in year 2 when they were trying to get possibly three A* grades . So , he thought they needed to consider that .
Dafydd Evans explained that because of the nature of the catchment area , there was a greater percentage of students staying in Welsh universities , and Welsh universities were much more willing to recognise the bac . However , they did have students who were looking to go out to universities in England in the Russell Group , and they were having the same experience there where there were differences between the policy that that university extols and what actually happened on the ground when students had interviews in those universities .
Dafydd Evans thought that training was required regarding the Welsh bac , but where they were seeing it more successfully was where vocational lecturers had actually taken it on board . Nick Brazil thought that the number of the skills and the challenges that were done within the Welsh bac were done very similarly within the vocational qualification as well , so a number of those staff had already got those skills and they were undertaking that . Ed Evans thought that if they wanted to raise the profile amongst parents in particular , if they had a far clearer link between businesses coming in to deliver this , they would have to bring in some experts , bring in some business , raise the profile , and it would start to get parents thinking , 'Actually , there is something more to this than just the academic bit . '
Dafydd Evans was not assured in terms of the training required regarding the Welsh bac , but where they were seeing it more successfully was where vocational lecturers had actually taken it on board . Therefore , no , he thought that if it was going to be a success , it had to be contextualised , and for the vocational lecturers to do that , and they had invested heavily in training those vocational lecturers to understand how to deliver the Welsh bac and get positive outcomes of the Welsh bac .
Nick Brazil thought that the number of the skills and the challenges that were done within the Welsh bac were done very similarly within the vocational qualification as well . A number of those staff had already got those skills and they were undertaking that . Nick Brazil thought that it would raise the focus on the qualification , but ultimately , it would not take away from the fact that they had got staff who had got those skills and they were developing them within other elements of the vocational qualifications they were doing .
The meeting started with a review of the last meeting , and the group discussed the conceptual design of the remote control . Industrial Designer presented on the components design , and Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should have a fancy look and feel , fancy technology , and the ease of use . Marketing presented on the marketing campaign and suggested that the remote control should be made with a fruit and vegetable theme . User Interface presented on the user interface design and suggested that the remote control should be made of rubber and the remote control should be made of plastic . Marketing also suggested that the remote control should be made of plastic and the remote control should be made of rubber . Then , the group discussed the circuit board design and discussed the material of the remote control .
Marketing suggested that the first thing to aim for was a fancy look and feel , followed by the technologic technology and the innovations to do with that , and the last thing was the easy to use factor . Marketing also suggested that the fruit and vegetable theme was the current trend and the group agreed to go for that . Marketing also suggested that the material should be spongy .
Industrial Designer firstly mentioned that they would be custom designing the case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case to protect the remote and the locator . They would also need to custom design a circuit board , because the circuit board had to take the button input and send it to the output so they would have to design that each time . Then , standard parts included the buttons and the wheels , the iPod-style wheel , infrared L_E_D_ , radio sender and receiver , and a beeper or buzzer for locating the remote . They could use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium , but Industrial Designer recommended against titanium because it could only be used in the flat cases and it was really heavy .
User Interface thought that the remote control should be a touch-based graphical interface system , and that the screen should be a screen with music because people would need a screen with music to find a specific song . Marketing thought that the screen should be on the telly so that people could switch to TV channels . Project Manager thought that the wheel should be the only way to control the remote control .
Industrial Designer first suggested batteries , solar power , and a dynamo , which was a kinetic thing where you 'd basically have to wind it yourself . Marketing suggested that a dynamo was a bicycle mechanism , which was like a bicycle mechanism . Project Manager thought solar power was not available with the rubber case , so Industrial Designer picked battery . Marketing also suggested that Kryptonite was cool because it could store energy when thrown .
Industrial Designer thought that the team could have chosen a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power , but he thought solar power was not available with the rubber case and batteries were good because it was a kinetic thing where the user would basically have to wind it himself .
Marketing thought that the Kryptonite was cool because it could store loads of energy and users did n't need to buy a battery . However , the cost of the Kryptonite was not known because there was not enough data to know the exact cost . Industrial Designer thought that the chip was the most expensive part of the energy , which was the reason why the cost was not known .
The meeting started with the User Interface 's presentation of the prototype of the remote control , which was a square with round corners and a square shape with a logo on it . The material should be hard plastic , colour changeable , and transparent . The buttons were basic and the remote control could only be used for speech recognition . The team agreed to use the advanced chip for speech recognition . The team then discussed the budget of the remote control and the budget was decided to be $10,000 .
Marketing made a presentation about the evaluation criteria , and the team agreed that the difference between beautiful and fancy look-and-feel was between the outside and the outside look-and-feel . The team agreed that the fancy look-and-feel was like the iPod , with flashing lights and the colours and that kind of stuff . The team also agreed that the basic colours should be black , yellow and yellow , and the buttons should be in different colours .
The team agreed that the scroll wheel was handy , but the second layer was not easy to use . The team thought that the scroll wheel was easy to use if users had ever used a different kind of device . Marketing thought learnable was a less than easy to use , and easy to use came after learnable .
Marketing recommended to make a power indicator , a button to call it , and a speaker to make it beep . The production cost of the battery was twelve point three Euros , and the speaker was very small .
The team thought that the smart board was okay , but digital pen was horrible and did n't work . User Interface thought it would be great if users could edit the drawing from the drawing board from where they were sitting . Project Manager agreed and suggested that the drawing board could be used as a drawing board .
User Interface said that the team got the wrong information at the wrong time . He thought that the biggest problem was the prices . He thought that they should have known the prices before , so that they could have had a discussion quicker .
The meeting was the first meeting of the team and the Project Manager introduced the project plan and the agenda of the meeting . The team members got to know each other better by drawing their favourite animals on the white board and discussing their ideas about the remote control . The team agreed that the remote control should be user-friendly and friendly to all kinds of animals , including dogs , cats , and grannies to kids . The team also agreed that the remote control should be sitting down and could be used by anyone . The team then discussed the conceptual design of the remote control and the detailed design of the product .
Marketing thought that the remote control should be user-friendly to everyone and aimed at the international market like Australia , America , and Australia . Project Manager agreed and said that the remote control should be easy to use and not complicated to look at . Marketing also suggested that the remote control should be simple and easy to use and not complicated to look at . User Interface agreed and suggested that the remote control should have a LCD display and a menu button .
Marketing thought that a menu display on a remote control would be useful and suggested that it would be easier to navigate and browse and navigate . Project Manager agreed and pointed out that it would not make the remote control complicated to look at . Industrial Designer agreed and suggested that instead of having too many b buttons and making it complicated for the user , the remote control could have an L-D display or something like that .
Industrial Designer thought that the older generation would be more likely to be confused by the remote control design and would not be able to use teletext or tape things .
Industrial Designer thought that the remote control could still be made of lightweight plastic , which was easily moulded and produced . Marketing agreed that the remote control could be made of plastic and did not need to be fashionable . Marketing also thought that the remote control could be made of plastic and not metal , which was the main point of the meeting .
The group agreed that the selling price of the remote control should be 25 Euros , which is about 17.5 Euros . However , the production cost was 12.5 Euros , which was about 17.5 Euros . The profit aim was 50 million Euros , which was a huge margin .
Marketing thought that the market range international was not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it was everyone . Project Manager agreed and said that the remote control would be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that .
The meeting started with the presentation of three presentations from the three members of the team . User Interface presented the concept of user interface , which was a combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions . User Interface suggested that the remote control should be a combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions . Marketing presented the concept of fancy controller , which was a fancy controller that was attractive and easy to recognise . Industrial Designer presented the concept of intelligent controller , which was a combination of voice recognition and gesture recognition technology . Project Manager suggested that the team should cooperate with a research institute on speech recognition and gesture recognition .
User Interface presented three concepts of the user interface design . The first one was a Google controller , the second was a fancy controller , and the last one was intelligent . The first concept was easy to use , the second was fancy , and the third was intelligent . Project Manager asked about the advanced features of the intelligent controller . User Interface suggested that the advanced features could be speech recognition and gesture recognition technology . Project Manager agreed and suggested that the team should cooperate with a research institute on speech recognition and gesture recognition .
User Interface proposed that the user interface designer thought it was convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . Industrial Designer thought that the problem was not only the issue of controller , it was also the issue of the T-V . Marketing thought that the feature was not one hundred percent reliable , but it was a feature to distinguish the product from other products . Project Manager thought that the feature was not expensive .
Project Manager thought that most of the people would be bored after a while , and that if they used the same gesture all the time , they would get injuries because of that . User Interface thought that it would be convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . Project Manager thought that speech recognition was reliable and for limited vocabulary gesture recognition was also very reliable . Project Manager also thought that the intelligent controller would not cost much and would not be expensive .
Industrial Designer first proposed to use a combination of wooden and plastic material for the remote control . Then Industrial Designer proposed to have a combination of solar energy and regular battery for the remote control . Project Manager agreed to have both of them and thought that the solar energy battery would add a little bit of the price , but it would be an added value that would be compensated . Industrial Designer also proposed to have a combination of both solar energy and regular battery for the remote control .
Industrial Designer thought that for the alimentation , it would be good to have both the classical battery and solar energy alimentation , so that in some country where you are in the countryside and you are far from the cities , if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come back . It can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con and it can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . Project Manager thought it was an added value to the remote control and maybe it could attract all the ecological consumers .
Industrial Designer first proposed to use a wooden remote control or a plastic remote control like this one . Then Industrial Designer said that the buttons could be classic push buttons like this one or some buttons that were unlighted during the night . Then Industrial Designer said that the material of the remote control would be wood because it was resistant and special .
Marketing thought that the user really really wanted a fancy look and feel , but they were not so interested in functional look and feel . The second point was that they wanted it to be technologically innovative , so they could have both part of wood and some rubber for the buttons . The third point was that it was important that it was easy to use .
The marketing recommended that fancy look and feel was the most important one , and the spongy touch was the second most important one . The marketing also suggested that the remote control could have wood in the bottom and rubber for the buttons .
Marketing mentioned that the main point of the discussion was that the user requirement was to have a spongy touch , which was the trend in fashion . Industrial Designer suggested that the product should be made of plastic-like material , but Marketing suggested that the product could be made of rubber and wood . Project Manager agreed that the product could be made of wood and rubber for the buttons .
The meeting was mainly about the functional design of the remote control . Marketing first introduced the meeting and gave a brief summary of the meeting 's previous meetings . Marketing then introduced the functional requirements of the remote control , including the buttons , the buttons that were most important to the user , the remote control 's appearance and the technical effects . Marketing then introduced the market research results and suggested that the remote control should be designed according to the user 's preference and the frequency of use . User Interface then gave a presentation on the user requirements of the remote control , including the buttons , the cable , the buttons , the remote control 's appearance and the technical effects .
The group discussed the functional design of the remote control based on user needs , technical effects , and the working design of the remote control . Marketing made a list of the buttons that they should focus on in order of importance . The most important buttons were those to do channel selection , teletext , volume , power , and power settings . Marketing also suggested that the buttons should be designed according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each button . User Interface suggested that the remote control should be made with a combination of the LCD screen and speech recognition . Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control should be made with a rubber material and a rubber case .
The group agreed that the finder button would be easy to implement and easy to find . Industrial Designer suggested that the buzzer would be a locator and the remote would send out a signal and the remote would hear the signal and beeps . Marketing thought that the buzzer should be on the TV itself and the remote should be on the phone . User Interface thought that the buzzer should be fashionable and the remote should be fashionable . Marketing thought that the remote should be able to be put on the TV or on the wall .
Marketing suggested that the speech recognition design should be only for speech recognition and screen . Industrial Designer thought that speech recognition was hard to programme and that the screen was the same as the screen . Project Manager agreed that speech recognition was a good idea but it might be a little pricey for the budget .
Project Manager suggested that the team should decide whether they want to have VCR / VHR / DVD capability . User Interface and Industrial Designer thought that they should have a general remotes for the remote control . Marketing thought that they could design the channels as a power button , which was not used much . Project Manager agreed and suggested that they could reduce the number of buttons to one .
The meeting was about Robert 's thesis proposal and the recording of the participants ' voices . The meeting was mostly about the recording of the participants ' voices . The professor suggested that the group should start off by doing the digits all at the same time . The group discussed the possibility of recording the participants ' voices in different voices . The professor also suggested that the team could rehearse their voices .
The thesis proposal was presented to the team and discussed by the professor . The proposal was about the construction of a probabilistic relational model that could potentially build a general , domain-general rules how things were construed . The idea was to use ontology , situation , user , and discourse model to instantiate elements in the classes of the probabilistic relational model to do some inferences in terms of what was being construed as what .
The team was discussing the problems with the rephrasing , and how they solved it . They were also trying to match their prosody onto the machine . They were also starting to look at people 's brains in a more direct way .
The talk was about the problems with the rephrasing , and how they solved it , and some preliminary observations . The professor also mentioned that the team was planning to start looking at people 's brains in a more direct way . The team was also planning to do this , which they were planning to do .
The meeting started with the presentation of the conceptual model of the remote control , which included the basic functions , the appearance of the remote control , the appearance of the case and interface , the appearance of the remote control , and the technical features of the remote control . Then , the group discussed the conceptual model of the remote control , which included the fancy look-and-feel , the technological innovative features , and the easy to learn design of the remote control . Then , the group discussed the material of the remote control , and the material of the case and interface . Finally , the group discussed the conceptual model of the remote control , which included the material of the case and interface , the material of the case and interface , and the material of the case and interface .
Marketing presented the market trend of fancy look-and-feel and technological innovation in the remote control market . The market trend was that fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . The remote control should be technological innovative and should use some of the new technology . User Interface suggested that the remote control should be able to use flashing light and speech recognition .
Marketing thought that fancy look was the most important thing for remote control , so he thought about changeable fronts . Marketing suggested a see-through one in a fruit front because it was hot . Marketing also suggested that they could make five different fronts to start with .
User Interface recommended to use speech as a technology innovation because the technology department had done research about it and there were more possibilities now with speech . So they recommended using it .
User Interface suggested that they should put in a circuit board , like a chip board , transistors and resonators , and rechargeable batteries . Industrial Designer suggested that they could use batteries or kinetic energy sources for the energy source . Project Manager agreed and suggested that they could use solar cells or kinetic energy . User Interface suggested that they could use scroll wheels for the volume and scroll wheels for the volume .
User Interface suggested that the remote should be made of a modern design like the iPod and the iPod display . The remote should be made of plastic and the home base should be made of plastic . The remote should be made of plastic and the remote control should be made of plastic .
Marketing believed that the remote features had to be original and technological innovative . Project Manager agreed to put speech recognition in it , but the advanced chip was not included . User Interface suggested that the team could put all the functions of speech recognition in the chip , but the advanced chip was not included .
The meeting was the sixth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 pandemic . The meeting was taking place by videoconference . The petitioners asked the government to look at the situation with the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board , which was scheduled to go through some important and potentially detrimental regulatory changes very soon . They asked that the amendments to the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board be rescinded , as these would restrict Canadians from receiving life-saving medications for cystic fibrosis and other illnesses , but in particular , a medicine called Trikafta , which can have the effect of treating cystic fibrosis in the case of 90 % of cystic fibrosis sufferers . The petitioners also called on the government to work with the government to find a collaborative solution to find a holistic solution so that every Canadian has a family doctor and we address the family doctor shortage .
The Prime Minister said that the government had been focused entirely on getting help to Canadians when they needed it , and that had meant that there would be things that would need to be cleaned up after the fact and work to fix , but getting that help into Canadians ' pockets during this pandemic was the priority . The Prime Minister also promised that the government would keep on supporting Canadians .
Mr. Gabriel Ste-Marie (Joliette, BQ) asked why the Prime Minister continued to support the profiteers . He thought that the Prime Minister should tighten the screws on the companies that legally took advantage of tax havens to avoid paying their taxes . The Prime Minister answered that the government would always be there to counter tax evasion and tax avoidance .
Hon . Bill Blair supported banning Iver Johnson because the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police declared that military assault rifles were produced for the sole purpose of killing people in large numbers and urged the government to enact legislation to ban all military assault rifles , except for law enforcement and military purposes . The Ontario police leaders said that they support a prohibition on all military-designed rifles . In their view , these weapons had no place in our communities and should be reserved for use by Canada 's and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and and
The opposition party argued that the government had not provided a universal direct payment for all , and that the government had decided to implement a complicated program that left many people behind . The Prime Minister pointed out that the government had moved in the most rapid and simplest way in providing income replacement to millions upon millions of Canadians who needed it through the Canada emergency response benefit . However , when one moved quickly and efficiently , there would be gaps , and that 's why the government had been working diligently to try to fill those gaps .
Ms. Jenny Kwan said that the government had decided to implement a complicated program that left many people behind . A single parent with four school-age children lost her spousal and child support due to COVID-19 , but she was not eligible for CERB . The Minister of Employment said that she was looking into this gap , but it had been weeks , and still no action . Ms. Kwan asked the Prime Minister to fix this gap so that the single parents and their children could get the support they needed during this pandemic . The Prime Minister said that the government had been working diligently to try to fill those gaps , and they were serious about fighting homelessness and supporting vulnerable Canadians .
Hon. Judy Sgro asked about the support for the elderly during the COVID-19 pandemic . The minister explained that the government had announced a one-time , tax-free payment of $ 300 for seniors eligible for OAS and an additional $ 200 for seniors eligible for GIS . This meant there would be up to $ 500 for the most vulnerable seniors to help them with their financial security to get through this challenging time . Beyond this , the government also announced $ 20 million to expand the new horizons for seniors program to kick-start initiatives and services that would help seniors for example , to get grocery deliveries right to their door and to stay connected .
The Minister of Finance promised to support the energy resources and tourism and funding in green economy and small businesses . The opposition party members expressed concern about the support for energy resources and tourism and funding in green economy and small businesses .
Hon. Jacques Gourde asked about the situation of the tourism industry and the government 's response to it . He asked about the government 's commitment to protect the tourism industry and the investment in tourism infrastructure and upgrades to ensure Canada 's tourist regions were ready when the economy reopens . Hon. Chrystia Freeland assured the members of the House that they would continue to work with Canadian processors as the agreement comes into force .
Hon . Bill Morneau explained that the government had moved forward with a number of measures that were designed to be of assistance . With respect to rent support , they were encouraging landlords to support this measure . Obviously , rent and landlord-tenant relations were under provincial jurisdiction . At every opportunity , Morneau talked to the provincial finance ministers to encourage them to get engaged there .
Hon . Bernadette Jordan ( Minister of Fisheries , Oceans and the Canadian Coast Guard ) answered questions about fishing and tourism , oil and gas affected by the Covid-19 . The minister explained that the fish and seafood sector had been extremely adversely affected because of COVID-19 . She also explained that the government had started to put measures in place to address the issue with the $ 62.5 million for processors , as well as to make sure that the CERB was available for seasonal workers as well as people who had run out of their fishery EI .
According to Public Services and Procurement Canada , despite 1.8 billion units of PPE being procured , less than 6 % of N95 respirator orders had been filled , less than 8 % of surgical mask orders had been filled , and just 1.4 % of face shield orders had been filled . The government was aggressively buying life-saving equipment and supplies that Canada needed , from a diverse range of suppliers around the world and here at home . The government was working directly with businesses across the country to rapidly scale up domestic production capacity to meet current and future needs .
The oil and gas industry was under severe strain due to the pressure from anti-oil and gas lobby groups demanding that the oil sands be shut down . The federal Liberal government 's response to the anti-oil lobby was the introduction of the no more pipelines bill , Bill C-69 , which would prevent any major oil and gas projects from being developed in Canada . The oil shipping ban , Bill C-48 , for the northern coast of British Columbia , also had a negative effect on the oil industry . These two bills alone pushed over $ 200 billion of investment out of Canada , causing the Alberta economy to retract to recession levels . To compound Alberta 's economic problems , the international oil price war and the COVID-19 pandemic , which caused a huge drop in demand for oil . 48 days after the finance minister promised liquidity loans to oil producers and service companies , there were still no applications open for these loans .
The meeting was about the Children , Young People and Education Committee 's discussion on the Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment Bill . The meeting was mainly about the views of Barry Hughes , Chief Crown Prosecutor for Wales , Kwame Biney , senior policy advisor , CPS , and Iwan Jenkins , head of the complex casework unit , Crown Prosecution Service Cymru Wales . The meeting began with questions from members about the current law and the Bill . The first question was about the current law , and the second was about the Bill 's impact on the CPS . The meeting ended with a discussion on the Bill 's impact on the CPS and the CPS 's view on the Bill .
Sian Gwenllian AM asked Barry Hughes to explain how the law currently stands and specifically in terms of reasonable punishment . Barry Hughes firstly explained that the criminal law provided for offences of assault against a variety of people , including offences that were specific to children . In respect of children in particular , the Children Act 2004 did make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child . However , it was not available for an offence involving an adult . In that regard , it could be argued that children had fewer rights than adults . Then Sian Gwenllian AM asked if the CPS had a view on this . Barry Hughes answered that it would make things clearer . However , he was not sure it would make them much clearer , because it was often the case that things were n't just black and white ; there were multiple shades of grey in between .
Barry Hughes thought that the criminal law provided for a range of offences created by the criminal law , going back to the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 in the middle of the century before last , which provide for offences of assault against a variety of people , including offences that were specific to children . In respect of children in particular , section 58 of the Children Act 2004 did make it a defence for a person accused of assaulting a child to argue that it was a case where they were acting only so as to impose reasonable punishment upon the child . That was a defence that was available for assault upon a child . By way of contrast , it was not available for an offence involving an adult . In that regard , it could be argued that children had fewer rights than adults .
The first stage was whether there was sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction , and the second was whether the evidential stage was satisfied . The police applied the same code before they brought a case to the CPS . They only got on to the public interest stage once the evidential stage was satisfied .
Barry Hughes first gave two examples of the implications of the divergence between the law in England and Wales . Firstly , the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England , because the defence would still apply there . This raised issues in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales . Secondly , the CPS recognised this and had a specific provision that took account of the potential divergence of Welsh law . In terms of how they would approach it within the Crown Prosecution Service in Cymru-Wales , Barry Hughes would work with Kwame and his colleagues to make sure that the guidance that they issue nationally suits both England and Wales .
Barry Hughes thought that the removal of the defence would mean that there would be more cases that would pass the evidential stage in Wales than there would be in England , because the defence would still apply there . This would raise issues in terms of awareness of criminal offending for people from England who travel to Wales , because it 's fairly evident that there would be a defence available in England that was not available in Wales . And so , there were issues there in terms of the awareness of members of the public . The second example he gave was that they already had within the United Kingdom a certain degree of divergence of laws , and the CPS recognises this . In their code , they had a specific provision that took account of the potential divergence of Welsh law . They would issue policy guidance and charging standards to reflect any changes as they arise . And they were sufficiently flexible to take account of that .
Barry Hughes thought that draft changes to CPS guidance on the public interest test would not necessarily be helpful . He thought that they would simply want to take the present public interest factors , which were set out , in his view , very clearly in the code for Crown prosecutors , and they would provide a degree of detail around those that relates more specifically to the issues that they were discussing here . So , it would be taking principles of generality and according them a degree of specificity . And they would need to work that up as they went along , and he thought you 'd run a risk of putting the cart before the horse , if I may put it like that .
Barry Hughes first explained that the police had been working with the National Police Chiefs ' Council , which was responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals . He also explained that the police were primarily responsible for the decision , and they were not responsible for administering the out-of-court disposal or monitoring compliance with that disposal . Then , he answered questions about awareness raising , which was mentioned in the Bill in Scotland , but there was no such duty in this Bill .
Barry Hughes said that the police had been working with the National Police Chiefs ' Council . Their lead was deputy chief constable Sara Glen , who was responsible for developing the police approach to out-of-court disposals and simplifying the range of out-of-court disposals . There was quite a range , and life would be simpler and clearer to have fewer types of disposal with more clarity about what each one of them involved .
Barry Hughes thought that within Wales , within Wales , you could build an infrastructure that provides for a range of out-of-court disposals . It may be that the police and crime commissioners use some of their commissioning powers to work something up .
Sian Gwenllian asked about the unintended consequences of the new law , and Barry Hughes answered that it would be different if someone living in Wales who ca n't use the reasonable punishment defence would be prosecuted . He also answered that the CPS did n't have targets for securing convictions or not . And he also said that the CPS would be very surprised if they even had referrals that reached double figures on these cases .
Barry Hughes thought that the CPS did n't have targets for securing convictions or not . Clearly , they prosecute if they think that there 's a reasonable prospect , a realistic prospect , of conviction and it 's in the public interest , but they have no targets . And he would also say that because the numbers here were likely to be so small , any assertion of looking to meet targets would be a tiny fragment of a drop in the ocean .
Karen Cornish thought that there was a shortage of registered intermediaries in Wales , and the Ministry of Justice had taken action to deal with that , and they had had a number of people who were now in a position to act as intermediaries . Now , of course , if they were to decide not to do that anymore , they may have a problem , but in turn , they would be looking to recruit more people into those positions .
The meeting was mainly about collecting more data for the project . The team discussed the nature of the data that they were collecting and how they could use it to further the project . The team also discussed the possibility of getting more regular meetings to get more data . The team also discussed the possibility of adding a second phase of data collection to the project .
The advantage of using Noisy-ORs was that the team could still hear the acoustic with the background . The noise was like a ground level , not total silence . The noise was similar to the noise from tape clips and claps .
The professor suggested that the noise should be in the form of nonspeech segments that do n't have impulsive noises . The noise should be in the form of steady-state noises . The idea was that the noise should be labeled with a label for each frame and a cluster algorithm .
The professor suggested that the digit recordings should be done at the end of the meeting , so that participants can run off to other meetings and get fewer sets of digits . This would cut into people 's time , which would make the time for collecting data less .
The team thought that they should have enough data to work with . They were hoping that they would start recording regularly . They were also hoping that they would have enough data from different domains .
The meeting began with a brief introduction to the current status of the project . The team was working on the task data and the results of their training of neural networks on the task data . The team was mainly focusing on four features , such as the PLP , PLP with JRASTA , MSG , and MFCC from the baseline Aurora . The team was also working on the broad English and the Italian data . The team was also working on the broad English and Spanish databases . The team was also working on the task data and the model was performing well .
The professor thought that the effect of training on different languages was not as bad as it seemed . He thought that it might simply be a case that the model was more diverse , and that they had to be careful because of the compounded results . The team thought that the model was performing well , but they still had to wait and see .
PhD D explained that the multilingual net was trained on features without the s derivatives without the s derivatives but with increased frame numbers . The model was slightly worse when it did n't use delta .
The Professor thought that the use of English was not so much a problem because of the lack of representation of English , but because the model was more diverse . He thought that the team should be careful because of the compounded results . He thought that they had to be careful because of the compounded results .
The team discussed the complexity of the model and the possibility of adding features to the model . The professor thought that the model was too complex and that it would get worse if it did not have enough features . The team thought that adding features to the model would help it to be more robust .
The team discussed the IBM computers , which they hoped to use to build a big IBM machine . They were not using Gin because the old one had died and they were getting a new one , which would be a faster server . They were also concerned about the computational limits of the IBM computers .
The team thought that the delay introduced by the LDA was within the boundaries of the boundaries of the LDA . The professor explained that the temporal LDA did in fact include the same delay .
The meeting was mainly about the recording of the recording of the recording of the voice-recognition experiment . The professor asked the team to start recording and then asked them to think about the demo stuff . The team was asked to think about the recording interface and the question answering function . The team also discussed the choice of the recording device and the choice of the recording device . The team also discussed the possibility of exploiting the voice-recognition function to extract the same digits at different times .
The team decided to do something with the transcriber interface , but they also wanted to do something with the transcriber interface .
The professor thought that the team was going to do a mock-up of a question answering function , which was separate from the transcriber interface . The team was going to do this in a pre- stored fashion . The professor thought that they were going to do this before the transcriber , but it was not ready yet .
The professor thought that the team was not ready to hire twelve transcribers , which would be a lot of work . He thought that they could hire five or six transcribers at a time , which would be a small enough number to be flexible . The team was also working on the transcriptions , which were done by now . The team was also working on creating speech- nonspeech labels out of the transcriptions .
The professor thought that the team had been cheating by using hand-segmentation as the basis of the recognition . He wanted to move to doing the recognition on automatic segmentations .
The segmenter is performing well and the team is considering moving to automatic segmentation . The professor thought that the team had been cheating by using hand-segmentation as the basis of the recognition .
The segmenter is now using Thilo 's posteriors or some kind of discrete models for background noise .
This meeting was the first meeting to generate some ideas about the new product of the project . Project Manager introduced the team members to each other and the project plan of the project . Project Manager introduced the project kick-off and the team members were given a brief introduction of the project plan . Project Manager then introduced the project goal of the project and the team members were asked to give a presentation on the project . The team members then discussed the conceptual development of the product and the progress of the project . The team members agreed that the product should be trendy and user-friendly . Project Manager then introduced the team to the market and the team members were asked to give a presentation on the project plan .
Industrial Designer proposed that the remote control should control a diverse subset of equipment , such as cell phones , video and audio equipment , and there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . User Interface proposed that the remote should be a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in a store . Project Manager agreed and said that the remote should work on different devices . Marketing suggested that the remote should fit every device .
User Interface thought that the remote control should work on different devices , and that it should be a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in a store . User Interface also thought that the technical function of the remote control should be to change the state of the TV .
Industrial Designer thought that a modern remote control should control a diverse subset of equipment , such as cell phones , video and audio equipment , so that there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
Industrial Designer thought that infrared was a little bit old-fashioned , but it was cost-effective and most TV sets were equipped with infrared . User Interface thought that infrared and Bluetooth could be combined in one remote . Project Manager thought the remote control should be rechargeable and should not consume too much power . Marketing thought that the remote control should be rechargeable and the product should be made of plastic and not of metal .
Industrial Designer suggested that infrared was not really hot technical stuff anymore , so they should think about the things like Bluetooth . User Interface suggested that infrared was a little bit old-fashioned , but all the TV sets were equipped with infrared , so Industrial Designer agreed that it was cost-effective .
User Interface thought Bluetooth might be problem because it used a lot of power . Project Manager thought that the remote control should be rechargeable and not consume too much power . User Interface thought that Bluetooth was not necessary .
The meeting started with the Project Manager introducing the new project requirements , which included that the remote control should only be used for television and that the product should be aimed at a younger group of people . The group also agreed that the product should be recognisable and the colour and slogan of the product should be in the colour of the company 's colour and the slogan should be in the slogan . Then the group discussed the individual presentations of the team members and the individual presentations of the team members . The meeting ended with a discussion on the product , the target group , the functions of the remote control , and the budget of the project .
User Interface suggested that the remote control should be made easy to use and advanced . Marketing thought that the remote control should be user-friendly and easy to use . Marketing also thought that the remote control should be made with basic functions like channel selection , volume and teletext . Project Manager agreed and agreed with Marketing and Industrial Designer that the remote control should be made with basic functions like channel selection , volume and teletext .
Industrial Designer thought that the ten digits were not relevant to the remote control design . He thought that the ten buttons were enough for the regular TV user and the older people only used five of them . He thought that the ten buttons looked dull and the Nokia had ten digits on their phones and it still looked fancy . He also thought that the younger people would probably watch more channels than the older people . He also thought that speech recognition was a good idea and it would be easy to find the remote control .
User Interface thought that the main function of remote control was to send messages to the television set , so the multi-function remote control with many possibilities was not enough . User Interface preferred the ease-of-use remote control with less possibilities but a great feeling in touching the buttons .
Industrial Designer suggested that the most easy way to send messages to a TV set was by sending pulses of infrared light to a TV set . Project Manager agreed that the team should use energy-friendly components which consume far less power than conventional components . Industrial Designer also suggested that rechargeable design or energy-save design should be implemented .
Marketing suggested that the team should add an audio signal to the remote control to help customers find it . Industrial Designer thought that the team should focus on the buttons to zap and volume . User Interface suggested that the remote control should have a design for only those buttons . Project Manager agreed and suggested that the team should get some new technologies for it .
Industrial Designer suggested that there were some hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . Industrial Designer thought that if they could include a cradle in which it could recharge , then there would n't be a big problem .
The meeting started with Industrial Designer and User Interface presenting the prototype of the remote control , which was made with a kinetic charger , a soft case material , a rubberised outer casing , a bright funky design inspired by fruit , bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel , and voice recognition software . Then , Marketing presented the prototype of the remote control , which was made with a standard chip , a stand-by function , a LCD screen , a rubber case , and a combination of L-C-D and rubber buttons . The group then discussed the design of the remote control , which was decided to use a kinetic charger , a stand-by function , a soft case material , a bright design , bright funky designs inspired by fruit , and a clam-shell design .
Marketing introduced the first stage of the evaluation of the prototype of the new remote control based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of the company . The group agreed that the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours were the two main ones , and the design should minimise R-S-I and be easy to locate . The group also agreed that the remote control should incorporate current fashion trends and the team was still ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there .
Marketing thought that the spongy feel was no problem with the rubber case because the spongy feel would be in the rubber case . Marketing also thought that the team could use any strong fruit and vegetable colours and that 's what they were intending to do .
Marketing thought that the team had not come up with anything that could feasibly reduce that . Marketing thought that the size of the remote control was quite small and the amount of stuff they were putting on it was n't that much . Project Manager thought that the remote control should be made with more space so that the user would not move around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between .
The team agreed that the kinetic cost should be three for the number of kinetic cells , and the cost of the chip should be one . The cost of the chip should be one chip , one sample sensor and one sample speaker . The cost of the casing should be one point five . The team agreed that the cost of the rubber should be zero because the plastic was used in the casing . The team agreed that the cost of the chip should be one point five .
User Interface suggested that the kinetic batteries could be replaced with a standard battery and the rubber case could be made curved and flat . User Interface thought that the customers never said anything about the battery and that the battery was internal so nobody would look into it .
The Industrial Designer pointed out that the kinetic was three and the battery was three . Project Manager thought that the kinetic was three and the battery was minus three . Industrial Designer pointed out that the kinetic was twelve point three five and the battery was minus three plus two . Project Manager thought that the kinetic was three and the battery was minus three . Project Manager thought that the kinetic was three and the battery was minus three . Project Manager thought that the voice recognition was wonderful , but the object was so distinctive that it would make it easier to locate as a first instance . Project Manager thought that the voice recognition was good because it would set the product apart from the crowd .
The meeting began with the professor introducing the overall plan of the meeting . The team discussed the general design of the influence structure of what they think influences what . The professor suggested that the team should start with the path ones and then move on to the belief-net . The team also discussed the idea of having a binary version of the decision function for Go . The professor also suggested that the team could start with the belief-net and then move on to the belief-net .
The professor suggested that the team should start with the path ones , which are the most interesting to them . The professor also suggested that they should start with the belief-net , the general influence stuff and then they would talk about the techy stuff . The team also discussed the idea of doing a binary search for the Go-there effect , which was rejected by the professor because it would be too complex to do for the present time . The team also discussed the idea of doing a binary search for the Go-there effect , which was rejected by the professor because it would be too complex to do for the present time .
The professor explained that the program was actually a GUI to a simulator that would wind up with a functioning belief-net at the other end . The professor also suggested that the belief-net should be non-local and that the updates of the net should be external to the decision .
The professor thought that the team should make sure that the recording equipment was in the correct location . He thought that the team should make sure that the recording equipment was in the correct position .
The professor suggested that the team should get the influence of the ontology down to what they think is likely to be a strong influence . The team thought that the ontology could be used to help them make decisions about the ontology . The professor also suggested that they could add a property to the belief-net to determine whether a thing is accessible to a tourist .
Grad B thought that the idea of compatibility with the requirements of an action to the state of the user could be used for multiple decisions . Grad B thought that the node they were creating right now was user compatibility to the current action , which was the right node . Grad C thought that the issue was that everything in the user model would contribute to whether or not the user was compatible with something . Grad B thought that they should make it sufficiently simple to make it sufficiently simple to make it sufficiently feasible . Grad B thought that they should look at the endpoint again if they split up the endpoint into sort of the sort of the same sort of nodes .
The professor thought that the current plan was not working well enough and suggested that they switch to another one . He also suggested that they could keep the old one and see if they could reuse any of the stuff .
The meeting was about twenty-five minutes long and the group discussed the design of the remote control . Project Manager introduced the project and the team members got to know each other 's personal characteristics and the project goals . Project Manager then made a presentation on the project and the team members got to know the project goals and the team members were asked to draw favourite animals on the whiteboard . Then the team members got to know the functional design of the remote control and the conceptual design of the remote control .
The group agreed that the remote control should be universal , which meant that it could be used for more than television . It should be clear and user-friendly , so that it could be used by kids and the elderly . The infrared technology should be from a good quality . The group also agreed that the remote control should be big enough for the buttons and the buttons should be in a position that the user could see them .
The Project Manager thought that the conceptual design of the remote control would be universal because it would be sold in a big market in Europe and the production cost were about half the price of selling price .
The Marketing thought that a touchscreen on the remote control would be too expensive and that it would be impossible to reach the remote control .
Industrial Design suggested to put the remote control in a recharger or a home station to recharge it on the TV . Project Manager agreed that it was a good idea , but Industrial Designer questioned how expensive it would be to buy a recharger separately from the phone . Marketing agreed that a home station was a good idea because lots of people lost their remote control and did n't know where it was .
Marketing set out the requirements of the remote control on the size , looks , usable , the buttons on usable places , the shape and the appearance of the remote control . User Interface suggested that the basic things on the remote control should be on the same place , like the on off button on top and the T-V channels one two three four as a block , and the volume on top , and the basic options on top . Marketing thought that the remote control should be made of plastic and the strength should be the same as a normal remote control . Industrial Designer thought that the remote control should be made of plastic and the shape should be square . Project Manager agreed and suggested that the remote control should be made of plastic and the shape should be square .
User Interface suggested that the basic things should be put on the same place , like the on off button on top and the TV channels as a block as a block , and the volume obviously on t on top , so that users can see . But the rest of the buttons should be clear as well , so if there was a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well .
The meeting started with the presentation of three presentations from the three teams , Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and Industrial Designer . The first presentation was from User Interface Designer , who proposed to design a remote control with sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . The second presentation was from Industrial Designer , who proposed to design a remote control with powerful functions but with easy to use interface . The third presentation was from Marketing , who proposed to design a remote control with many functions and easy to use . The meeting ended with the discussion of the new product requirements and the decision on the remote control functions .
User Interface presented the technical function design for user interface for the remote control . User Interface proposed to design a Google-style remote control with sophisticated functions and easy to use interface . Industrial Designer proposed to design a remote control with international standards and a power off button . Marketing proposed to design a remote control with a simple and elegant interface . Project Manager proposed to design a remote control with powerful functions and easy to use interface .
User Interface proposed to design a Google-like remote control with sophisticated functions and easy to use interface . Industrial Designer proposed to merge the two system and said that the international standards should be included in the design so that the user would know how to use the remote control .
Industrial Designer thought that the remote control would be able to connect to the internet , but Marketing thought that it would be more for browsing . User Interface suggested that the remote control could be fitted with a set box to connect to the internet . Marketing thought that the remote control would be too expensive for the global usage .
Industrial Designer first proposed to use an infrared base as the remote control , which was cheaper than laser and less technology than laser . Industrial Designer also proposed to use a wireless remote control , which was preferred by the User Interface . Marketing thought that the average price of the infrared base was eight Euros , which was around eight Euros . Industrial Designer thought that the wireless remote control was better because it was easier to manage and the battery problem could hold .
The industrial designer thought that the technology would cost eight Euros and the project manager thought it would be cheaper . However , the project manager thought that the wireless problem was more the David Jordan 's problem . He thought that the usability of the remote control was more important than the cost .
User Interface designer thought that it was possible to mix several function in one button . Project Manager was not sure if it would be easy to use because if they had many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . User Interface suggested that they could have a switch menu to switch between different functions .
Marketing informed the team that seventy five percent of the users found the most remote controls ugly , and eighty percent of users would spend more money if the remote controls were not so ugly . Industrial Designer suggested that the solution was to have many colours of different colours of the remote control instead of having one grey standard . User Interface thought that the colour of the remote control should be yellow , and the user could select which colour they prefer . Project Manager thought that personalised colour would cost more , and the team agreed that the price of the product should not be too high .
User Interface suggested that a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uniform colourful is fancy for some peoples , so . Industrial Designer thought the solution was to have many colours of grey standard instead of having one grey standard . Project Manager thought it would increase the price of the production of the remote control .
Project Manager thought that the product appearance would increase the price of the production of the remote control . He thought that the product should be attractive and fashionable . Project Manager also thought that the product should be easy to use and powerful .
This was the detailed design meeting . The team discussed the prototype of the remote control . The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the prototype of the remote control . The wheel was the wheel that the user used to change channels or volume . The base of the remote control had a squishy spongy rubbery feel and was interchangeable . The remote control could be made of different colours and could be made of different fruit designs . The team decided on the battery case and the advanced chip would be more advanced than the iPod chip . The team also discussed the cost of the production of the remote control .
Industrial Designer introduced the detailed design of the remote control , including the wheel that was the power button , the menu button , the interchangeable base , the vegetable , fruit and vegetable buttons , the beeper , the LCD screen , the LCD screen , the remote control button , the battery case and the locator . The team agreed that the remote control should be hand-holdable and not too big .
The group agreed that the remote control should be made of a material that was technologically innovative . The team also agreed that the wheel should be bigger and the base should be larger . The team also agreed that the remote control should be made of a material that was comfortable to hold .
The team members thought the prototype making was creatively stimulating and the product was fun and met all the criteria . Project Manager thought the team worked very well together and the leadership and teamwork was good . Project Manager thought the leadership was crap personally and thought the team did n't have their set roles so much . Marketing thought the team did n't really have their set roles so much and they all had ideas about it . Project Manager thought the team did n't really do PowerPoint presentations and made up their own stuff and did n't really do like doing the presentation stuff .
Marketing thought that the worst one was three point one and the group agreed that it was the material . Project Manager thought that the wheel should be bigger and the base should be larger because some of the remote controls were not as easy to hold . Industrial Designer thought that the wheel should be bigger and the base should be larger because some of the remote controls were not as easy to hold . User Interface thought that the remote control should be made of fruit and the group agreed that the broccoli was comfortable .
Industrial Designer thought it was good because they knew what they were doing and it was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute . Project Manager thought his leadership was crap personally because he told them when to start and when to end , and that 's all that matters . But User Interface thought they all worked very well together and they all blended quite well .
Industrial Designer was not a big fan of Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff . Marketing preferred the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things . User Interface thought that the information that was available to him was kind of just like the idea that they had . Project Manager thought that everything was not particularly helpful .
The meeting was about the progress of the Welsh Government 's progress in developing the new curriculum for Wales . Kirsty Williams AM , Minister for Education , introduced the main messages that they had received during the feedback period on the draft curriculum . Kirsty Williams AM was really pleased that there had been broad support for the curriculum changes that they were proposing . There was also support for the principle of a purpose-led curriculum and the emphasis on formative assessment . Kirsty Williams AM also explained that they were reflecting on the messages that they had received and what they were doing to make sure that the process was working well .
The original proposal was to provide for the four purposes of the legislation , which were the four purposes of learning and experience , putting in law the areas of learning and experience that you 'll all be familiar with , the literacy , numeracy and the digital competency , and legislate for a number of the cross-curricular aspects . The two main new areas that they were now working on to include within the Bill were to ensure that there was breadth within the curriculum for everybody and to make a statutory provision for the 'what matters ' statements . They would also be looking to include in the legislation provision for a statutory framework setting out the approach to progression in each of the AoLE areas .
Kirsty Williams AM explained that the area of learning and experience for well-being was already there , and underneath that area of learning title , there were the broad concepts of what matters , what they believe matters , in that area of learning , and it was that that they would now actually put into the legislation .
Claire Bennett explained that the 'what matters ' were the articulation of the big ideas . These were the essence of the core content . The idea was to make sure that those were consistent , and then that still left huge flexibility underneath as to how to approach those , which particular topics to select in how to actually teach them . They were always intended to represent the learning that every learner should get . They wo n't be literally in the Bill , because , obviously , you might want to change the emphasis , so that 'll be provided for in subordinate legislation , but the provision would be there .
Kirsty Williams AM said that the government were big supporters of WISERD and the work that they did , and they needed more research into Welsh education , not less . She also said that the curriculum in itself was neither going to necessarily on its own hugely enhance equity nor detract from equity , in the sense that the curriculum was what was taught in the schools . What would make the curriculum a success for all of the children , and would have a bigger impact on children who were in danger of being left behind were the four enabling purposes of the curriculum .
According to Kirsty Williams , the WISERD research suggested that the senior management teams would buy into what the management teams would certainly buy into what the WISERD research suggested , but the classroom teachers would be a little bit more sceptical . Hefin David AM pointed out that two comments jumped out from the presentation by WISERD at the seminar were that there would be a different accountability framework to the aims and objectives of the new curriculum and that there would be no consistency across all schools in how the new curriculum was delivered which could affect outcomes . Kirsty Williams AM explained that they were trying to ensure that they were developing another accountability regime that was indeed in line with the purposes of the curriculum and did n't work against the purposes of the curriculum .
The meeting discussed the model of Scotland and the lessons that they had learned from it . Kirsty Williams AM said that the curriculum was not a copycat of the Scottish curriculum , but it was always useful to reflect on how other systems had undertaken curriculum reform in their nation and to learn from any issues that had arisen . Assessment had been a crucial part of the process that they had been involved in . Professional learning , ensuring that the profession was properly prepared for the changes , and whether they were truly engaged in what they were doing were also learned .
Kirsty Williams AM explained that the money was the largest investment in professional learning since the history of devolution . There was a national element to it , but they had given the money to individual schools and individual headteachers because they had no way of knowing how each individual practitioner was ready or how much additional support they were going to need . The four regional consortia were working together to have a national approach for the first level of engagement . The next stages would be much more focused on individual AoLE and area-specific professional learning .
The money that was agreed was for a two-year period and Kirsty Williams AM continued to have conversations with the Minister for Finance and the First Minister around future allocations for professional learning .
The meeting discussed the process of the innovation schools , which was the next phase of the curriculum development in Wales . The innovation schools were chosen from 60 applicants from 170 previous pioneer schools , and they were asked to produce a report setting out their reflections on the curriculum as a whole . The report was drawn together into an overall report drawing out the themes by Wavehill , who were a kind of research company . The innovation schools met as part of the workshops last week and they were continuing on that work now this term to keep making sure that what they were doing was something that schools could actually realise practically .
Kirsty Williams AM said that children 's rights , human rights had been key considerations throughout the design and this was currently set out in overarching guidance and they continued to work with the children 's commissioner 's office to map the rights of the child across each area of learning and experience . Kirsty Williams AM also explained that they undertook a specific programme of engagement with children and young people , including focus groups of young children and feedback from focus groups of young children . The output of that engagement and feedback has been drawn together into a report exploring learners ' views about schools and learning . It was a powerful contribution and Kirsty Williams AM thought it would actually effect change , especially in how the 'what matters ' statements were worded .
Kirsty Williams AM said that they were already having those conversations with Qualifications Wales and there was a piece of work that was ongoing to look at what were the resources that were necessary to support the curriculum . And this proposal by the Learned Society would be considered as part of that work .
Kirsty Williams AM firstly talked about the Welsh dimension , and it was important that whatever resources they had to support the Welsh dimension were broad and not confined to specific areas . Then , the continuum for language would have to be contextualised depending on the setting where a child was being taught . There would be progression points on that continuum that would be there to show progression both in Welsh language and in the English language , and they would have to be contextualised .
The meeting began with a brief discussion of the Aurora HTK baseline system and the Mel scale . The team was concerned that the Aurora system had a hundred-hertz high-pass , while the SRI system had a hundred-hertz high-pass . The team also discussed the possibility of weighting the spectrum on the ball spectrum . The team also discussed the possibility of adding a noise-reduction filter to the Mel scale . The team then discussed the possibility of adding a noise-reduction filter to the Mel scale . The team also discussed the possibility of adding a noise-reduction filter to the Mel scale .
The team discussed the effect of the neural net on the HM case and the number of deletions . The team thought that the deletions were increasing , but the professor thought that the model was doing well . The team thought that the model was paying attention to the neural net features .
The professor thought that the neural net was not helping at all until the team put the second path in with the pure features . He thought that the net was doing similar things as before , but it was doing a little bit worse . He thought that the net was doing a little bit better than the features , but it was still not great . He thought that the net was doing a little bit better than the features , but it was still not great .
The team thought that the noise subtraction was subtracting off speech . The professor thought that the results were a little bit worse . The professor thought that the neural net was helping , even if the features were bad .
The team was using a VAD neural network that was based on the same approach as the previous one . The team was using MFCC after noise compensation and a LDA filter . The team was getting good results , but the latency was still too large . The team was concerned that the VAD was not doing enough to clean up the noise .
The professor thought that the latency of the VAD was two hundred and twenty milliseconds . He thought that the VAD was used before the delta computation , which was done afterwards . The professor thought that the VAD was used for on-line normalization , and it was used before the delta computation . The professor thought that the VAD was used for the noise probabilities , which were 40 milliseconds for the cleaning of the speech . The professor thought that the VAD was used for the smoothing .
PhD C explained that the latency was caused by filtering of silence probabilities and LDA filters . The delta at the input was one hundred milliseconds for smoothing . The median was forty plus forty for the cleaning of the speech and forty for the ANN .
The meeting began with a discussion about the wireless headset , which was abandoned in favor of a more convenient and convenient mike . The professor explained that the team had decided to abandon the lapel because it was not a good choice because it was too far away from the microphone , and the lapel was in the middle . The team also discussed the plan for using the SUN Blade , a compute farm that was being built for the project , and the progress of the project individually . The meeting ended with a discussion about the progress of the project and the plans for the summer .
The professor explained that the lapel was abandoned because it was too far away from the microphone , which meant that the microphone was not so close that it could get rid of all the interference . On the other hand , the lapel was a good choice because it was in the middle , which was where the microphone was .
PhD F explained that the team had just put in an order for twelve new machines to use as a compute farm . The team was using P- make and Customs , which was running on SUN Blade . The team was using the SRI recognizer , which had all the P- make customs stuff built into it . PhD F also explained that the team was running two parallelization jobs simultaneously .
The professor explained that the workshop was about the rough division of the network . He explained that the team was using all the machines and the professor was using all the machines . He also explained that the team should not run more than ten jobs at a time .
The team discussed the pros and cons of spectral subtraction and how it could be combined with Wiener filtering and signal subspace . The professor thought that the Wiener filter was better than spectral subtraction , but the team thought that the former was more convenient . The team also discussed whether it was better to do it on the FFT bins or on mel warped .
The team thought that the team could work with someone in Grenada who had implemented VTS techniques . The team also knew that the VTS was proposed by CMU .
The professor thought that the Wiener filter was not very effective in dealing with poor SNR conditions . He thought that the advantage of combining two things was mainly coming from the signal subspace approach , which had an in-built Wiener filtering in it .
The meeting started with the presentation of the prototype of the product by User Interface and Industrial Designer . User Interface introduced the prototype of the product as a product made by clay with a basic colour of yellow and red and a shape of a triangle . Industrial Designer introduced the product as a product made by genetically modified mushroom with a unique design and a fuzzy design . Marketing introduced the product as a product with a circle and a triangle shape and a button to select the channel . Project Manager then introduced the price of the product and the production cost .
The product was made by clay and the basic colour was yellow and red . The shape was a circle and a triangle . The prototype was made of clay and the shape was a mushroom . The team thought that the product was a unique design and fuzzy . The team thought that the product was a vegetable and could be integrated with the fruit aspect .
User Interface explained that the basic colour of the product should be yellow and red because yellow was the company colour and red was more attractive . The shape of the product was a circle and a triangle piece , which was a mushroom shape .
The user interface designer introduced the product as a mushroom design , which was a fuzzy design and a unique design . The marketing thought that the product was not in the trends because there were fruits and vegetables and the product was a vegetable . The marketing thought that the product was not eatable and it was not integrated with different colour .
Marketing introduced three key points to evaluate the product , which were fancy look and feel , colour and shape . Industrial Designer thought the remote control had a bowl shape and was unique , while User Interface thought it had a fancy look and feel . Project Manager thought the remote control looked like a pineapple and the shape was unique , but Marketing thought it was not fancy enough . Marketing also thought the lemon aspect of the remote control was not obvious . Project Manager thought the remote control looked like a lemon and the microphone was embedded in the remote control .
Marketing thought the design was technologically innovative because it was easy to use and the microphone was embedded . User Interface thought the microphone could capture voice from different directions and the group agreed that the remote control could be technologically innovative because it could recognise simple vocal comments .
The marketing thought that the vocal command was easy to use , but the industrial designer thought it was difficult to use . The user interface designer thought it was easy to change channels by turning the remote control , but the marketing thought it depended on the angle of the remote control . The marketing also thought it was difficult to jump from one to twenty channels .
The industrial designer first introduced the prototype of the remote control , which was a low level chip with the LCD button and the battery battery inside . The team then discussed the cost of the remote control and the solar cell . The team agreed to have a twelve and a half Euros remote control that would cost not more than twelve and a half Euros . The team then discussed the cost of the remote control and the prototype . The team agreed to have a wooden remote control and a solar cell .
The group decided to keep the solar cells because they were the most expensive part of the industrial design . The marketing team would be able to make a lot of advertisement concerning the solar cells to sell it . The group thought that the product would be technologically innovative and easy to use .
The industrial designer thought that it was good to follow the flow of the trends and make the product now and after , so that if the people change their mind , the product would change also . The marketing thought that the product would not last for long , so he suggested that they could make a line of T-V with a line of cell phones .
