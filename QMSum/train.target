Project Manager initiated the final meeting on the topic of detailed design . Industrial Designer and User Interface each gave a presentation on the prototype and discussed the evaluation criteria , especially that of microphone and buttons . Next , the group did calculations on the budget as well as the profit goal before Marketing showed the challenges of this project in terms of budget control and reaching the profit target . The group then discussed using the internet for promotion and ordering and drop-shipping the product to the customer 's residence . Finally , the subject moved to product evaluation by putting the prototype on the market and analyzing the feedback . The group discussed whether they should spare time for the redesign process before releasing the product to the market . Then Industrial Designer put up a strategy to do effective user research by choosing sports seasons .
User Interface presented the function , customizability and appearance ( colour , material and shape ) of the remote control . Then the group discussed the location of the microphone as well as the weight and shape of the buttons . Project Manager suggested that the microphone should be under the flip while User Interface argued that it should be on the side . User Interface also proposed that the buttons should be made in egg shape and of plasticine .
User Interface suggested that the prototype of the remote control would have an ergonomic shape , be made out of wood and the colour would be customisable . User Interface also introduced the general layout of the white board under the flip : the big yellow button would be charged for turning the TV on and off , the red triangle one would be used to change the volume , while the green one controlled the channel changing . There would be a dark blue numeric pad at the bottom and an LCD screen on the flip panel . The prototype would have a customised backing and front .
Industrial Designer proposed to specify the location of the microphone . Project Manager and User Interface disagreed with each other . Project Manager thought the microphone should be under the flip so that users could easily turn off the voice recognition , whereas User Interface insisted that microphone should be on the side so that the remote control could be activated by voice even when out of reach .
Industrial Designer proposed to conduct a product evaluation by putting the prototype on the market to get feedback from the users . User Interface pointed out that there should be time for redesign while Project Manager insisted that no more change would be made on the original design and improvements made according to evaluation results would be on the second generation . What 's more , Industrial Designer came up with a strategy to do additional user research by choosing the sports season and working with motion pictures .
Because User Interface thought there should be a turnaround time between product evaluation and its formal release . User Interface believed that many products had been released to the market without being properly user-tested and did n't receive positive results , so the remote control should be minimally tested before redesigned and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements according to the feedback from product evaluation .
Industrial Designer proposed to choose a special time of year which is most important for the TV remote control sales to launch the product for user testing . Project Manager suggested the sports season which was right before the World Cup football and to work with motion pictures coming out on DVD that the users needed to have a special remote control to work with . The group intended to set up a campaign with picture companies .
The meeting began with the professor discussing the technical features of their recordings . The interaction between the hardware and the model had to be mediated through different techniques . Some members on the team were working on low-pass down-sampling as a replacement for LDA filters . Low-pass seemed to perform better , but the team was uncertain about its robustness . The professor thought that the team should submit something to Eurospeech and that they should further study reverberation . The professor thought that studying spectrograms would be a good place to start . The team then discussed VAD and line mean normalization as techniques for getting rid of noise . The meeting ended with a brief discussion on feature detection .
The professor noted that a major component in one of the waves was the air conditioner . The team had to be more cognizant about these kind reverberations in the recordings . After a threshold , the reverberations interfered with the recordings . The team thought they could look at spectral slices to further understand the problem .
The professor informed the team that noise was affecting their recordings but Dan had assured him that the quantization effect was not significant . He thought that the team should update their web page to better reflect their understanding of the topic .
PhD B thought that a smaller capacitor might help with reverberation . PhD B was also interested in the cutoff frequency to ensure that reverberation does not interfere with speech too much . PhD B thought it was around 20 .
Eurospeech was taking place in Denmark and the team was planning on submitting a paper to it . The team was also discussing how to best present the reverberation problem . The team thought that the spectral effects of the reverberation were very clear . They would have to figure out how to remove the sources of variance from the data to capture only the main voice .
PhD F explained that they were trying to do something with meeting recorder digits for Eurospeech . Some people on OGI were working on a paper due on the 13th of May .
PhD F informed the group that the preliminary results from spectral subtraction were very bad . Mean normalization brought noise to around zero . Mean and variance normalization helped with speech but not with noise variance .
This was the Children , Young People and Education committee , guided by Lynne Neagle . The whole meeting was in the quiz form , in which Carol Shillabeer , the chief executive of Powys Teaching Health Board , answered questions about the Together for Children and Young People programme . To begin with , Shillabeer responded to the progress and shortages of the whole programme , followed by the theme of early help and enhanced support for children and young people . The next topic was the CAMHS framework and its effect in promoting a consistent delivery of care . Furthermore , Shillabeer answered questions about neurodevelopmental services , in-patient care , the workforce issue , looked-after children , and transitional arrangement . In the end , Shillabeer indicated the personal position of legacy that there would be something to handle those problems , no matter what it was .
The Mental Health Measure 's target had increased significantly among the UK . The programme well met the demand with more contacts , more staff , and shorter access times , but it still did not completely sustain at that stage . As for intervention resources , there had been good attempts to help . As for the stakeholder workshop , it was successful support on early help and enhanced support . Finally , as for the legacy arrangements , CAMHS element would move to CAMHS network , part of the NHS mental health network .
The specialist CAMHS element would move to the CAMHS network . The whole-school approach had already been settled in the Government while the programme had constructed a relative connection .
The workshop brought all the agencies together , along with their demands and interests . Furthermore , there was a planning group reflection for the next stage to which three commitments had been made . First , values-led approaches were to be developed to bring multiple agencies together to have a common purpose . The second was to develop ingredients for successful working . The third was to determine the priorities of the next step .
In terms of an increase in neurodevelopmental referrals , Hefin David wanted to know its reasons and measures . Carol Shillabeer responded with no specific idea for the reasons and an introduction of delivery progression for the measures . Being asked , Carol then talked about a broader view of group work , mentioning the limitation of threshold and focused conditions .
Carol Shillabeer introduced Dr. Cath Norton and his group which had a standing start in addressing neurodevelopmental issues under the programme . There had been seven teams across Wales , a national pathway , and a community-of-practice-type environment .
There would be only 40 per cent to 50 per cent of families met a threshold for the support , while more people still needed help . Therefore , focusing on the families who reached a threshold is not good enough , and the programme should tackle all of them .
Carol Shillabeer answered Lynne Neagle 's question by introducing the progress of the in-patient care programme and the challenge of the workforce . Carol personally recommended employing more psychology assistants as part of a skill mix team and indicated communities of practice to make the best use of the resource . Finally , as for the language , there was an agreement on the use of the Welsh language and the need for enough Welsh language practitioners to respond to vulnerable people .
The most important at that time was the long-term work between health and social care in terms of having a much more integrated and joined-up approach for children .
The practice was guided by the Nation Institute for Health and Care , enabling referrals to match the right practitioner and the right service . It is expected to be more flexible and careful to use the resource . Overall , the community had gradually become standard , doing a collective reflection on service improvement and being clear about mutual learning , but the environment operated still waited to be improved .
Carol Shillabeer answered a question from Suzy Davies , indicating the intersection between the Together for Children and Young People programme and the Outcomes for Children Group programme . Next , in response to Dawn Bowden , Shillabeer talked about the development of transition guidance and the endeavor to reduce the numbers of transitions and manage them better .
First , there was a close link between each member . Second , in terms of the question of specialist CAMHS in-patients , there was a need to bring the services together for stronger working .
The guidance was developed and the programme was in the process of evaluation . However , there was still further work to do in terms of audit , making sure to get a systematic approach to deal with those who had n't had the guidance fully implemented .
This meeting was about the conceptual design of the remote control . Firstly , Marketing presented on the market trend and suggested a remote control with a fancy look and feel , technology innovation , and spongy material . Next , User Interface presented on conceptual design and recommended the control itself should use an inconsistent colour scheme . Then , Industrial Designer presented on the component design and that the cost , the complexity , and the size would have an impact on their remote design and reminded there would be a restriction on grouping plastic and rubber cases together . Lastly , the group discussed remote concepts and decided to have a small size remote with the speaker , the chip on print for the power , and a rubber case .
Marketing presented on market trends and suggested strategies including innovation in a fancy look and feel of the remote control , the European fashion theme in fruit and vegetable shapes as well as a soft and spongy material trend .
Marketing mentioned that market research emphasized technology innovation which was the ease of use in the functionality . So Marketing suggested when they focused on the trend of fruit and vegetable themes , they should know how to fit in with something which was not specifically electronics and how to quickly create a remote in fruit shape .
Because Marketing recommended the group took some features of Mac or iPod and made it a more comfortable type when associating people in terms of texture , shape , and colours . Marketing also suggested they could incorporate gimmicky features that buttons would light up when touching the button .
The group discussed the final remote concepts after three presentations . Therefore , they decided to have a small-sized remote with the speaker , the power with the chip on print , a transparent case , and rubber incorporated into the case . However , they would not go for an LCD partly because they needed an input device instead of output and the cost would be added .
When discussing the LCD functionality , the group found that it was not necessary to have it because they had the speaker and no need for a talk-back for the remote . Also , the LCD tended to be output as opposed to an input and it would be added to the cost of the remote , so the group agreed not to go for an LCD .
Project Manager gave the team members a brief introduction of the new remote control project , then the team started an ice breaking game by drawing their favourite animals . The expected selling price of the remote control is 25 Euros and the production costs would be limited to twelve and a half Euro per unit . Marketing plan would depend on overhead costs . The team agreed that the remote needs to be robust , and they wanted it to be a device for all with accessible buttons . Project Manager suggested it to be only a television remote control instead of a multi-functional one .
The team agreed that the device needed to be robust so that it would n't get damaged easily . As for the features , the team believed that fewer buttons on the remote control would make it easier to use . Besides , a combined remote was favoured , as it can be a device for more than one remote . However , the team believed that the two features are mutually exclusive .
Industrial Designer thought that a remote with more accessible buttons can make it easier to use , as some of the buttons of the remote he used were too small to press . He also suggested that the remote needs to be robust , so that it would not be damaged easily .
He suggested that they could develop a remote control which moves around the room , so that the customer does not need to get up to pick up the remote in the other room . However , he also made clear that it is only an idea for the future .
Marketing suggested that they could develop the remote control into a hand held mini laptop , so that it could control all sorts of appliances . But at the end of the meeting , they made the decision that the new remote control would not be a multi-functional one , and it would only be designed for television .
Marketing suggested that they could devise a new system for the remote control , and make the remote into a miniature laptop . The reason for the occurrence of the idea is that there are already many kinds of cutting-edge remote controls in the market , and the multi-functional remote could control all sorts of appliances in the house .
Industrial Designer thought that they should stick to the idea of traditional television remote control , instead of a multi-functional one .
Firstly , Industrial Designer introduced both the cheap one and the other , the expensive prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its function . Both the devices had the special shape , like the surf-board . The first prototype was a pretty simple design with LCD display and a conventional layout of buttons . The second prototype was advanced in its speech recognition function and looked like a fashion mobile phone . Secondly , Marketing designed an evaluation test , focusing on its look and feel , innovation and ease of use and the team were asked to give one to seven points to each feature of the product to compare the two prototypes . Thirdly , the team calculated the cost of both the prototypes and found that the second one had exceeded the budget to a great extent . As a result they discussed and voted a lot to discard the advanced functions and eliminate the number of the push buttons , which made the budget under control .
Both the devices had the special shape , like the surf-board . The first prototype was a pretty simple design with LCD display and an on-off button in red . It was easy to use and could only be used for the TV mode . After all , the team concluded that it was a standard design except for its special shape that made it look adorable . On the contrary , the second prototype was advanced in its speech recognition function and looked like a fashion mobile phone . It came with six key buttons and one orange one for the microphone . If the user would like a speech recognition and a lot of information on the channel could be displayed directly on LCD display . Also , the components for the two designs were low in weight and there was LED to indicate the battery usage , making it convenient to use . To conclude , Marketing fancied the second one 's size and shape .
Marketing recalled what the team had identified as being important to sell the product for both the devices and made a list of features from the marketing point of view . For both of the prototypes , Marketing asked the team to give one to seven points to each feature of the product and the lower the points the better the feature . For instance , look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components that Marketing wanted the team to discuss about . This might help with the conclusion whether the product was appealing to the correct demographic and incorporated the fashion trend into it .
The team agreed that although the cover was movable , the case design was moderate . Also , the way the device could be held was not attractive and easy for all , since the left-handed people would choose to use it with the other hand , which made it really annoying . When it came to innovation , Industrial Designer believed basically there was no innovation in the first one compared to what existed in the market . However , the second design was extremely innovative as it had incorporated all the scrolling buttons and its automatic speech recognition function . Besides , the two products aimed at the target customers well , with the first standard one for the old group while the second one for those between twenty to forty five . Lastly , the team concluded that they had successfully answered the company 's philosophy of having the fashion in electronics .
The first design obviously met the requirements of the budget so the team focused on the second one to see whether the combination of the two designs could together form an innovative design but was under the budget at the same time . To cut costs , the Project Manager first suggested using normal chips only in exchange for the speech recognition function . The special color was left to the case and it was designed as curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well . Later , the team had argued a lot whether to eliminate the number of buttons or to discard LCD displays . However , if the number of buttons were to be eliminated , it would be far more complicated to use the device , since users must press one button several times to get to the channel . After a vote and discussion about the cost , the team decided to discard both the LCD display and the speech recognition functions since they were really expensive and the later one could not work without the existence of the former one .
This is the third meeting of the design group . Project Manager raised the question left over from the last meeting . That is , what kind of energy source should be used . Industrial Designer preferred a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery , but Project Manager rejected and decided to use a long-term battery in light of the production cost . Then Industrial Designer described the advantages and disadvantages of custom-designed chips and chips off the shelf . Due to the significance of technological innovation , the team decided to choose the former . After discussion , the team agreed that they needed buttons for channel change , power , menu and volume , and proposed to add a slide button . In terms of the appearance design , Marketing proposed to follow the fashion and use a spongy material . In order to keep up with the changes in fashion , the team recommended interchangeable covers .
Industrial Designer proposed to select a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery , but Project Manager rejected and preferred a conventional one . In terms of the choice of chips , Industrial Designer pointed out that custom-designed ones were more flexible but would cost more and take a long time , so Project Manager favoured chips off the shelf . However , in view of the significance of technological innovation , the team eventually chose custom-designed ones .
Project Manager learned that custom-designed chips would be expensive and the completion time could not be predicted as the voice technology had not been well developed yet .
Industrial Designer pointed out that voice technology was fundamental to the project and Marketing also revealed the importance of technological innovation .
User Interface proposed that to avoid excessive buttons , a slide button could be used and envisaged that the push button could be added when changing the function of the slider . Project Manager agreed and supposed that three buttons could be put on a slider . Eventually , the team achieved an agreement that they need buttons for channel change , power , menu and volume .
Project Manager thought push buttons were simpler , cheaper and more reliable and initially had doubts about slide buttons . But when User Interface revealed that slide buttons actually cost the same as push buttons , Project Manager agreed to the idea and supposed that three buttons could be installed on a slide button to save space .
The team initially supposed that the buttons for channel change , power and volume were needed . But then , they came to realize that people might need to change brightness , tint and stuff so they thought a menu button was also needed .
This meeting took up the discussion from the last one . They specified the ideas brought up last time and adapted them according to the market potentials and budget limits . Marketing first reported their findings of market potentials . Altogether , they summarized four conclusions : ( 1 ) consumers were willing to spend more for fancy products ( 2 ) the current products did n't always match users ' operating behaviours ( 3 ) a lot of buttons were n't used ( 4 ) they were not fun to use . Then , the team came up with a novel feature of automatic speech recognition to retrieve the remotes . In the latter half of the meeting , the team decided that the following functions would be for the new remotes : speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design , programmability , glowing in dark , and integrating the logo and slogan .
According to Marketing , seventy-five percent of the users found the remote controls which were available now in the market were ugly . Eighty percent of the users reported having the willingness to pay high for good-looking remote controls . Thirty-four percent of the consumers considered their remote controls were too difficult to operate . What 's more , some companies believed that they shall have more functions in their remote controls . However , rather than having more functions and making it complicated , they shall emphasize what actually customers wanted and what they operated . All of these market potentials were required to be taken into consideration in order to enhance profits and sales .
On the whole , the results of the market potentials helped the team know the status quo and form some general ideas about the functions required by the market . First of all , the team realized the requirement for beautiful products , thus aiming to design good-looking and appropriate TV remote controls in order to enhance the sales . Second , since about one-third of the consumers reported to have difficulties in using their remotes , the team then agreed to reduce the numbers of buttons . Lastly , they decided to add speech recognition to their products because people from fifteen to thirty ( the age group contained most of the consumers ) enjoyed this function very much .
Altogether , there were three advantages . The first was the simplicity of use . In the market , lots of remotes had many buttons because companies believed that more buttons they added , the more their consumers would appreciate . However , the fact was that many people did n't know how to use these buttons at all . The redundant buttons only increased the difficulties for people to use . The second was the decrease in cost since fewer buttons were needed . The last was the increase in sales and profits .
After a thorough discussion , the team finally reached a consensus that the new design would have seven functions . First , the new remotes would dis-include teletext because that was obsolete . Second , they wanted to integrate the corporate colour and slogan in the new design . Third , speech recognition would be included . Fourth , the new remotes could glow in the dark . Fifth , there would be limited buttons on the remotes . Sixth , the design was organic . Seventh , the new remotes would be with programmability .
Although there were two options : a light inside the remotes and glow in the dark material , the team finally agreed to choose the later one because it was much cheaper . Besides , it was believed that combined with speech recognition , it would be easy for people to locate their remote controls , thus enhancing the overall market sales .
According to the Project Manager , it was hard to have speech recognition in remotes and no products in the market now used this function well . There was mainly one reason : the noise interference problem , which was too expensive to solve . Luckily , the User Interface came up with an idea to have something built into the TV that people could press and then it would send out a little signal . The Industrial Designer agreed and proposed to have a microphone by the TV speaker and a transmitter there to send back to their remotes . Such design was subtractive cancellation of the noise .
The group talked about the ongoing transcription effort and issues related to the Transcriber tool , which despite its limitations for capturing tight time markings for overlapping speech , will continue to remain in use . Speaker mn014 explained his efforts to pre-segment the signal into speech and non-speech portions for facilitating transcriptions . Recording equipment and procedures were discussed , with a focus on audible breathing and the need for standards in microphone wear and use .
Speaker C ’ s efforts to detect speech/non-speech portions in the mixed signal ( using an HMM-based detector with Gaussian mixtures ) have produced pre-segmentations that facilitate the transcription effort .
Speaker mn014 trained the system to identify speech from loud versus quiet speakers . Such pre-segmentation modifications allow the experimenter to specify the minimum length of speech and silence portions desired , and also facilitate the identification of pauses and utterance boundaries .
There is no channel identifier to help in encoding speaker overlaps . Speech uttered while laughing is problematic for ASR . So far , speaker mn005 's attempts to detect speaker overlap have been unsuccessful , as it has not been possible to normalize energy as a reliable indicator of overlap .
The transcriber pool is making quick progress , and may be used in the future to perform other types of coding , e.g . a more detailed analysis of speaker overlap . Transcribers are coding non-speech gestures , such as audible breaths and laughter , both of which are useful for improving recognition results .
Recent modifications to the Transcriber tool allow transcribers to listen to speech from different channels , as well as helping to preserve portions of overlapping speech , and enabling the creation of different output files for each channel for a cleaner and more segmentable transcript .
The Praat software package was discussed as an alternative transcription tool capable of representing multiple channels of speech . Cross-correlation was discussed as a means of enabling speaker identification , and may be integrated into future work .
The meeting began with an update on the voice-unvoice detection . The professor suggested the solution might just be feeding the log magnitude of the spectrum into a simple neural net . The team then had a brief discussion about some confusing formula on the France Telecom proposal . Following this , the team talked about how to pick out the most important acoustic events . Then , Grad A introduced the team to phonological matchings that he was working on using Support Vector Machines . The goal was to map MFCC 's to phonological features . The team concluded by discussing a potential bug which led to a significant difference between PLP and mel cepstrum and the FFT method that they were exploring .
The existing net for voice-unvoice had three outputs , voice , unvoice , and silence . It took fifteen features as inputs . The team discussed how energy measures could be incorporated to improve performance on this task . The nets took around a day to train , so the team could run more experiments . The current performance on the task was unsatisfactory .
The professor explained that the task typically relied on R-one over R-zero as a measure . He thought that the team should explore the difference between the log FFT and the log magnitude FF spectrum and the filter bank . These were fundamentally different measures which could help the model .
PhD D explained that voice-unvoice net took fifteen base features and three features of R as inputs . The R features were the variance of the difference between the two spectrums , variance of the auto-correlation function , and the first coefficient of the auto-correlation function . This method , however , was not that much better than the more typical method that the professor recalled .
Support vector machines were better at dealing with a lower amount of data , so they could do a reasonable job learning patterns in MFCC without too much work . They worked by finding an optimal separating plane . This was more efficient as the model picked only critical points as opposed to doing more computationally expensive k-means clustering .
The professor recalled that people at Mississippi state were using support vector machines for speech recognition by estimating probabilities . The results were not significant , but they were reasonable .
Grad A explained that his vector contained binary values for whether a phonological feature exists or not . The goal was to come up with a mapping from a feature set to the existence of a particular phonological feature . He was not doing the mapping yet . The goal was simply detecting features at the time .
Basically , the Children , Young People and Education Committee 's meeting was about the inquiry on school improvement and raising standards . In this meeting , the Minister for Education , Kirsty and Director of Education , Steve answered many specific questions and expressed their opinions about the current situations . Altogether , they had talked about the school categorization system which has been used right now , the curriculum reform , changes and challenges . Also , they spent lots of time discussing regional consortia services that the way it worked and how they could be improved . Although now they failed to persuade the government to adopt the new model , they were optimistic about the future application .
According to Kirsty , there were a variety of ways in which schools that needed support or needed to be challenged on their practice would be identified . Basically , they relied on the school categorization system . What 's more , in Kirsty 's opinion , the school improvement service was a risk-based approach . Luckily , the categorization system on which they depended would continue to evolve to align itself to the curriculum reform and make changes in self-evaluation . It would continue to evolve because it had to be consistent with their overall approach to school improvement and raising standards . What they needed now was a more strategic , longer term approach to reach changes in a school rather than some of the easy-to-fix items that made a school as if it was doing better .
Now , Estyn was used as part of the accountability system . Since the systems were evolving all the time , the Estyn itself inspection regime was changing as well . Now , they were moving to a system where Estyn would be more regularly in schools . Although there were two systems , they were different and they looked at different things . The categorization system they used now was how they looked for those ways of identifying support for schools .
According to Kirsty and Huw , the real question was how was it that they did n't identify those schools . Since these schools were not being identified early enough , there was a need to do something urgently about these concerns , particularly in secondary schools . Even though they had identified them as needing that extra help , they were not moving at pace away from that system . In Steve 's opinion , the importance lied on `` What about the schools that are sliding in that direction ? '' And it brought together what they knew from Estyn , but also , local authorities had knowledge of their schools , and so did consortia . They had got to be better at bringing those together .
According to Kirsty , school was going to need a little bit of extra support , so it was not always just a crisis that needed extra support . There were just general things that happen in the life of a school that could lead to it . However , it was also right that they had a particular challenge in the secondary sector . That 's why they had introduced the new pilot to address those schools . If they carried on doing the same thing , they would keep getting the same results , which was not satisfying enough .
According to Hefin , some regional consortia services performed really highly , but there were others that needed to improve . Those consortia shall be seen as working together on a national approach , but being delivered on a regional basis . Also , it had evolved over time , and they were constantly looking for optimum delivery . By taking Education through Regional Working as an example , they had pointed out that ERW as well as the Education Achievement Service EAS was constituted in a different way to the Central South Consortium . They delivered on a regional basis . They would continue to discuss with ERW what was the optimal way and continued to cooperate with the constituent local authorities about how that shall be organized .
In Hefin 's opinion , they took ERW as an example because it did things differently with regard to the four consortia . They were interested in the effectiveness of that organization to deliver for children and for teachers since ERW had got particular challenges . What they were seeing the national consortia do is developing a national approach to school improvement services . What 's more , according to Hefin , the regional consortia were not a beast of the Government ; they were a beast of the local authorities that had worked together to create a school improvement service that met their needs .
Kirsty believed that it was really important for them to understand how Neath Port Talbot intended to support their schools and their teachers if they were to withdraw from ERW , especially at what was a critical time . They wanted to know from Neath Port Talbot how they were going to do that without being part of the organization . Additionally , Kirsty was curious about how they were going to safeguard their schools and make sure that the children who were receiving their education in Neath Port Talbot were not disadvantaged if they were to follow through on that decision .
According to Kirsty , they would be `` seeking assurances '' . It meant that Neath Port Talbot would need to demonstrate to them how they were going to address these problems . However , so far , they had not seen the plans . But if Neath Port Talbot were to push forward and follow on the notice , they would want to see . Now , what they were doing was waiting for their responses .
According to Kirsty , it was the current model . Although they failed to persuade the local government to adopt a new national model , the local authorities had already seen the value in it . However , they were at the stage looking to a wholesale review of the national model . Now they were all focusing on the work of implementation . At the same time , they had the risk of losing focus because of the emphasis on the curriculum and other aspects of the educational system .
Now the group was engaging with Steve and other officials on agreeing a plan , but also , that plan was there to support the successful implementation of the curriculum . Based on the words from Kirsty , they were very clear about the roles and responsibilities in the middle tier in this phrase following the publication . Now they had moved into a relentless focus on implementation . Basically , everything now was an emphasis on successful implementation .
Steve believed that it was set up to build collective efficacy because what people out there were seeing was a confusion of roles in what the regions were doing , and it was building that collective efficacy so everyone was behind the wheel . They would have collective effort , but they needed to do more within the middle tier .
In Kirsty 's opinion , it appeared that it was placing a focus on the curriculum and other aspects of the educational system . However , there was not a risk from them to lose focus . Absolutely , it was about making sure that there was no duplication , that people were not second-guessing each other 's work . There were clear demarcations about who does what in the system . Therefore , there was not a question of losing focus .
According to Kirsty , they were trying to develop a broader range of data and statistics that gave them a whole picture of the education performance , rather than narrowing down on one simple indicator that told only one aspect . They would use the Program for International Student Assessment , and any other external assessments that came through organizations like OECD . In addition , they believed that all the challenges and changes involved were made for the right reasons . What was crucial was that it was about more intelligent use of data and what was truly telling about the system .
It was true that the change did make it more challenging . But the changes were made for the right reasons . By taking the example of learning English literature , they had come to a conclusion that they were making those changes because they believed that they were in the best interest of children , and that had to trump ease of comparison .
The real question was not about communicating the data , but about challenging people on how the data should be used . The data was still available , but it was a challenge to them about how to use the data . Sometimes , how they presented data in the past was lulling some people into a false sense of security about the performance of the system . Therefore , it was about how they used the data . The focus shall be on the more intelligent use and interrogation of the data , and about truly what it was telling us about the system .
According to Kirsty , there was no contradiction at all . They were not in the business of trying to hide the data because it was absolutely in full transparency . It was about how the data was used rather than about hiding data or making that data not available . They needed to dig much , much deeper underneath the data .
This is the first of a series of meetings devoted to the design of a remote control , and it aims only at the proposition of general first ideas on the project . Project Manager started off the meeting by introducing the team and their plan for the project . The team got to know each other better by drawing out their favourite animals and justifying their choice . Project Manager then invited everyone to raise ideas about the remote . Their discussion included its multifunctional nature , ergonomic design and battery type , but there was no final decision on these matters . The work was split among the team members , as each took up the task of the working design , the technical functions design , or marketing .
Following the proposal of Project Manager , each of the four team members drew their favourite animals . Marketing drew fish , explaining that he/she liked their water-vascular system , habitat , and normally mild looks . Industrial Designer drew a cat for its independence and decisiveness . User Interface 's choice was a badger , alluding to Wind in the Willows and Brian 's books . Finally , Project Manager showed his giraffe , and talked about its uniqueness and individuality .
When both Marketing and Industrial Designer had admitted to being allergic to cats , Project Manager attempted to propose a situation where they actually were around one . After this proposal was decisively rejected by User Interface , Project Manager talked about his/her experience with a roommate , proving that one could be used to cats if they were around them for a long time . Yet Marketing and Industrial Designer insisted on the severity of their allergies .
The animal User Interface drew was a badger . When Project Manager demanded the reason for this unusual choice , User Interface first answered that it was because badgers were grumpy and nocturnal . Industrial Designer joked about whether this suggested that User Interface had the same characteristics . User Interface then explained that his/her favourable impression of the badger came from books like Wind in the Willow , where badgers were cooler animals than what people generally imagine them to be .
The aspects they mentioned were its compatibility , ergonomics , and the battery type it would use . Since the remote control was expected to be multifunctional , it must be compatible with all kinds of devices . This would also require a detailed instruction booklet for customers . The design of its look and curvature would also matter . Finally , the team agreed to keep the battery problem on hold .
Industrial Designer perceived that the single remote should be able to control every possible device , and this would be rather difficult to achieve . Industrial Designer thought that VHSs would be phased out shortly , but they should still take it into consideration for the time being . Industrial Designer drew the conclusion that they had to make sure it could cover all the variances in signals .
The team first hesitated between double A and triple A batteries . Double A 's would be more convenient for customers , since most people usually have this type around . However , triple A batteries would allow the remote to be thinner . Industrial Designer then proposed that they could also try a small lithium battery . With all these possible options , Project Manager decided that they should leave this question aside and move on with the meeting , as long as they kept the battery problem in mind .
The meeting was mainly about the exchange of the preliminary ideas about a new TV remote control project and subsequent task assignment . The project manager first set a target of making a fifty million Euros ' profit from the project , with the unit price of twenty-five Euros . Afterwards , the team raised different opinions about features of the new remote controls and related questions about market potential . Among all the features , having a good look and size was unanimously considered to be the most essential . In the end , Marketing was assigned to investigate market competition and design , and User Interface thinking about shapes , colours and other attributes which would attract customers .
The team came up with three general desired features about their new TV remote controls . First , it should be universal ( which was the one for all type things ) . Second , the remote controls were required to be slim . Most importantly , it should be different from the rest in the market , suggesting that the new remote controls would be with some kinds of a gimmick , such as whistling for retrieval .
There were two reasons . The first was that the unit price of each remote control was relatively high ( twenty-five Euros ) . Therefore , in order to increase customers ' willingness to spend so much money on one single remote control , the features must be satisfying and good enough . The second was the competition since there were other TV remote controls in the market . The new TV remote controls shall be special and different from the rest so as to attract customers .
Basically , they summarized from their daily experience . The project manager pointed out the User Interface only bought the sort of one for all type things . Also , the User Interface and project manager both agreed that a little gimmick was able to make a difference . For example , you could whistle to retrieve lost items .
In the discussion , the team agreed that the good look and size were two vital features of the new TV remote controls . Unfortunately , the team failed to reach a consensus in this meeting about the size , but they left it to the next meeting .
According to Marketing , people were more willing to play with a good-looking remote control when they were watching movies or playing electronic devices . The rest of the team approved of this idea since people tended to have a good design in hand .
Industrial Designer pointed out that too many buttons would get the remote controls too big and clunky . However , a really small and slim one was very likely to be lost . The User Interface then proposed a PDA or hand-held kind of remote controls . Unfortunately , it was not friendly to the unit price .
This is the second meet-up for the new product of television remote control , with a particular focus on its functional design . Industrial Designer , Marketing and User Interface were each invited to give a presentation on the subject that they are in charge of . On the basis of conducted user requirement survey , Industrial Designer and User Interface put forward their ideas on remote control features which are new to the existing market , along with the functionality and outlook of the product . Among all the features , speech recognition command takes up the majority of discussed subjects . The group also discussed the material appropriate to use in the construction . After the group determined the financial target of this project , as well as the production price and reasonable selling price , Marketing suggested taking a risk in price rise .
The group decided that the feature of speech recognition should be included to the remote control , even though it would exceed the cost constraint set by the management . Marketing believed that it is worth taking a risk because speech recognition is new to the market and customers would be willing to pay extra for this trendy function . What 's more , Project Manager agreed to coordinate with some technical companies if Industrial Designer ever needed any technological backup .
Marketing believed this feature would improve the market competitiveness of this product based on a conducted survey on user requirement . One the one hand , 80 % of the 15-35 year-old group are willing to spend more money for trendy new products . 75 % - 90 % of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote even though it is of higher price . On the other hand , half of the users said the remote control got lost easily and most of the time were hard to find . With speech recognition , however , this problem could be solved .
User Interface found this feature great , but he noticed that the ambient sound coming from television would confuse the speech recognition and might accidentally trigger the remote control . User Interface pointed out that Industrial Designer had to make sure the speech recognizer would be good enough to filter out the television speech and recognize only the user 's voice . He believed that this feature , once successfully achieved , would make the product popular on the market .
Industrial Designer suggested that the remote control needed to be able to turn the television on and off , control the volume and the menu , change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . As for the material used for the construction of the outer case , it needed to be not only flexible and inflatable , but also waterproof . The product itself would be better if it could change in size depending on user preference . In addition , the remote control should be able to respond to the user by sending out an oral cue in order to show that it understood your message correctly .
Based on user perspective feedback , User Interface pointed out that the buttons on remote controls are generally too many and too small . Even though they were sometimes labeled , it was still not clear for the users to tell what each button was supposed to do . Given this , User Interface preferred to keep the number of buttons to a minimum and make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed . He believed a simpler design would make the product less imposing .
Given the fact that for families with children , remote controls were always played or even thrown by kids , Project Manager would prefer the material used in the construction of the product , especially on the outside , to be unbreakable . Project Manager also suggested that the product should be slim and simple . On top of that , it would be better if the remote control could be universal to use for any kind of television .
The meeting contains discussions of the main focus on early childhood education and care programmes.The team were working with local authorities and healthboards to see how to work together and simplify the Welsh Government 's approach , looking forward to encouraging the development of the foundation phase in non-maintained settings . Addressing big differences in the amount of early childhood education in different parts of Wales , the team answered the needs of the families and the children in certain areas . Then the meeting discussed the demand-driven approach to the childcare market , asserting there was no evidence of cutting on the foundation . Then the team answered the question about the demand of Welsh language skills by obviously differing degrees and hiring workers of different backgrounds . When talking about the competition with existing formal childcare , the team believed it was expected . Then the team alleged they would do more investment and reviews on the programme , and discussed how to tackle the technical issues with HMRC . Next the extra cost was not yet defined , the price tag was announced to be £2.5million . Finally , the meeting discussed the necessity of adding eligibility checks to the beginning of the programme , and the details on the sample `` Flying Start '' programme .
Julie Morgan insisted that they were aware that different local authorities actually had adopted different patterns of providing early education . And with the Flying Start programme being geographically targeted , with the education being determined by the local authorities , they knew that there was a variance throughout Wales . Then they would like to see facilities developed in each local authority throughout Wales that would answer the needs of the families and the children in those areas . And It was demand-led and universally available to all parents who meet the eligibility criteria of working , so they believed the programme should be available to everybody .
The Welsh and UK Governments had followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market , with subsidies mainly given to working parents , which was a mistake and should be more universally available . The demand-driven approach was based more on certain factors : geographic spread in terms of it being more universal , and whether that 's the right way . It was hard for children to mix with peers from different backgrounds and age groups ? Next , some areas had traditionally got more childcare anyway because they had traditionally more demand in those areas , so there was not a level playing field to start from .
The team was aware that different local authorities actually had adopted different patterns of providing early education . And with the Flying Start programme being geographically targeted , with the education being determined by the local authorities , they knew that there was a variance throughout Wales . Next some of their care provision was universally available in certain areas . Then historically , that was definitely true , and they were certainly planning to expand it , developing a more integrated approach towards the early years . Finally they had got the system of inspection to ensure that .
Janet Finch-Saunders believed that the Welsh and UK Governments had followed a demand-driven approach to the childcare market , with subsidies mainly given to working parents , so there was not a level playing field to start from . However , Julie Morgan insisted that some of their provision was universally available in certain areas . Hence historically that was definitely true of the programme . Then they were certainly planning to expand the programme , which is believed to be a demand-led approach . Last they were managing it within the normal budgetary process , developing a more integrated approach towards the early years , and had got the system of inspection to ensure that .

Julie Morgan thought the demand was very important , and they were pleased that 29 per cent of children taking up the childcare offer were in Welsh or bilingual settings , so that they established a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in the childcare and played workforce with the National Centre for Learning Welsh to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector . But Suzy Davies thought that just on this early point , anybody who had been through the Welsh education system which is 20 years now , would have Welsh language skills obviously to differing degrees . Next , Nicola Edwards alleged that it was not necessarily appropriate for teaching language to children , because they might be coming from families who did n't use Welsh at home , but it is mainly about getting people to a point where they can transmit that language onwards in a confident and meaningful way .

Julie Morgan recommended to believe the demand was very important , and to establish a specific programme to develop Welsh language skills in childcare and played workforce with the National Centre for Learning Welsh to develop workplace Welsh language skills across the sector . And also she agreed on Nicola Edwards 's idea that they should have a stakeholder group where they had brought together a variety of people with an interest in the early years , childcare and play sectors .
Sian Gwenllian pointed out that the issues with HMRC had come to light that had made the team suspended the programme for the HMRC would have put limits on that . Julie Morgan answered that in terms of the Welsh language standards that the Minister had to use , there would be some difficulties in them doing it . For instance this would be delivered via HMRC with the English offer , which would cause difficulties for the Welsh offer . So , they wanted something more flexible . Nicola Edwards also agreed that the technical issues with HMRC for HMRC did provide a bilingual service at the moment for their customers in line with their Welsh language scheme . Jo-Anne Daniels finally came to the conclusion that they could deliver a cheaper system with flexibility that the Deputy Minister had referred to by working with local authorities rather than HMRC .

Jo-Anne Daniels finally came to the conclusion that they could deliver a cheaper system with flexibility that the Deputy Minister had referred to by working with local authorities rather than HMRC . At the moment , the extra cost would be about £2.5 million , which according to their initial estimate suggested that it would be less than the cost proposed by HMRC .
User Interface and Industrial Designer gave a presentation about the prototype of the remote control based on the team 's discussion in the previous meeting . Then the team evaluated the prototype against various criteria they formulated . After that , the team discussed adjusting the design of the remote in order to fit into the budget . Finally , the team evaluated the whole process of the project .
The evaluated the prototype against some criteria formulated in response to the market research and financial consideration . The team agreed that the features of fancy appearance and technical innovation were mutually exclusive . Besides , they all believed that their product incorporated elements of fashion to attract buyers and it fit in with their company 's other products . Then , the team discussed the budget of the product .
Industrial Designer thought it was fancy because the product had a single curve and the material of the rubber was fashionable at that time .
User Interface thought that the product incorporated elements of fashion to attract buyers because some of the buttons were shaped like cherry and it was spongy .
The team thought the creativity of the team was okay , as they felt that they got chances to express themselves well enough , but there were still some problems in their process of discussion . Then , Industrial Designer gave an example on how to improve the creativeness of the team . The team believed that their team work went well . As for the methods of discussion , Project manager thought that he was still not familiar with the operation of computers .
Project Manager thought that the team members showed their creativeness during the course of the meeting . But the flow of information on a given subject was sometimes disjointed .
User Interface thought that the team members ca n't all fairly comment on leadership because Project Manager is the leader , and the other member 's experience of leadership was n't as much as the Project Manager .
This is the fourth meeting . Project Manager began a detailed design meeting with Industrial Designer and User Interface 's overall design presentation . Industrial Designer and User Interface introduced the remote control was green with a light-blue screen of LCD , scroll and microphone function and the RR logo . Marketing put up a questionnaire so group members discussed and evaluated remote design . The final average score was two . Then the group calculated production cost . After calculation , the production cost was eighteen fifty and surpassed the company 's budget . So the design was changed and functions such as scroll and microphone were lost to satisfy the budget . The group evaluated the project and gave some suggestions about the whole process .
Based on the analysis of user requirements , the group evaluated remote control by answering questions on the questionnaire . The questions on the questionnaire were mainly about fancy design , innovation , simplicity , target people , shape , colour , material , function , logo , etc . The final average score for remote control design is two . Marketing thought it was a quite good score .
Marketing wondered if all the buttons were easy to find . User Interface thought most of the buttons were easy to find except options . Options were easy to find by touch . Meanwhile , Industrial Designer thought all the buttons were easier to find than a regular remote control . However , marketing insisted that options were not found that easy .
Industrial Designer thought this remote control was the most useful ever with regular and easy controls . In user Interface 's opinion , old people can use speech functions after reading manuals . With speech recognition , channels would be changed easily and elder 's questions would be answered . Project Manager agreed the speech function would make remote control easier to use , even for elders .
At first , the cost of remote control was eighteen and a half which highly surpassed the company 's budget . Group had to change the design and lose functions so that the budget could fill the company 's standard . Under this circumstance , the new design changed shape and lost functions such as scroll and microphone until the cost was twelve fifty . In addition , remote control changed to a single curve shape and battery without a solar cell made of rubber material .
Industrial Designer thought scroll wheel should be changed and the curve was not needed . Project Manager suggested dropping speech recognition for four euros cut . After a discussion about material , function , colour , chip , LCD and shape , the group decided to lose function as scroll wheel and microphone , change colour to only green and shape to single curve so that cost could be twelve fifty .
Project Manager suggested scrap speech recognition to cut four euros . User interface insisted that speech recognition was a special and new feature so it should n't be lost . However , compared to advanced chip and curve shape , the group decided to cut the speech recognition function .
The group had a heated discussion over the functional design and the market positioning of their new product . First , User Interface introduced the basic components of the remote control and the cost of them . When discussing the user interface design , the group agreed that the product should be good-looking and branded with their company logo . Industrial Designer thought they should keep the functions simple and basic and aimed at the exterior design . Then , the group talked much about the teletext and whether the controller should be only for TV . When it came to the market positioning , the opinion of User Interface differed from Marketing 's - the former tended to keep it simple but the latter thought there should be something special about the product to make it exclusive .
The basic components included power source , user interface , a programmable digital signal processor , on-off switch , encryption codes for the different modes of TVs , and memory system . Then User Interface presented the basic layout of how the remote would work . In terms of the cost , the most costly component was the chip and the casing would be expensive as well . LED , the transistors and everything else were pretty cheap . The price of the chip depended on what functionality the product would have and how much the battery capacity and storage would be . For the moment , they did n't have a ballpark figure .
The group agreed that the product should be good-looking and branded with their company logo . Industrial Designer thought they should keep the functions simple and basic and aimed at the exterior design . As for the teletext , Project Manager had intended to remove it from their new product , but considering the popularity of teletext , they decided to keep it since it would n't affect the price anyway . Besides , the product was demanded to be only for TV , but Marketing thought they should design an all-in-one ultimate remote control which would be easier to sell .
Marketing disapproved of this proposal because though teletext was becoming outdated as Project Manager said , more than eighty percent of the current televisions were still teletext and people were very comfortable with the idea of having and using teletext . Besides , Marketing could n't understand why the advent of the Internet would eliminate the need for teletext . Even so , if they were to remove the teletext from the controller , they had to bring something very attractive to take the place of it .
User Interface recommended to design a power cradle for the controller so that it would be unnecessary to change batteries . In this way , users would always know where the remote was because they had to put the device back to the cradle to charge it , which addressed the problem of losing it . This attempt would also do good to the look and feel of the remote control as a whole . The idea would be considered by the group , but they had to look into how much this might increase the cost .
The group decided to make the new product good-looking , durable and environmentally sensitive , but the opinion of User Interface had a little difference with Marketing 's - the former thought the product should only have some basic functions but the latter thought there should be something special about the product to make it exclusive .
User Interface believed that most people bought a new remote control just because they lost their old one and needed another one that could work with their TV . What they wanted was something ergonomic , durable , and good-looking . Actually , few people would use every function of the controller , so they should just keep the product simple instead of adding cost for advanced features .
Marketing wanted the product to be exclusive , beautiful , attractive , and environmentally sensitive . It should be special in some way so that it could sell on its own . Marketing also wanted to sell their corporate identity along with the product . However , the fact was that they could not use some cutting-edge technology due to the limitation of cost , so they had to aim at the exterior design .
It was a heated debate between the opposition party and the ministers . The members from the opposition parties first pointed out some flaws in the government 's current measures in hoping to better implement them . However , some of their suggestions were either not adopted or avoided . The opposition party also addressed their concerns towards fiscal pressure , employment market and production of personal protective equipment in the midst of the pandemic . The ministers listed a roll of policies that was either already in place or going to be . Finally , the opposition party named a few industries in Canada such as agriculture , tourism and fishing that were struck seriously by the pandemic . The ministers promised that more financial support was coming in order to engineer Canada 's economy .
The leader of the opposition party raised the point that some companies which had purchased other companies might not be eligible for the wage subsidy program , and money allocated for the wage subsidy was going unspent because the government had left in unnecessarily rigid barriers for companies to be able to access it . However , the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs argued that the wage subsidy program was supposed to reach out to as many companies as possible , and the wage subsidy was really put in place by a large amount of money to protect workers across Canada .
The leader of the opposition party wished to know that race-based or discriminatory police practices still exist across Canada . The minister reassured that there would not be such a thing in the police system . And also , the opposition party questioned about the inadequate long-term care facilities in Canada , and the minister stressed that the government saw it as a matter of utmost concern and urgency .
Members from the opposition party questioned that employers from industry , businesses and community organizations that have been approved in the Canada summer jobs program had not yet received the money they are entitled to . The Minister of Families , Children and Social Development answered that they were putting in strength to reinforce the program and allow it in reaching out to more unemployed students . Members from the opposition party raised their concern towards the weak job market due to the COVID-19 , but the Minister argued that they were still tackling obstacles to implement this policy in reality .
Since the government cancelled contracts with companies that were not able to meet Canadian standards , the member highlighted that it should be supporting more local companies for production . The minister answered that the government had been running multiple complementary supply chains at the same time , and were signing contracts with few more domestic companies . However , the opposition party was skeptical about those companies and other possible companies receiving sufficient funds for production .
The Minister of Canadian Heritage explained that the government remained committed to maintaining the openness and transparency during the crisis . However , the opposition party questioned about the allocation of $ 35 billion of infrastructure money . The opposition party suspected that the money went to personal salary and this doubt was not clarified enough during the later discussion .
According to the introduction of the opposition party , it has the power to introduce supply day motions and test government confidence . And the opposition party hoped that through this regime , Canada would take stronger diplomatic action on Hong Kong and gave more support for 300,000 Canadians living there . The Minister of Foreign Affairs promised that the Canada government would be continuing to raise voices to stand up for the people of Hong Kong .
The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food promised that under the circumstances , the government was doing its best to make the advance payments . Some of the delays were caused by staff having to work remotely . However , the opposition party suggested that there was policy change that made the eligibility for these loans more difficult during the middle of the pandemic . The minister explained that they were still constantly working with the administrators of the program .
The opposition party raised the problem that thousands of Canadian workers were exposed and vulnerable , and might experience bankruptcy anytime . The opposition party also stated that the changes the government made last year to bankruptcy insolvency laws were largely cosmetic and would not protect workers ' and pensioners ' livelihoods once bankruptcy hits . The Minister explained that they were continuing to absolutely ensure that pensions are protected .
The minister explained that the government was committed to advancing on the issues that have been identified by Canadians with disabilities and they were continuing that engagement . However , the opposition party argued that the support was delayed several times . The minister argued that they had done a lot , such as establishing the COVID-19 disability advisory group , comprising experts in disability inclusion .
The opposition party stated that the government announced investments of $ 70 million to offset financial losses in the tourism industry across Canada , but it was not enough . There would be job losses and permanent closures of restaurants and boardwalk shops . The Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages explained that those who had experienced losses would be able to have access to the wage subsidy , the rent relief program , the CEBA and ACOA funding . Also , another minister explained that the Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance had committed an additional $ 1 billion to help those businesses that fall through the cracks .
The minister placed assurance on coming out with a broader plan once the pandemic situation became more stable economically . At the same time , coming into this pandemic in a strong fiscal position with the lowest amount of debt among the G7 countries gave the government opportunities to invest on behalf of Canadians , and they would continue to take that approach . And the minister promised that there would not be higher taxes .
The opposition party stressed that the government needed to present a picture of the economic situation and a picture of its overall emergency measures . The minister explained that they felt that it was very important to consider what that need to do in each phase of the recovery . Thus , they would not announce an overall recovery plan any sooner .
Firstly , User Interface introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its function . The prototype was a pretty simple design in a mango shape with the company logo on it and innovative functions like the plus button . Secondly , Marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of both the conceptual as well as functional meetings and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product to see if the prototype would meet the original requirements and goals . Thirdly , the team calculated the cost of the prototype and found that the most expensive part was the use of kinetic . But the team decided to use regular chips and cheap materials , which made the budget under control . Lastly , the team gave positive feedback on the project and the process .
The prototype was a pretty simple design in a mango shape with the company logo on it and an on-off button . The color of the prototype was vanilla and yellow like and the material was a combination of rubber and plastic with a company logo . Moreover , there was a circular design for the numbers so it could be palm-held , accessible from the user ' thumb . Besides , a plus button was added on the device so the channels could be switched easily without any confusion.For instance , one plus two it could go to channel twelve . But this function was challenged by Industrial Designer who argued that it was not snappy since the five-second pause input time was enough for switching to the double-digit channel . After all , the team agreed that it was overall , a good design , well representing the company 's identity .
Marketing recalled both the conceptual and functional meetings and made a list of what the original requirements and goals were based on kick-off meetings this morning . For the ten questions , Marketing asked the team to give one to seven points to each feature of the product and the lower the points the better the feature .
The team agreed that the prototype had a fancy look-and-feels once they did not choose the traditional ugly black and grey color but incorporated the company 's color . Although , there were only push buttons and no LED display , the incorporation of the kinetic energy , making the device more durable and rubber material made it technologically innovative . Moreover , the team thought the device was easy to use and good looking but Project Manager suggested that the company logo could be smaller . Besides , the device 's simplistic made it stand out and customers were willing to pay a little more for that and its good appearance . Last but not least , the device could match the operating behavior of the average user and the alarming function , a light would vibrate , added value to the device .
Firstly , using kinetic was quite a large expense at three Euros . Secondly , in terms of the material used on the device , the team decided to use a combination of rubber and plastic to cut costs with one color for the case and one color for the buttons . Moreover , the push button interface was inexpensive so the team agreed to add a special form for the case . Lastly , ssthe team did not choose joystick , LED display or advanced chips , they were able to make the budget under control .
The team thought that the project manager showed good leadership and that was a must during the teamwork process . Besides , they had a really great project design experience and everyone had put efforts into the process and gave opinions to design a good remote control . After all , they have learned a lot from each other as well as the overall customers ' tastes within the industry .
The group mainly talked about the detailed design of the product at this meeting . First , the industrial designer introduced the function design of the product . It had not only some basic functions , but also the locator function and provided users with a revolutionary way of zapping . Later , the group went on to check the controller 's paging ability and talked about more details on buttons . Next , the marketing expert mentioned three things making the product marketable and one possible drawback of the product . Besides , the marketing recommended making it upgradable but the project manager pointed out the risk of doing that . When evaluating the cost of the product , the group discussed some details of the components and made some adjustments . They finally got an estimate of fifteen point eight Euros , which was within the budget . In the end , they did some self-assessment and celebrated the completion of the project .
The industrial designer introduced that the product not only had some basic functions , it also had the locator function and provided users with a revolutionary way of zapping . As for the material , the product would be made of plastic and rubber . In addition , the final design was thought to be slightly lighter and smaller than the present model . Later , the group went on to check the controller 's paging ability and talked about some details on buttons .
The user interface designer thought it might be interesting to have a trigger button on the controller because it felt like there should be something , but they could n't figure out what button was important enough to put there and they did n't want to accidentally hit the power button . Then the project manager proposed that having a trigger plus the scroll might solve the problem of landing and scrolling as it would be hit on both sides . The user interface designer agreed and further suggested tweaking that a little bit in the final design phase .
The marketing expert thought there were three things making the product marketable - the features , the characteristics , and the corporation behind the product . One drawback of the product was that it was only targeted at TV , but the marketing believed this limitation would n't be noteworthy in comparison with other good features . Besides , the marketing proposed that the product should be upgradable but the project manager pointed out the risk of doing that .
The marketing expert thought there were three things making the product marketable - the features , the characteristics , and the corporation behind the product . The features included the scroll , the locator , durability , and dependability . The characteristics referred to reliability , comfort , ergonomics , and being environmentally sensitive . As for the business background , they were a new company wanting to make a name for themselves and aiming at supplying good products at a fair price . All these above made the product competitive and the marketing believed they should go after more of the exclusivity sense than the mass market sense .
The marketing suggested producing the controller in a way that makes it upgradable like a sim card in the telephone . However , the industrial designer argued that if the controller was to have other functions it would need more buttons and they should design another version instead . Also , the project manager pointed out there would be some risks of making it unusable or less usable .
When evaluating the cost of the product , the group discussed some details of the components and made some adjustments on the chip , curve , button and scroll wheel . They finally got an accurate estimate of fifteen point eight Euros , which was thought to be within the budget of twelve-five Euros .
This was a Children , Young People and Education Committee , and the purpose of the meeting is to undertake stage 2 proceedings on the Children ( Abolition of Defense of Reasonable Punishment ) Bill . This meeting followed a certain order to dispose of all amendments . It went through amendments in group 1 that related to the duty to promote public awareness , amendments in group 2 that related to the duty to report on the effect of the legislation , amendments in group 3 that related to the regulation-making powers in the Bill , amendments in group 4 that related to the duty to ensure sufficient funding , and finally amendments in group 5 that related to commencement . At the end of each section , they took a vote to decide whether certain amendments should be rejected or accepted .
There was a debate of whether amendment 1 and 4 , and 1A to 1E should be accepted or rejected . The Deputy Minister firstly expressed her opinions . She was in favor of amendments 1 and 4 , but against 1A to 1E , mainly because she thought that level of details were not necessarily on the face of the Bill . However , Janet Finch-Saunders thought the Deputy Minister 's amendment lacked a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at stage 1 and explained one by one from 1A to 1E why those amendments were important . Afterwards , there was a short debate about whether to accept those amendments from Suzy Davies , Dawn Bowden , Hefin David and Sian Gwenllian . Suzy Davies supported amendment 1A to 1E , while others all against them . At last , they took a vote and it ended up with rejecting amendment 1A to 1E and agreeing with amendment 1 .
Her amendments 1 and 4 would place a duty on Welsh Ministers to provide information and increase awareness about the change in the law . She had already made a commitment to a high-intensity awareness-raising campaign over about six years from Royal Assent if the Bill passed . She thought amendments 1A to 1E which relate to the duty to raise awareness were not necessary . In specific , amendment 1A was open-ended on promoting public awareness . All the raised points would be considered by another group , but she thought the level of the detail on the face of the Bill was not needed , and same reasons for amendment 1B and 1D . As for the amendment 1C which was about how to raise concerns , the Deputy Minister thought the safeguarding was everybody 's business . In conclusion , she asked for the support of members for amendments 1 and 4 , and asked to reject amendments 1A to 1E , as those were unnecessary provisions in terms of what the awareness-raising duty needed to achieve .
While it was imperative that the public were made aware of this controversial change in the law , she thought the Deputy Minister 's amendment lacked a number of key points that the committee were actually keen to address at stage 1 . For example , Amendment 1A changed amendment 1 to include the promotion of understanding changes to the law . Amendment 1B stated that there should be details about the support available to parents to use alternatives to physical punishment when discipline their children , which she thought was very important to parents . Amendment 1C explained that the Welsh Government should ensure clear advice was provided on what people could do if they had seen a child being physically assaulted , and this could help raise public awareness of how they could report and in what situations they could report .
The Deputy Minister firstly expressed her opinions . She thought amendment 2C would require Welsh Ministers to prepare and lay before the Assembly a report on the effect of their promotion of public awareness before section 1 was commenced , and she thought this was unnecessary and was in conflict with what she thought was a priority for the implementation of this Bill . She also thought this amendment was not required because they were preparing to assess the effectiveness of the awareness raising . Then Janet Finch-Saunder expressed her opinion , and spoke to amendments 2C excluding 2D to 2K . After this , Suzy Davies proposed several opinions against the Deputy Minister . In specific , Suzy Davies did not think the amendment should affect the commencement date at all , to respond to the comments the Deputy Minister made for amendment 2C . At last , they took a vote and ended up with losing 2C - 2K , and accepting amendment 2 .
The Deputy Minister had provided assurance that she agreed with the importance placed on the post-implementation review , and made a commitment to bring forward a Government amendment to put a duty to undertake a post-implementation review on the face of the Bill . Amendment 2C would require Welsh Minister to prepare and lay before the Assembly a report on the effect of their promotion of public awareness before section 1 is commenced , and the Deputy Minister thought this amendment was unnecessary and was in conflict with what she thought was a priority for the implementation of this Bill . The Deputy Minister did not want to support amendments 2A , 2C and 2E to 2K , because these amendments made little difference in terms of practical effect to what they had in the Bill already . In conclusion , she would ask members to reject the non-Government amendments and agree to amendments 2 and 5 .
Janet Finch-Saunders spoke to amendments 2C , excluding 2D , to 2K , which related to the Deputy Minister 's amendment 2 on preparing a published report on the effect of abolishing the defense of reasonable punishment . Amendments 2E to 2K outlined what they would expect to be within the report . Amendment 2C requested that the Welsh Government prepared a report on the awareness-raising campaign and laid it before the Assembly before section 1 commenced . It was important that they were fully apprised of the awareness-raising campaign 's impact , which was elaborated under amendment 2D .
The Deputy Minister proposed that she encouraged members to reject amendment 3A . She said she was not seeking to add any new powers to the Bill . Amendment 3 would simply add the existing power back onto the face of the Bill , where amendments 7 and 8 remove it , and amendment 6 would bring the power into force the day after Royal Assent . Then Suzy Davies said that amendment 3A was a holding position , and they would return this to the Deputy Minister in stage 3 . Suzy thought this was an area where it might be valuable to discuss quite what kind of powers they were looking for , because Suzy Davies thought the Deputy Minister might need something that was beyond transitional , transitory and saving . At last , they took a vote for this and ended up with rejecting amendment 3A , and agreeing on amendment 3 .
As a consequence of proposing to remove the power for a Welsh Minister to make an order for commencement , the power to make transitory , transitional or saving provisions in connection with section 1 of the Bill coming into force would also be removed . Amendment 2 would add the existing power back onto the face of the Bill where amendments 7 and 8 removed it , and amendment 6 would bring the power into force the day after Royal Assent . These amendments were technical in nature and while she acknowledged that the Constitutional and Legislative Affairs Committee raised the issue of what procedure should be applied , their report did not call for any change to no procedure being applied . The absence of an Assembly procedure did not mean that Ministers ' decisions in relation to transitional powers can not be scrutinized by the Assembly . In conclusion , she encouraged members to reject amendment 3A .
Suzy Davies thought that one person 's technical issue was another person 's essential part of the legislative procedure and a keen element in scrutiny . Suzy Davies was glad that amendment 8 had removed an order provision . Suzy Davies thought amendment 3A was something of a probing amendment . The amendment 3 seek to give a familiar range of powers in connection with the coming into force of section 1 , but it was not a separate commencement power . Amendment 3A was a holding position , which they would return this in Stage 3 , because Suzy Davies thought this was an area where this might be valuable to discuss quite what kind of powers were required . Suzy Davies thought there might be something that was beyond transitional , transitory and saving .
This discussion started with Janet Finch-Saunders and Janet Finch-Saunders spoke to both amendments in this group . She said the reason she wanted these two amendments be there because she genuinely did not believe that the Deputy Minister had envisioned what or even estimated the likely cost to be borne by the organizations , and certainly their local authorities and health boards and impact of the Bill was going to have . Then the Deputy Minister responded to this . She said they had done a thorough and extremely diligent job of considering the potential impacts of the Bill before introduction . She thought all the evidence had shown that they did not anticipate that there would be a huge increase of a demand for funding , so she encouraged members to reject these amendments , which she thought were not necessary . At last , they took a vote on amendments 11 and 12 , and ended up with rejecting amendments 11 and 12 , and agreeing with amendment 4 and 5 .
Janet Finch-Saunders said that there were ongoing concerns about the potential costs for Welsh devolved authorities and the lack of quantifiable costs within the regulatory impact assessment . While amendment 11 referred to costs borne by local authorities and health boards , Janet Finch-Saunders had noted that amendment 12 took this further by including other devolved authorities that were not funded by Welsh Government . Janet Finch-Saunders wanted these amendments because she genuinely did not believe that they had even envisioned what or even estimated the likely cost to be borne by the organizations , and certainly their local authorities and health boards , and the impact the Bill was going to have .
The Deputy Minister understood that the impact of this Bill on public services was concerned ; however , she said that they had done a thorough and extremely diligent job of considering the potential impacts of the Bill before introduction . She cited several people 's sentences , to demonstrate that the Bill was removing a defense to an offence of common assault , which had formed part of the common law of England and Wales for a very long time . This was not a completely new area of costly activity for any of them . The Deputy Minister thought all the evidence had shown that they did not anticipate that there would be a huge increase of a demand for funding , so she encouraged members to reject these amendments , which she thought were not necessary .
The group discussed plans and concerns regarding the architecture of SmartKom , its proposed modules , and the types of interactions expected to take place between modules . The meeting was largely focused on SmartKom 's decision making capacity and how to adapt this functionality to the tourist information domain . The group set a date for assessing SmartKom plans .
It was decided that SmartKom 's action plans should be represented in XML as a state transition network . It was proposed that the term 'dialogue planner ' should replace 'dialogue manager ' . Prolog will be phased out completely and replaced by Java code . The dialogue manager must be capable of changing states , i.e . go from being event driven to answering a question from a planning module .
SmartKom should feature a well defined core interface , with domain-specific information kept external . A syntactic analysis component that performs chunk parsing will be added to the system .
As a functional module , the action planner is too restrictive for the tourist domain and requires complex slots from the dialogue manager . Interactions in a deep map system between the spatial planner and the route planner are too convoluted . SmartKom requires a fast and robust parser that includes language-specific extensions .
Efforts are in progress to complete and test the code , generate an English grammar like that used in the German system , and get the parser interface working . A 'wizard of Oz ' style data collection experiment is in progress to model users ' underlying intentions when communicating with the dialogue component of a tourist domain GPS .
The meeting began with the members ' personal presentations on the conceptual remote control . The Marketing would like the remote control to be with an appealing appearance and light material to attract more young consumers . The User Interface proposed to add a speak recognition system onto the remote control so that it would be able to function according to the user 's instruction . After the presentations , they spent some time on the button layout and the shape of the remote control . Though the discussion was mostly smooth , they hardly reached an agreement towards the materials . At the end of the meeting , the group talked about the company features on the product , including a slogan and a logo .
According to the Marketing , the drawback of the existing remote controls was that they were not so good-looking , so their conceptual remote control would be with an appealing and bright color.The Industrial Designer laid his emphasis on the materials that he would not like the remote control to be made in a too formal way , like those the elders were using . As for the User Interface , he proposed to add a speak recognition system onto the remote control in order to make it able to function once it received the user 's voice instruction .
The Marketing proposed to use titanium as the material of the front side of the remote control for that it would look strong but not be so hard to handle . However , he went on to point out the problem that the color would be dark , which meant that it might not cater for the youth 's tastes . Thus they might not use the titanium as the main material .
In order to meet with the annual trend of fruity elements , the Industrial Designer suggested making the remote control in a banana shape . For one thing , it would be related to the annual fashion trend and for another , the yellow color would satisfy the youth . However , in case the banana shape would be out of fashion next year , it might not be a perfect solution .
As to cater to the fashion trend , the group decided to put the remote control in a fruity shape and a bright lovely color . Then in order to make their product both good-looking and comfortable to hold , they reached the agreement that the front side of the remote control would be made of plastic while the back would be made of titanium . The group also spent some time on the internal design of the product , for example , the chip would be made of silicon and electrical cable would be just the same as other counterparts .
While discussing the button layout , the group found that some of the elements could not be removable on the remote control , so the Industrial Designer proposed to make those elements with titanium and other things with plastic . However , the Marketing did not agree with this because he thought the plastic would not make the remote control look strong or be satisfactory to be held in hand .
The User Interface proposed to make most of the buttons in a round shape which altogether located in a triangle . In the middle of the triangle , there would be a square button and the four buttons next to it would be respectively the channel control and the volume control , just as all the other remote controls .
The group mainly talked about the interface design and price setting of the product . Firstly , the user interface designer gave a presentation on the prototype of the product . They provided the prototypes with a lot of details on the appearances and those details were then further discussed by the group.After that , the marketing expert used a seven-point scale to evaluate the prototype according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . They Cleared some misconceptions and reached a consensus on the targeting group and how they could adapt the product better to suit their needs . Then they discussed the price setting of the product and how many functions needed to be retained or removed . As they were trying very hard to remain the price at twelve and a half Euro , they squabbled over the plus and minus of the functions . In the end , they finalized on the costs and planned a celebration for the closing down of the project .
The marketing expert confirmed with the group that the product was aimed at people with age below forty , but it was also designed for people above forty . The marketing expert also stated that people would need a teletext button because it was originally combined with the menu in the prototype . After that , the marketing expert discussed with the designers to design the prototype with fresh colours so it would be more discoverable when lost . They also agreed on the button numbers and the texture .
At first the user interface designer wanted to make the remote control curvy . The marketing expert was skeptical of the curvy outlook because it was interrelated with the budget . The marketing expert was concerned as the expert thought it was not necessary . However , the user interface designer insisted on the curvy design as it had a strong aesthetic value . In the end , the designers compromised to make the remote control flat and single-curved instead of double-curved .
The user interface designer was trying to implement a more dynamic and youthful colour on the remote control . However , the designers did not want it to be too childish and stated their will to make it more of an adult-style . Thus they wanted to use metallic grey as the colour of the appearance , and make an extra cover with flashy fruity colours to attract the broader public . Since their target aim was still younger people , a cover would make them more flexible to change the remote control into whatever colour they wanted .
The project manager wanted to remove the kinetic function as the manager thought it would be a desirable cost reduction . However , the industrial designer did not agree with the project manager because the designer thought it would be a good marketing promotion as people would think that remote controls with kinetic function are cool . Since they still wanted the price to remain on the same level , they decided to adapt the control into a flat one so as to minimize the cost .
This was the kick-off meeting for the project . First of all , Project Manager led each group member to know each other and introduced the project which was aiming to design remote control . Next , they discussed their favourite animal characteristics . Lastly , Project Manager mentioned how they worked on each part individually .
There were four people in the project team and each one introduced to each other on the team role . Project Manager introduced the project was about designing a remote control . After that , Project Manager explained the work division for each person and how they would present in the coming meetings .
The group was greeting each other at the first meeting . Laura was the Project Manager . David was Industrial Designer and Andrew was Marketing expert . And User Interface was named Craig .
Group mates all should have received an email introducing what was this project about and there would be three different stages to the design . The project was about designing a new remote control , which was supposed to be original , trendy , and user friendly .
Industrial Designer drew a whale because whales came in and went to eat everything in sight , and they were harmless , interesting , and mild . Project Manager drew a dog because the dogs were friendly and cheery . Next , about the finance and the workflow . The target revenue was fifty million Euros and the target was on an international scale . The cost was 25 Euros . Group mates would receive requirement emails and work on them individually .
Project manager mentioned that they had no background information on the competitor , however , they could analyze based on the product price . And Marketing supplemented that the remote control was something that people would not consciously assess in their purchasing habits .
The group had a discussion about the first remote control with cable and huge buttons on it . So they would like to try new technology like a touch screen and nicer materials for the remote , which was important for technology improvement .
The whole meeting was the final meeting of the project for discussion about the final design and project evaluation . Firstly , though Project Manager came late , he efficiently started the prototype presentation , during which Industrial Designer and User Interface presented the final design they worked out together . However , part of the features contained in their design , particularly too many buttons , were effectively rejected in the finance phase to reduce cost . Then , Marketing hosted the product evaluation and calculated a total score for their new remote control . After that , Project Manager guided the process evaluation and led the project to the closing phase .
When the group found out that they came across a fairly tight budget , they cut the number of batteries from 2 to 1 and chose plastic as the cheapest case material supplement . But they still kept the advanced chip , LCD screen , and docking station , all of which they considered to be the strength of the product . After that , they touched on the button issue and realized that that was where the biggest cost driver hid . As a hurry solution , they quickly discarded the help and the mute button , replaced buttons for the program with a scroll-wheel , and removed a volume button and a channel button to reduce cost .
Firstly , when the group realized that cost was chiefly incurred by excessive buttons , they quickly decided to discard the help and the mute button . But then they found out that the primary cost drivers were 10 buttons for program numbers . To get rid of them , Project Manager boldly proposed replacing them with a scroll-wheel , which was finally accepted despite disputes over its unfriendly nature for elderly users . Also , the group agreed to remove a volume and a channel button by shifting the up-and-down function onto scroll-wheel and having radio buttons .
First and foremost , Marketing believed that the elder generation expected to have ten buttons for the number one to zero , rather than a scroll-wheel with radio buttons , which would inevitably harm the usability . In this case , a lot of marketing would be required to convince elderly users , who were unfamiliar with fancy stuff like scroll-wheel at all . Additionally , he complained that the cost limit made it almost impossible to produce anything better than normal controls , and that he would not make those impelled changes if it was not for cost 's sake .
Though Project Manager forgot to prepare evaluation criteria beforehand , Marketing had analyzed project requirements and brought forward a systematic set of criteria , according to which product was graded by the whole group . Then , under the guidance of Project Manager , the group evaluated the project process . Eventually , the meeting stepped into the closing phase .
On the basis of literature study and requirements analysis carried out by Marketing , specific criteria were as follows : design innovation , learnability , functionality , utility , cost , target customer , recognizability , etc . After the group brought forward a score for each in sequence , the total score was calculated as 84 % , which was acknowledged as a nice score .
When it came to processing evaluation , though Industrial Designer appeared to think highly of Project Manager 's arrangements , Marketing clearly voiced his dissent . as he explained , it is obvious that financial issues were touched on too late , making it imperative to further adjust to the final design during budget control . Project Manager himself admitted that there existed a lack of information about prices , which in fact led to a number of unrealistic dialogues about costly functions like recognition .
In this meeting , the team brainstormed about the look , functions and gadgets to adopt in the remote control and finally reached a decision on the overall design . The meeting started with discussion on the technical functions based on some new requirements delivered by Project Manager and on market research results presented by Marketing . In the end , the team agreed on including mainly basic functions on the remote control , adding a joystick-like gadget that was able to charge and track the device , enlarging certain buttons and making it flashy .
Industrial Designer believed that the working design did not involve specialised technologies and therefore would not cost much or be difficult . User Interface questioned this statement by arguing that the technical functions depended on the user requirements . The team discussed this point and then agreed that the remote control should be for novice users . Later on , Project Manager suggested going through market research results delivered by Marketing and the new requirements shown by themself . These clarified the directions of design and then the team agreed to include simple functions , certain large buttons , etc .
Project Manager considered it necessary to focus on customers younger aged below forty because they have potential needs to be fulfilled . By contrast , Marketing believed that the project should target a large group rather than only people younger than forty .
User Interface did not like the idea of putting lots of functions in the remote control because younger people were looking for a trendy look rather than multiple functions .
At first , Project Manager pointed out that the key lied in users ' pain point , which was the trouble of losing remote controls . The team then started brainstorming in this direction , coming up with ideas such as a can opener , bouncing pads , big buttons , flashy design , changeable fronts , etc . Later on , Project Manager put forward the idea of having a gadget like a vase to be put on the table , for containing the remote control . This idea then developed into one containing a base that could charge and track the remote control .
Project Manager believed that money spent on the rechargeable units was necessary because other elements of the remote control were just basic . In addition , Project Manager thought it would not cost much if the product was produced in Taiwan . However , it was acknowledged that cost could probably be a concern so he/ she decided to only do that if the cost was fair .
To Industrial Designer , remote controls could last a long time with two batteries . Therefore , it might not be necessary or attractive enough to customers in his/ her opinion .
This meeting mainly talked about the Abolition of Defence of Reasonable Punishment Bill . Julie Morgan , Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services , and Karen Cornish , deputy director of the Children and Families Division , took charge of answering the relevant questions . To start with , the meeting first discussed the motivation of such legislation and the impact on social service and other agencies . Support for parents and teachers were then discussed , involving their demands and means to address . To continue , the meeting turned to the criminal perspective , discussing the out-of-court disposals , malicious reporting , and non-conviction information . The next step was to talk about costings , followed by the topic of human rights and eventually the awareness raising .
Julie Morgan thought there was a need for legislation to ban any physical punishment and this bill aimed at protecting children 's rights . To ensure the effectiveness of the bill , there was an implementation group with representatives of the police , the crime commissioner , the Crown Prosecution Service , and the social service . Therefore , Julie Morgan was confident about the implementation of legislation . Furthermore , ongoing monitoring had been used to look for the view of the public and ongoing evaluation would come to practice in the next step .
All forms of physical punishment including smacks from a loving parent should be prohibited by legislation to protect children 's rights . There were multiple other ways to help parents bring up children rather than the physical punishment .
Julie Morgan pointed to the importance of knowing the effect of legislation . To attain this goal , their team has put forward the ongoing monitoring and surveys in terms of the views of the public . In the following steps , ongoing evaluation would be added for independent individuals .
Julie Morgan answered questions about the bill 's impact on other agencies , including the social service , MASHs , CAFCASS . Morgan emphasized the dependence of their work as well as the feasibility of workload changed by the bill .
Julie Morgan and Karen Cornish thought it was really important for agencies , like social services , the police , MASHs to work together in a consistent and appropriate way . However , the team was not dependent on others ' work , considering not every area would get their help .
Julie Morgan first paid tribute to the work done by social workers . Then , Morgan gave examples from the professionals that there had not been a big rise of referrals , but a slight increase at the beginning which was estimated to fall over time . Moreover , he indicated that a baseline would work in the future to see what exactly happened .
As for the parenting issues , the legislation would go up to 18 years old , providing parenting information of different ages . Also , a mapping exercise would be carried out by officials to clearly identify existing gaps and opportunities to do more . As for school issues , teachers would learn childcare legislation by attending training courses , and the group committee would provide procedures and processes needed to deal with different cases . The discussion then further talked about health and communication problems , including the promotion of the work of health visitors , teachers ' responsibilities , and the intentions for mapping exercise in the next step .
Julie Morgan thought the cost of training would be minimal as teachers had had courses about childcare issues and something about the bill would be absorbed into that without any additional fund .
The Healthy Child Wales programme and the role of health visitors were really crucial as providing universal service . Based on the bill , they could promote positive parenting by encouraging parents not to use physical punishment . As for people who did not access the Healthy Child Wales programme and the issues regarding coverage , the group would identify the gaps and relative measures with a mapping exercise .
Julie Morgan said the team had done their best preparation to cover all eventualities , such as the awareness-raising campaign , a mapping exercise , and the arrangements of organizations . Later on , Morgan told something about an in-the-round discussion with the Cabinet , where some costings had been decided .
Morgan admitted the existence of unknown cost but emphasized the best preparation done by the team to cover all eventualities . As for public service , the team relied on the information gained from the organizations and Morgan pointed out legislation was put on to the part where public service had been dealing with and for that , there would not be a big impact .
The amount of money decided on the awareness-raising campaign was £2.2 million over six years . With the organ donation bill , it was about £4 million . Karen felt confident with the amount in terms of the initial stages of the awareness campaign .
This was the third meeting of conceptual design , including three presentations and a conclusive discussion to make some specific decisions . First , Industrial Designer introduced and led to a discussion about different options for the components of the circuit board , the energy sources , and the materials of casing and button . Next , User Interface gave the second presentation about interface concept and two types of user interfaces : the graphical user interface and the command interface , and strongly recommended the latter . The last presentation by Marketing reported the trend-watching for remote control and the relevant discussion centralized the trendy theme of vegetable and fruit . Given all of the information , the group eventually decided on some special designs , such as the kinetic energy , the regular chip , the plastic rubber coat , the interchangeable plate , the command line interface , and the basic buttons .
First , Industrial Designer introduced three optional sources of energy and recommended kinetic energy as they were light , novelty , and environmental-friendly . Project Manager agreed , but Marketing suggested it should be corporated with a battery backup in case something went wrong . After that , the group discussed solar energy , considering it impractical for remote control although it can be stored . With complete confidence by Industrial Designer and Project Manager , the group finally reconciled with the idea of full kinetic energy and treated it as one selling point .
Industrial Designer indicated rubber was softer than metal , cheaper than titanium that would exceed the budget , and more flexible to color alternatives . Although rubber could n't work as the interior to protect innards , rubber coating would reduce the impact if the remote control was dropped .
User Interface regarded the command interface as useful for remote control . It was less complicated and more user-friendly . In comparison , the interface consisting of many buttons , colors , and functions would n't improve the use of the product and was challenging to understand . As for expense , the command interface was also cheaper . Therefore , more budget could be targeted to the design area .
In the presentation , Marketing listed the three most important aspects of remote control . The priority was to have a fancy look-and-feel instead of the traditional one . Secondly , the remote control should be technologically innovative . Moreover , it should be easy to use . Marketing also mentioned that fruit and vegetables would be the popular theme this year . In this way , the group turned to discuss some ideas about combining this theme with their design , like applying an abstract design and putting photos on the product .
Industrial Designer thought that the vegetable and fruit theme could be applied with a more abstract design , like stripping it down to basic shapes or curves . Also , as a result of market research , design development should stick to this theme rather than moving to animals .
The group selected the regular-style chip without the LCD display . It only had simple push buttons except for a more advanced one for the interior lighting system .
Firstly , User Interface and Industrial Designer introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its form , material and the colour . The prototype was a pretty simple design with an obvious company logo on it and two buttons in the middle . Secondly , Marketing designed an evaluation test under the guidance of the advantages of its main features discussed before and the team gave one to seven points to each feature of the product to see if the prototype would meet the original requirements and goals . Lastly , the team calculated the cost of the prototype and found that it was not easy to land on the exact budget . After trying to incorporate as many functions as the team could for a while , the team decided to use regular chips , normal batteries and a combination of cheap materials and fancy ones , which made the budget under control .
The prototype was a pretty simple design with an obvious company logo on it and two buttons in the middle . There were also power buttons and nine others for switching channels with the incorporation of the menu and teletext . In the middle there was a part of hard material , a bit of hard plastic with a light behind it . In terms of materials and color , the team designed one colour for the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber buttons . Also , the team agreed that the company logo , together with the standard color could be the company 's identity . Last but not least , the current device did not include the docking station but the Marketing expressed his interest towards it and the team decided to reconsider it in the following parts of the meeting .
Marketing recalled the market trend and collected images based on the device the team had designed . For each of Marketing 's questions , the team would give one to seven points to each feature of the product and the lower the points the better the feature .
The team agreed that the prototype had a moderate appearance and it really depended on the individual taste of each customer . Some might find the device really fancy . However , the function that enabled the user to design for its own front look stood out since this could add value to users ' favour towards personalities . The team also came to an agreement that the remote control 's relevant buttons were prominently visible and relevant to each other , making the device easy to use . There was also a speaker incorporated into the device , solving the problem that sometimes it was out of sight . Meanwhile , the innovation of this device which was without a LCD display or any other technology required functions was not that satisfactory .
Firstly , the team agreed that only one battery is enough and using kinetic was not a must since it would be too expensive and useless . Secondly , one chip was enough and they were going to choose one from different types of regular chips . However , as the team found out they could incorporate more valuable components , the team decided to use one advanced chip for now . In terms of the material used on the device , the team decided to use a combination of rubber and plastic with one small part used in one special materia , like titanium , as well as a special color . Moreover , the teletext was discarded and the docking station was added . As for the infrared LED , although it was originally presented on Marketing 's powerpoint , the team agreed that it was not helpful . Later , the team found that regular chips were enough for the scroll-button and only the LCD display required the advanced ones , so again the team came back for the regular chip and cut some costs . In the end , the team incorporated solar cells for the battery .
The first phase of the data collection has finished . There is a new wizard for phase two , during which subjects will be given more complex scenarios . An alternative representation of the Bayes-net , it depicts context features as classes , and dependencies as relations between them . Following this , a visiting researcher presented an overview of a parallel project at the International University . It attempts to build a smart tutoring system for a computer science course . The assumption is that document searches can give more personalised results , if they take into account contextual parameters ( user , situation ) . There were also further suggestions for meetings with ICSI researchers .
The first phase of the data collection has finished . There is a new wizard for phase two , during which subjects will be given more complex scenarios . Also finished are the modifications on SmartKom : the remaining glitches will take no more than a day to iron out . A big part of the meeting was covered by the presentation of the PRM of the proposed system .
As the data collection is going into its second phase , more complex scenarios will be used to generate more intricate dialogues . Subjects can be recruited from within the Psychology department students , since such participation in experiments is compulsory in their syllabus .
An alternative representation of the Bayes-net , it depicts context features as classes , and dependencies as relations between them . The current outputs show the desirability of a site , as well as its EVA mode . The fact that this model allows for instantiations of classes fits the research purposes much better than the extended belief-net .
Project Manager introduced the agenda of the meeting , and the group became acquainted with each other . The selling target of the remote control would be set as four million . The group discussed industrial design , working design including the theme of Hello Kitty and bright colours . They also decided that the remote control was only for television , and its technical functions must be simple and marketing the user requirements specification .
The preliminary aim of the profit was fifty million Euros . The setting price was twenty-five Euros each remote control , and therefore the profit was twelve and a half Euros per item . To reach the profit goal of fifty million , Marketing set a sales figure of four million .
The setting price of each remote control that Project Manager proposed was twenty-five , but Marketing had doubts about the profits . Marketing was n't sure that if the mark-up of fifty percent is normal for a product , and preferred sixty percent .
Project Manager thought that setting the selling target was of high importance for a big international company making marketing plans including sales target .
User Interface presumed that the remote control was only for the television , and suggested that the technical functions should be simple and removed the superfluous functions . They also suggested setting the theme of the remote control as Hello Kitty , and making it in bright colours .
User Interface argued that the simplicity of the remote control of high importance , which means superfluous functions such as subtitles and mute should be removed from the remote control and be controlled through the menu .
User Interface held the same opinion as Industrial Designer that different remote controls that were incompatible with each other brought inconvenience to users . User Interface still presumed that this remote control was only for television .
The whole meeting was about what the group should do for the remote control , from a good-looking appearance to a joyful user experience . At the beginning , the group had individual presentations about their previous research findings . Through those presentations , all of the four got a general idea about the target market , the functions and the layout . They talked about the functions carefully as well as the interface design of the remote control later on . Finally , under the leadership of the Project Manager , all the members got some assignments for their next detailed design .
According to the Marketing , the research finding showed that the current users are older than forty , which is to say that they have to aim the consumers at below forty as long as they want a new market . As for the User Interface , he thought an extra function was needed to hide all the features and display a clear menu . Of course , some fashionable functions would also be welcomed . Then the group came to realize that it would be really hard to compromise between the functions and the fashion .
As per his research , the Marketing found that the existing remote controls were not satisfactory in terms of their appearance and feel . In addition , some remote controls were not easy to find and very hard to master . What was also worth mentioning was that some details like the brightness of the screen and the colors needed improvement as well .
The User Interface put forward to add an extra function to the remote control to make it be able to hide some features and display a clear menu . The Project Manager was in favor of this design for that it would be easy to find those really essential functions on the menu more easily .
To maximize the satisfaction of the users , the first thing should be confirmed is that the power button should be put on the right top where it can be reached with a thumb easily . Then like all the remote controls , they should have up and down for the channels and left and right for the volume . Besides , the button for the screen brightness was also important . To make their remote control unique , the User Interface proposed to add their logo on it .
During their discussion of the button layout , the first agreement they achieved was that the power button should be put on the top of the remote control . Then the Project Manager proposed to put it on the right that most people are right-handed , however , considering that a few would be left-handed , the Marketing put forward to design some special additions to meet such need .
The User Interface proposed to add a logo on the remote control , but the problem came that it did matter much how to locate the screen and the logo . At first the Marketing planned to put the logo on the left top but then he elaborated himself that the logo should be the last one to be considered that it would be put wherever space was left , instead of letting the logo decide where the screen would be put .
This was the first meeting on the team 's project . It started with every member introducing themselves , getting to know each other 's names as well as their individual roles in the project . Project Manager then revealed the overall plan for their project , announcing that they were going to design a new television remote that would be both trendy and user-friendly . After that , each person drew their favourite animals on the whiteboard and shared their reasons for the choice , with Project Manager choosing an elk , Industrial Designer a cat , User Interface a dog , and Marketing a butterfly . Project Manager then added some financial details to their plan , setting their selling price and cost . In the following brainstorming time , they raised ideas on night-time operation , a tracking device , and the design for buttons and shape . Finally , Project Manager arranged tasks for each team member to take on until their next meeting .
The team took turns to draw their favourite animals on the whiteboard while discussing what characteristics of that animal they liked . Project Manager 's favourite animal at the time was an elk , since she considered it a large beautiful majestic creature that can overcome harsh terrain and defend itself . Industrial Designer followed with a cat , favoured for its independence and always knowing what they were doing . User Interface drew a dog , for dogs were trainable and friendly . Finally , Marketing chose a butterfly , seeing it as the symbol of spring arriving .
First , Project Manager announced that her favourite animal at the time was an elk . User Interface immediately joked that it looked vicious , what with the big antlers . Industrial Designer then asked whether everyone had elk where they came from . The team then complimented Project Manager 's drawing for the elk . Project Manager consequently gave her reasons for choosing the elk as her favourite , saying it was a large beautiful majestic creature that could overcome harsh terrain and defend itself . She considered that even though elks would appear awkward , they were actually very gorgeous animals .
Marketing drew a butterfly because she had seen one the day before , which she considered as the symbol of spring arriving . It was the prettiest butterfly she had ever seen out in the wild , and this was quite unusual where they lived . Mistaking it as a dead leaf at first , she saw the butterfly land next to her , showing as colourful and exotica body as that of a peacock . Marketing appreciated her encounter with the butterfly very much .
Marketing first talked about the fact that it was often hard to see the buttons in the dark . Industrial Designer followed by pointing out that remotes tend to go missing a lot , and thus a tracking device would be really helpful . User Interface then proposed that there are too many unnecessary buttons on a current remote , and a hidden panel for less used buttons would be useful . Project Manager further suggested that their remote could be some other shape instead of the standard rectangular , while the team reminded her that their product must be both novel and universally acceptable .
One function could be to let the buttons be distinguishable even in the dark , so that one could use the remote whether there was light or not . Another function could be to track the remote when it goes lost , probably realized through some kind of alarm on the remote and a button installed somewhere else . One last proposed function was to design a hidden panel for the remote , containing all the less used buttons so that they would n't take up too much space on the main panel and confuse the user .
The idea of giving the remote a novel shape instead of the standard rectangular was first raised by Project Manager . Marketing proposed a possible shell shape for the remote . Industrial checked whether they were going into novelty factors because the remote still had to be universally acceptable if they wanted it to sell . Yet it could n't be too boring , so it would be key for the team to figure out a way for the remote to be trendy and original , but at the same time not too outrageous .
This was the last meeting on the remote project . Industrial Designer and User Interface first gave the prototype presentation with a model remote they made based on previous team decisions , showing the design of colours , buttons , and shapes . Marketing then led the discussion on the evaluation criteria of their product , after which the team evaluated the remote in various aspects . As for finance , the team calculated the costs of each component of the remote , finding the total cost under their budget and thus allowing the remote to go into production . Finally , the team talked about their experience in the project process , digressing into a casual discussion on computers , cell phones , and ideas for commercials . The team members thanked each other for their effort .
Marketing first presented the evaluation criteria , including whether the remote was easy to use , whether it was fashionable , whether it feels good physically , and some other aspects . Using a seven-point scale from true to false , the team rated the remote on these aspects . All agreed to give 2 points for the remote being easy to use . With slight variations , the average point for it being fashionable is 2.5 . The average is 2 for it feeling good physically , and 3.5 for it being technologically innovative . Finally , the team also agreed on it being trendy and capable with a score around 2 .
On a 7-point scale from true to false , Project Manager first rated the remote at 1 point for it being undoubtedly fashionable . Yet Industrial Designer immediately objected to this . After Marketing seconded Project Manager 's evaluation , Industrial Designer hesitatingly gave it a 2 , saying it 's not fashionable enough at the moment . When Marketing and Project Manager defended their views by pointing out it 's only a prototype they 're seeing , Industrial Designer insisted on his objection and rerated it at 3 or 4 . This disagreement finally presented the average rating of 2 for the remote on the fashion criterion .
Marketing first wanted to check whether the remote was going to have the phrase recognition function . This function was not reflected on the model they were seeing , but User Interface and Industrial Designer confirmed that it could be realized with a special chip . Marketing thus decided that the remote was technologically innovative enough . Since the remote was only designed for TVs , it was rated 3 by Marketing , 3 or 4 by Project Manager , and 4 by User Interface . With an average of 3.5 , they agreed that the remote had reasonable technological innovation and was sufficient for their project .
Industrial Designer first pointed out that they got stifled for creativity by the company restricting their product to only a TV remote . User Interface complained about having no whiteboard or Internet . Marketing thought they did a great job in general , having control over the actual design . Industrial Designer and User Interface were satisfied with their teamwork , while Project Manager also commented on them being a congenial team . Further complaints were made on the survey , yet they appreciated the digital pens , wireless laptops , a shared network , dual microphones and Big Brother . Many new ideas were also found through this process .
Industrial Designer first complained that their creativity was limited by the company , since their initial idea for a multifunctional remote could not be realized . User Interface then complained about their lack of a whiteboard and the Internet , which was reiterated later in their discussion . Also , Project Manager , Industrial Designer and User Interface all said the survey they conducted was irritating .
Marketing commented on the overall process as fairly satisfying , since they had control over most of the detailed design of the remote , how it should be advanced as well as fashionable . As for teamwork , Industrial Designer and User Interface thought they worked well together , and Project Manager praised the team for being congenial . They also appreciated many things that were available to them , including digital pens , wireless laptops , a shared network , dual microphones , and Big Brother . They agreed that many new ideas were developed as well .
The meeting was mainly about the conceptual design of the remote control . Firstly , marketing introduced market research and fashion trends around the world . While the user interface emphasized that easy to use was more important . Then the industrial designer talked about the overall requirements from the engineering point of view , including the size of the device and source of energy . The group members spent time figuring out the real size of the TFT screen and energy problem . After that , they discussed the shape of the remote control and decided to make it like a banana . Based on this shape , they talked about the detailed design of the appearance and user interface .
From the marketing 's point of view , fancy was the highest priority , followed by technologically innovativeness and ease of use . The marketing expected the feel of the material to be spongy .
User interface thought that the feature easy to use was more important than being fancy . He mentioned that the more frequent buttons should be larger and be placed in good positions . He preferred to put some buttons in special places and cover these buttons , or put some buttons inside the remote control . And the remote control also had to be easily taken in hands and energy-saving .
The group members firstly made sure how big the seven-inch TFT screen was in reality . And they thought that the remote control should not be too big or too small , it should be fit in hands . Then they discussed how the screen and buttons could be reasonably put on the remote control .
The industrial designer thought that the solar cell was necessary for speech recognition . He mentioned that the daylight was enough for recharging . And he supposed that the remote control would be in the room which was usually lightful .
The user interface said that no matter large or small , taking in hand easily was the most important thing . The project manager also wanted the shape to be fashionable . Considering that the colour of their company was yellow , they decided to make the shape of the remote control like a banana .
The group members thought that the first layer would be spongy . It might be magnetic and would be like a plastic cover covering some buttons or USB interface . Users could open this cover like peeling a banana .
The whole meeting was the initial meeting of a new remote control project . Firstly , Project Manager introduced the scope and agenda of the project , and the team got acquainted with each other and technical devices . Then Project Manager made clear that remote control would be priced at 25 Euros and a production cost of 12.5 Euros , in order to achieve a profit aim of 50 million Euros . After an accident , Marketing suggested that remote control should be made multipurpose and the consensus was reached on this point . Finally , the group brainstormed some other functions for the remote control despite a potential increase in production cost .
Project Manager proposed that apart from ordinary remote controls , innovative use cases could be explored . Then Marketing suggested that a multipurpose remote control should be made to operate different devices including TV , video recorder , DVD player , etc .
Project Manager confirmed the feasibility of Marketing 's idea of the multipurpose remote control , and later he also brought up infra-red as an effective medium , over which cost-related doubt was expressed by himself , though .
Infra-red was mentioned by Project Manager along with the multipurpose function . Marketing proposed shock proof . User Interface put forward waterproof . And then Marketing went on to offer battery status display as an optional choice , which he had no idea was a great production cost driver or just a tiny LED .
When Project Manager proposed the application of infra-red , he himself admitted the risk of exceeding target cost . The same concern over battery status display was expressed by Marketing . Hence , he agreed to find out a specific cost before decision-making , with Marketing implying that he wanted it to be applied if possible .
When Marketing mentioned the application battery status display , he added that it could possibly drag up the production cost and that further research would be carried out before decision-making . But still , he implied that he wanted it to be applied if possible .
Project Manager announced that the remote control would be priced at 25 Euros , produced at a maximum cost of 12.5 Euros to achieve a profit aim of 50 million euros . And Project Manager went on to emphasize that the target market would be international , covering different kinds of users , cultures , and trends . No dissent was raised by other team members .
This was a Children , Young People and Education Committee , and it was the sixth scrutiny session on the Children Bill , specifically on Abolition of Defense of Reasonable Punishment . To start this meeting , Alastair Birch shared opinion on why people think the current law was inefficient and unclear , and then Sally Jenkins listed some evidence that physical punishment was actually harmful . Then they had some discussions on how to balance the need for greater clarity around the definition of what constitutes corporal punishment , and the importance of simplicity in the Bill . This discussion led to a further discussion on the implementation phase for that nuancing , and its impact on other services . After sharing all of these positive feedbacks in terms of the Bill and its intention , they had some discussions on unintended consequences for this Bill . Then some specific questions on implementation for social services , and its impact on education were proposed and answered . Finally , they had some discussions on the importance of awareness raising .
Huw David thought there were no unintended consequences if the Bill was implemented carefully with the right resources . Then he talked about the increasing number of looked-after children in Wales , and Sally Jenkins helped to explain the reasons for this . Alastair Birch thought that there would be an increased focus on the UNCRC . In addition , children need to be part of the discussion in terms of children having a discussion around this point , which would affect them . Improving the voice of the child in any educational context would be good and powerful for children , which would be a positive unintended consequence , and it could reinvigorate some of the voice of the child discussion within various contexts .
Huw David thought if this Bill was implemented carefully with the right resources , there might not be unintended consequences . However , for every piece of legislation , it would be about the implementation and the cultural change . Currently , the number of looked-after children in Wales were growing a lot , and this was because of the most appalling neglect and abuse . Huw David did not want this focus to be lost .
There were many reasons that had led to the increasing numbers of children becoming looked after across England and Wales , and it was hard to identify a single reason . Increased austerity was a part of this . In addition , an increased awareness of adverse childhood experiences and the emphasis of the impact on children of domestic abuse also affected this . It was also because of our understanding of what happened to children in those households . Besides , changes in our practice with colleagues in the judiciary , changes in the police service , and changes in the preventative services were other elements .
The first question was about whether members of the public should be encouraged to contact social services departments if they saw a child being smacked . Sally Jenkins answered that they had a duty to report this . Second question was about to what extent `` Anyone accused or convicted of assaulting a child will be subject to long-term social services involvement in their family and social stigma '' accurately . Sally Jenkins said that this was not punitive approaches from social services , and their aim was to get in and get out , and let families find their own solutions . Third question was about whether there was a need for legislation if natural behavior and the culture was changing . Huw David mentioned that there was already existing legislation that covered those children who were abused by parents . However , the threshold was not clear enough for children . Then they outlined the practical ways in which social services ' interaction with parents would change because of this proposed law . The last question was about the assessment of how this Bill would impact on emergency and out of hours local authority services . Sally Jenkins said that they had out-of-hours provision and emergency duty teams already across Wales that operate 24/7 . And there was no doubt that they exist and they work closely with police colleagues .
First , Sally Jenkins made it clear that very few numbers of families where they had long-term intervention currently . What they do was they go in for short periods in families ' lives to work with them and their family members . Their aim was to get in and get out . In terms of long-term intervention , they wanted families to find their own solutions . To conclude , this was not a punitive approach from social services .
Huw David said that there had already existed legislation that covered those children who were currently being assaulted and abused by their parents which went on a daily basis . However , the threshold of being abused was not clear , and children might be told that being smacked by their parents was acceptable . However , it was necessary to know where the line is , and this would be a step forward .
There were totally two questions proposed on impact on education . First , Jayne Bryant asked how confident they were that teachers and others working in those educational settings would be clear about how to support the implementation of this Bill . Alastair Birch responded that training requirements for all professionals in education settings were clear . The awareness needed to be clear for educational professionals that the duty to report was there . The second question was about whether there was a risk that those in education settings would have a key role in referring more parents to social services , which could cause potential harm to relationships and cause mistrust . Alastair Birch disagreed that this was a matter of mistrust . He thought if a professional believed there was significant harm to that child , they were under a duty to report that to social care .
Training requirements for all professionals in education settings were clear . The bible in terms of education professionals included 'keeping learners safe ' . Therefore , the awareness needed to be clear for educational professionals that the duty to report was there . When they feel the significant harm happened , they should report this and it would go to the childcare assessment team . And schools were fundamental in the support for the families , since they had the relationships with the families .
Alastair Birch did not think it was a matter of mistrust . Alastair Birch said that part of the work with families , and most of the referrals they made were with parental consent . This consent was a key element . For those that were not referred at threshold , it would come back to school for some support .
The first question was about how they should make it clear that the legislation is not trying to criminalize parents , and who should be responsible for this . Sally Jenkins responded that those drivers in relation to that awareness raising should be the key . There were a lot of ways for this including preventative services , universal services and etc . Then they had some discussions on whether the awareness raising should be on the face of the Bill and who should pay for this . Huw David was not sure whether being on the Bill was necessary , but he said it was worth consideration . Welsh Government Ministers should have a duty on this .
Sally Jenkins said that this was very broad . Colleagues in education , in social care , in preventative services , and also Welsh Government and the National Assembly were key to this . There were lots of routes that could go through in terms of raising awareness , including preventative services , universal services and regional safeguarding boards and the national safeguarding boards . It was about that wider issue of awareness raising , and using all of those avenues would help us to do that in the broadest sense .
Huw David said he was not sure whether this was necessary or not since he was not a legislator . Obviously , he thought there was an inherent interest in Welsh Government raising awareness . This was worthy of consideration . Then he said this should be a duty on Welsh Government Ministers .
After Project Manager 's brief review of the last meeting , Marketing began a presentation of the user requirements . It frustrated users most when they failed to find the lost remote control . The market research also revealed a necessity to simplify the remote control interface , for most buttons were not used . User Interface and Industrial Designer agreed on the intuitive interface design with menu navigation on an LCD screen and very few buttons involved . The new remote control would only be for basic functions such as volume adjusting and channel flipping . A separate joystick would be for additional functionality . The new remote control would be the integration of original remote controls for different devices . Voice recognition would not be feasible due to the budget limit . A speaker and a transmitter were desirable , however , for the location function .
Marketing presented the user requirements . The market research results were from 100 people . It frustrated users most when they failed to find the lost remote control . The market research also revealed a necessity to simplify the remote control interface , for users would not take time mastering the remote control . Most buttons were thus unused , and teletext was outdated now . Besides , Marketing expressed a negative view on the incorporation of voice recognition .
The market research indicated that between the age of 15 and 25 , most people would be willing to pay extra fees for voice recognition . However , Marketing pointed out that such a result barely implied users ' expectation for a fancy and unique remote control . There were several problems with the existing voice recognition software , such as the limitation on word number and inaccurate recognition results due to regional accents . In conclusion , Marketing considered the incorporation of voice recognition to be unfeasible .
User Interface and Industrial Designer agreed on the intuitive interface design with menu navigation on an LCD screen . Meanwhile , the team would involve as few buttons in the remote control interface as possible . The new remote control would only be for basic functions such as volume adjusting and channel flipping . A separate joystick would be for additional functionality . The new remote control would be the integration of original remote controls for different devices . Voice recognition was unfeasible due to the budget limit . A speaker and a transmitter were desirable , however , for the location function .
Project Manager was concerned about the power required and the cost . The robust voice recognition service embedded on the computer was exemplified by Project Manager to indicate that such software would drag and dictate , but would also require a lot of memory . Moreover , Project Manager admitted that voice recognition was fancy yet unfeasible within the budget .
Project Manager appreciated the idea of a joystick . An LCD menu screen on the joystick would consume quite low power . A fair amount of information could be read on the screen display . Other functionality would be associated inside the menu by traversing around . Project Manager agreed with User Interface that buttons could only be used for default functions such as volume adjusting and channel flipping once there was a functional joystick .
Project Manager thought that the interface design was still not intuitive and useful enough for now . Marketing agreed and pointed out that the present target group might be too large . Marketing suggested that the team should figure out specifically for whom they intended to design the interface in case the customers were confused about the remote control and got dissatisfied .
The group talked about the status of the first test set of digits data , naming conventions for files , speaker identification tags , and encoding files with details about the recording . The group also discussed a proposal for a grant from the NSF 's ITR ( Information Technology Research ) program , transcriptions , and efforts by speaker mn005 to detect speaker overlap using harmonicity-related features . Particular focus was paid to questions about transcription procedures , i.e . how to deal with overlooked backchannels , and audible breaths .
A small percentage of transcripts will be changed to reflect mis-read , uncorrected digits . A speaker database will be compiled to establish consistent links between speakers and their corresponding identification tags .
The first test set of digits is complete and includes 4,000 lines , each comprising between 1-10 digits . New digits forms were distributed for eliciting different prosodic groupings of numbers . New naming conventions were discussed as means for facilitating the sorting process . Existing files will be changed so that all filenames are of equal length . Similar changes will be made to speaker identification tags . Files will also contain information specifying channel , microphone , and broadcaster information .
The transcribers should only code audible breaths within a grouping of words , and not outside regions of continuous speech . It was further determined that audible breaths are an important facet of recorded speech , and that removing them from the corpus would be contrary to the aims of the project . Speaker mn005 will prepare his results for detecting speaker overlap and present them in the next meeting .
Transcribers are likely to overlook backchannels in densely populated sections of speaker overlap . Speaker mn014 reported that this is also problematic for the automatic detection of speech and non-speech , as backchannels that are very short and not loud enough will inevitably be overlooked . Speaker mn005 reported problems distinguishing between possible harmonics and other frequency peaks , and creating an algorithm for obtaining the instantaneous frequency . The encoding of all audible breaths is too time-consuming .
The whole meeting was focused on the target group and the functionality of the new remote control product . After Project Manager briefly reaffirmed the meeting procedure , Marketing , Industrial Designer , and User Interface each gave a presentation about trend-watching , working design , technical function respectively . Then , Project Manager started a group discussion about the demand for teletext and video , for which thick key design was accepted as a feasible solution . Then , the group discussed the target group based on the predetermined budget , and accepted universality as an important feature .
First of all , Project Manager launched a discussion about video over-demand , during which User Interface and Industrial Designer mentioned some fancy functions like downloading and streamlining . Then , Project Manager announced that according to the account manager , teletext could be included in the discussion , though its obsolescence incurred doubts over its usability and necessity . After that , Project Manager offered a choice question between television and further recording devices represented by DVDs , VCRs , and hard disk recorders . Finally , to cater for the younger people , User Interface devised big thick keys for RC in imitation of mobile phones , which received positive feedback from other team members .
Project Manager first brought up teletext as a well-known feature of televisions , but then admitted that it was becoming obsolete due to the development of the internet , though it was still used . Under this circumstance , Project Manager put forward two options , one of which was to stop at the television phase , and the other was to go further to the phase of the recording device . Then he started to talk about target customers in the first place and laid teletext issues on the table .
User Interface gained the inspiration of big thick keys for remote control from mobile phones , which were already skillfully used by the younger generation and thus made thick keys familiar to youngsters . Also , according to Marketing , compared with ordinary keys for RC , thick keys fitted in with the trend , especially among youngsters . Moreover , every team member agreed that with thick design , keys would look less cluttered and more spacious .
When Projected Manager announced that the group should decide on the target group , Marketing thought that with a tight budget , the functionality of the product would be greatly restricted . Hence , only a low market could be reached . However , after a brief discussion about LCR screen , Project Manager brought back the idea of universal remote control , and the group reached a consensus on the feasibility of designing a basic universal remote control at a low cost .
Marketing thought that remote control should be targeted at a low market . First , considering the tight budget , Marketing described the product as a cheap-end remote control , which would hardly gain the advantage over competitors in functionality . By saying that she implied that a high-end RC for a high market should be equipped with sophisticated functions , which were not possessed by a low-cost one anyway . Therefore , only a low market may want to buy it .
When Marketing first touched on the idea of a universal remote , she quickly rebutted herself , arguing that a high-end product was not achievable with a tight budget . However , Project Manager said that the group could make an attempt to provide a basic version of universal control , which could switch between stereo , VC , and TV . Thus , the group agreed to give universal remote a try and see if they could design a cheap one within budget .
The Project Manager gave a brief review of the team 's last meeting , then Industrial Designer , User Interface and Marketing gave their presentation each . Industrial Designer 's presentation is about the components and system of the remote control . User Interface gave the presentation about the design of the remote . The team agreed that there should be 17 buttons on the front of the remote and two on the back . Marketing 's presentation is about the research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . The team agreed that they could add a clap-back function to the remote .
User Interface preferred a more user-friendly remote with nice big buttons and limited number of buttons . She also gave her suggestions about the symbol and colour of the remote . Then , they discussed the number of buttons on the remote .
User Interface suggested that they could design the symbols and colours for the remote . However , the Project Manager reminded the team that they should put their own logo and colour scheme on the remote , which means that they could not design those things by themselves .
The team agreed that there should be 17 buttons on the remote , including number 0 to 9 , volume up and down , mute , channel up and down , stand-by and power buttons . Besides the buttons of brightness and contrast should be put on the back of the remote .
According to the research of Marketing , three quarters of the customers thought that their remotes are ugly . People only concentrated on the channel buttons , the volume buttons and the power buttons , and other buttons on the remote were seldom pressed . Many customers found it frustrating when their remotes were lost somewhere else in the room and they could n't find them . Besides , it was difficult for people to learn all the functions on the remote . Then the team discussed the idea of a speech recognition system for the remote .
Marketing suggested that the remote should be good looking and high-tech . And they should concentrate on the functions of changing channels and volumes . Besides , they could also think about using speech recognition as a way for people to find the remote control if it 's lost in a room .
Industrial Designer thought that the technology would be quite advanced and they might end up costing more than 25 budgets for speech recognition .
Meeting participants began by going over the logistics of recruiting participants , particularly through departmental mailing lists . They then moved onto discussing a new role , the instructor , who would help experimental participants figure out their intentions . This would eliminate a pre-written set of goals for the participants . Participants also discussed how the schema would incorporate other information , like choosing movies , and how more complex actions , like that of purchasing goods , could be incorporated into the source-path-goal schema . Finally , the participants concluded that an SPG schema of a different kind , one that can transfer previously acquired information , may be more helpful . The meeting concluded with the discussion of a new meeting time .
The new system for collecting subject intention focused on allowing subjects to come up with the intent themselves . Instead of giving them a list of goals , the subjects would , with the help of an instructor , figure out what they want to do in the environment . The earlier interaction with the instructor would give them a sense of how specific their goals in the environment could be . Another idea was to use pictures for people to help determine their intention , but the manufacturing of pictures seemed to be a very intensive project .
Grad C introduced the topic and explained that the new idea was to allow subjects to generate high level tasks , like going shopping , by themselves . Subjects would also be provided a high level schematic which would give them basic features of the environment . Though , the schematic would not contain detailed information , like a street map , which would be reserved for interactions with the wizard . An instructor would be hired to help subjects navigate the high level tasks .
Grad G learned that the materials would be based on real materials about Heidelberg and that the instructor would allow subjects to get a feel for the system 's capabilities . Grad G also learned that the interactions would be more natural .
The team wanted to figure out how roles would be connected to actions . The thought that their current XML schema forced the model to look up , requiring the whole body of the model . The new idea they came up with was to create a parallel intention oriented specification in addition to the pure schema , which would allow for a more flexible schema .
Grad C thought an approach in which the model had to refer to parents seemed inefficient . The model would constantly have to go back . Grad C wanted to completely redo it , even if it meant throwing away what the team had developed thus far .
This meeting was about the prototype presentation and evaluation . Firstly , the group presented the prototype with agreed features including a latex case in fruity colours that 's curved , push buttons with an on-screen menu button as well as eight extra buttons . Next , the group had a discussion about the prototype evaluation . They gave a high scale of the score on creativity , ease of use , integration of fruits as well as the simplicity . Also , they gave an average score on technology innovation and ease of learning . Then , the group agreed to set the target price at 12.5 Euros . Lastly , the group had a discussion about the project process , including management and leadership as well as group mates ' personal learning .
The group had an evaluation on the prototype after a presentation on it . They gave high scores in turns of product creativity , easy to use , integration of fruits , appropriate behaviour , simplicity and fashion . They gave a medium score in turns or technological innovation , ease of learning and not easy to lose .
Marketing thought the prototype was not much technologically innovative because they did n't have LCD screens and a fancy chip . While Project Manager thought the kinetic battery was a good innovation . The group supplemented that people might notice this feature after a year if they had n't changed the battery . So the group agreed to give an average of four out of seven .
Marketing firstly took the iPod as an example when illustrating the ease of learning the new remote . However , User Interface mentioned that it would be harder because users had to use the menu system and need to tell it what their favourite channels were . And it was a high learning curve , so User Interface gave four out of seven .
The group set the target price at 12.5 Euros and limited the cost under 12.5 Euros . So they agreed to use one kinetic battery , single electronics , single-curved rubber case with colour per unit and up to three colours . Also , they decided to have six buttons in one colour .
Industrial Designer thought they were making multiple varieties of button colours which made people confused . So Project Manager suggested that each unit would only have one colour on each button . To avoid confusion , the group agreed to have up to three colours for the buttons .
Industrial Designer suggested having buttons all in one colour and reduced to four . While Project Manager thought that six buttons were important and suggested having a single-curved and a simple chip to even out the product cost . The group agreed on it and they had a product price reduced to 12 Euros .
The meeting began with the harsh budget problem that the group had to cut down something of the current conceptual remote control , otherwise they would be unable to handle the cost . They talked about reducing the buttons , integrating functions , or using cheaper materials . After the discussion , the Marketing offered a questionnaire for the group to check if they were on the right track . Through the questionnaire , they found that it would be better if they paid more attention to the external design so the Industrial Design embellished the current design on the color and logo . As the last thing left to the meeting , the group reviewed their cooperation and got a general plan of their coming group presentation .
According to the Project Manager , the group had gone far beyond the budget , so they had to cut down something on the current conceptual remote design . The first idea they came up with was to reduce the number of the buttons . The Industrial Design proposed to use an integrating button to replace the scattered ones , but inevitably , this also had some defects . The User Interface focused on the material and he put forward to choose a cheaper material like wood or plastics . Paying attention to the energy consumption , the Marketing suggested using a hand dynamo to save the cost of batteries .
When discussing how to control their budget , the Industrial Design put forward to use an integrating joystick or a scroll-wheel push-button like the mouse to reduce the number of the buttons on the remote control . It did sound great for that it allowed users to function the remote control by manipulating only one button as well as saved the cost for the group . However , according to the User Interface , actually it could cost even five times to design and produce an integrating button than just produce several scattered buttons , so this might not be a feasible suggestion .
The User Interface suggested to use plastics as the material in order to reduce the cost . However , the Project Manager would like to use wood for fear that the color would not be bright enough . Fortunately , according to the User Interface , there were actually hard plastics with attractive color , that was also why he insisted on the plastics as the material .
As to have a clear idea about what they had already got , the Project Manager proposed to evaluate finished work first . Then through the review , they found the problem that the joystick might not function as well as they thought before . In addition , in order to keep it innovative , the group decided to add some unique things like fruit logos or make it in a three-D shape . According to the User Interface , they should put the electronics into fashions so the material also needed some discussion . Plastics and rubber were both fine to them for that they were not easy to be destroyed and favored by most youths . After all the discussions , the Marketing offered a questionnaire for them to check whether they made the right decisions .
When the group was talking about the material and function issue , the Marketing laid stress on the innovation for that they already had to drop several advanced techniques to meet the budget limitation and it was necessary for them to find something unique.He pointed out that they could take the advantage of the fruit and vegetable logos on the remote control , as well as the primary colors of the button .
When discussing whether they were on the right track after so many changes in their design , the Marketing offered a questionnaire for the group to check if they did the right thing . The questionnaire included both positive issues and negative ones , and by ticking all the questions on it , the group received a mark to evaluate their work as well as compare themselves to their counterparts . To the Project Manager 's satisfaction , the score eventually showed that they made the right decision and exceeded some others .
Members of the team discussed options to encode aspects of conversation that can not be captured through microphones . overlaps , as well as methods to deduce the length of pauses and the reasons behind them . This led to discussing how else to document the conversations , and archive each participant ’ s responses separately .
PhD G explained how the data represents the number of overlaps regardless of the number of speakers . It is important to answer the question of whether overlaps are distributed evenly throughout or whether they are in bursts . Anonymizing the results and classifying overlaps by type may assist in standardizing cultural ways of conversing . PhD G proposed finding the average length of overlaps and the distribution of the duration of overlaps .
Professor D said Switchboard does not allow for accurate recording of backchannels , especially with a smaller audience . Backchannels , which are the vast majority of overlaps in Switchboard do n't play as big a role online , because it 's unnatural to backchannel with a multi- person audience .
Postdoc F said or a control experiment , having a number of meetings with a smaller group of people may be useful . Since most of the meetings currently have between five and eight people , the control would have three person meetings .
Grad H has been experimenting with using the close - talking mike to decipher who is speaking . The first attempt was thresholding and filtering , which is very sensitive to the choice of filter width and threshold . It does allow for effective segmenting when someone 's talking and when they are not .
Project Manager began functional design meeting with reviewed last meeting and looked at new project requirements . The group did a presentation and made discussion about conceptual remote control design . They decided to use the LCD screen in the design as it was popular for the market and hard to damage . Because of the high price of LCD , the group put up a backup design with buttons instead of LCD as a solution . After group discussion , remote control would be designed with buttons shape and functions such as channels selection and speech recognition .
Industrial Designer designed remote control with handy size and made a connection with chips under the plastic of rubber button . Chip transmitted signal by Morse code which made infra-red lights signal could be sent to the TV . Industrial Designer prefered remote control with various colours so that it would be easy to use . On the other hand , Industrial Designer thought rubber buttons were easy to damage so they could make several designs .
Industrial Designer expressed initial working design about remote control . User Interface suggested that remote control should be user friendly with not too much but clear buttons . Marketing showed us data about functional requirement remote control . Project Manager said that the new requirement about remote control was teletext should be paid less attention as it was outdated . Future customers ' age should be focused on forty plus and new design should include corporate colour and slogan .
According to data , Marketing thought that younger people were more interested in features like LCD screen and speech recognition . However , older people did n't care about features so much and spent more money on remote control than younger people . Findings also showed that fifty percent of users lost remote control so bigger is better than smaller about remote control . Marketing expressed that volume button and channel button were the most important buttons so they should be found easily .
Project Manager said that remote control should only work with TV . Marketing thought the basics should be volume , channel and one till two zero numbers . Users Interface suggested remote control should with a button you can change from one number to two numbers .
Project Manage thought they should reach a market with customers that were younger than forty as they already had forty plus customers . Marketing suggested it should be sixteen to forty-five as they like the LCD screen most .
Industrial Designer thought if young people interested in LCD Team should make them . User Interface thought old people 's need should be taken into consideration . Like if old people could use an LCD screen . Marketing insisted market share for younger people is higher than older people so they should use LCD screens . Meanwhile , Marketing said if the LCD screen cost too much then they should change to rubber buttons . Project Manager agreed and hoped LCD would not be too expensive as they produced a lot .
Project Manager started meeting on the conceptual design of the remote control . Marketing gave a presentation on the preference of users which was easy to use with a fancy look . Also , Marketing suggested the remote control to be the shape of cool fruits with fewer buttons because they should target the young user group that would be keen on new device innovation . Next , User Interface presented on the sample of sensor speaker but did n't recommend it because it did n't add too much functional design and it was not mature to use it as a speech recognition engine . The group agreed with User Interface to have two scroll wheels with turbo button and switch on button . Then , Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the component design . The group decided to use a power source with spongy design and double curve chip for easy handling . Lastly , Project Manager helped conclude the features on the upcoming prototype presentation and asked group mates to prepare individually on it .
Marketing suggested the group to focus on a fancy look and feel more than the functionality of the remote design . Group mates asked if they would have a remote control in the shape of a banana . Marketing said they should not be attached to the trend because the trend next year would be different . So , Marketing suggested focusing on a young user group and designing a handy and cool remote .
Marketing suggested that the group should focus on young people because they are more open to new devices . And Marketing mentioned that 95 % of young people were able to buy a cooler remote control . User Interface asked if the fruit was cool . Marketing suggested they should think about the product in a cool shape . Nevertheless , User Interface suggested an easy-to-use shape . So the group recommended some fruit . Lastly , User Interface mentioned that they needed to have all the buttons with the device .
User Interface explained that the technology could recognize and train keywords in a certain order like a phrase . Project Manager asked User Interface whether it was just to playback something and was not really to do the control . User Interface supplemented that it could recognize a set target kind of word . So Project Manager thought this function is completely pointless from the interaction point of view .
User Interface suggested including the turbo button in scroll wheels and introduced that the turbo button was like a scroll wheel to scroll the past television stations without seeing what 's on them . Marketing asked about the speed whether it could be controlled . User Interface explained that users could skip over channels and know it was going fast or whatever . User Interface also suggested switch on and off buttons . Project Manager agreed to add one switch on button .
The group decided on the final prototype features to include extra functionalities such as scroll wheels , the speaker , and the base station that could fit a banana-shaped object . The group also agreed to need an RF to beep , wheels to control the volumes and channels , turbo button , and switch-on button . Besides , the group confirmed no LCD and ASR for the remote control .
The meeting mainly discussed the design of functions and the appearances . On function wise , the group had a little argument whether to make the product multi-functional or single functional . In the end they went with single-functional because it was more focused and affordable . They also removed some of the functions being discussed such as LCD screen , teletext and voice recognition , because they wanted to stick with a simplistic design . On design wise , the group finalized on the colour yellow as their product appearance and they chose illuminated buttons as one of their highlights . They also included some humanitarian factors into the design .
The industrial designer suggested that when taking environmental impact into consideration , the product could switch to a more environmental-friendly material . This type of material was made up of specific alloys of metals which have a shape memory , and it also allowed recycling . Hence , the product manager lifted out the point that the company could recycle the old remote controls from customers and take down the usable parts to make new remote controls . Even though the team liked the idea , the product manager also raised his concern towards the financial budget . In the end they agreed to discuss further about how they could achieve the idea by not exceeding the budget .
The user interface designer suggested two options of making the remote control functional . One way was to make it multi-functional , so as to be used for several entertainment devices . Another way was to make it single-functional , which could be used specifically for the television . The entire group preferred the product to be single-functional . It is because making an original design was more obtainable , and it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . They had to make it compatible with different brands of devices to sell internationally .
The marketing specialist did some research and the marking specialist stressed on the topic of appearance . To combine with the company ’ s motto , the marketing specialist believed in providing the international market with fashionable remote controls . And the statistics also showed that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Hence customers would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control .
It was discovered by the marketing specialist that people liked to switch channels , thus they had to make a more durable button . The marketing specialist counted the times of usage of every button on the remote control , and wanted to make a user-friendly banner to include all the buttons in . When including the buttons , they took in consideration the relevance and disadvantaged people as well .
The marketing specialist discovered that since a button would be too troublesome , a large percentage of the public would also like to pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . However , the project manager raised certain limitations of voice recognition function , and it also clashed with the intention of designing a simple product .
The marketing specialist suggested a LCD screen could be installed . The industrial designer thought it would be good to link with the teletext function . Also , the marketing specialist raised points about the target age group . In their assumption , a teenager would not be willing to pay for an expensive remote control , whereas the elder age group would be more willing . The group reached a consensus on catering the product to the age group of early twenties .
The project manager mentioned that they would love to incorporate the company ` s logo and colour into the product design , but it did not necessarily need to be the same colour . Since there was not a plan about which specific colour and logo to use , the industrial designer initiated the colour yellow and it was adopted .
Firstly , the team decided that the target functions of the remote control would just be for the television . Secondly , they removed functions that were previously discussed , such as teletext , LCD screen and voice recognition . Particularly for the teletext function , they were removing it because they were reaching out to an international crowd and some countries did have such things as teletext . They kept the alarm idea because it was not expensive to actualize .
The group agreed on making it small , but the findability was a problem . The user interface designer suggested that since the remote control was only linked to one TV set , it could stick to somewhere . And in order to reduce the size , the user interface designer further suggested that the remote control could charge within the socket , so it could obtain electricity which was provided from the TV ` s power source .
The group liked the fluorescent idea . The user interface designer suggested that since fluorescent lights lost their brightness after a certain time , the group could make this function tactile . They decided to make this function into little arrows that could be felt . They further debated on whether to use a battery to provide power or to use a naturally fluorescent material .
The group wanted the lighting up to be a faint glow , so that it would not cause a sudden explosion of light in a dim environment . At the same time , the glowing buttons would be made in the shape of numbers so that the vision-impaired people would be taken care of . Meanwhile , they wished the glow was in neon style so that they could implement the company 's colour in it and make it trendy .
The marketing specialist threw out the idea of making the remote control cover changeable and personalized . The marketing specialist further suggested that they could incorporate the TV theme elements such as Bart Simpson into the cover . However , it might raise a question about copyright issues so they decided to delay the discussion .
The meeting with Dr Frank Atherton , the Chief Medical Officer for Wales , and Nathan Cook , who is the head of the healthy and active branch at Welsh Government , was mainly about the 'Healthy Weight : Healthy Wales ' draft strategy in Wales and subsequent questions about it . To start with , Sian Gwenllian AM proposed questions like the strategy 's evaluation , investment and principal . Dr Frank Atherton , at the same time , indicated that there was a n exact evaluation and the nation has already imposed tax on sugar and the first Minister will definitely be the ultimate man at the wheel . Then they paid much attention to existing data measuring child obesity and decided to put it in great use in tackling obesity . Meanwhile , the meeting talked about government legislation for some sort of things like restricting price promotions and banning energy drinks , and sports infrastructure in schools as part of efforts to make a healthy environment . What 's more , they went into details on how healthy settings constructions and whom that would be the one to take responsibility . Also , they had a discussion on physical education and school meals for pupils . Finally , the meeting participants gave some supplements of education and the draft strategy and the chair concluded the meeting with the future universality of the draft strategy .
There was no exact evaluation but Dr Frank Atherton did think they should have a strong one . The draft strategy also made an estimate in investment which would be £8 million to £10 million a year . Investment would be spent on different sources and they should pay more attention to extending them . Speaking of leadership , Dr Frank Atherton agreed to its importance and made his own opinion that local leadership was essential and they should also have national oversight at the same time .
Having a target is more of its deliverability than just having it according to Dr Frank Atherton . Since there had been not that successful examples , Dr Frank Atherton considered that they must balance deliverability with challenge . Also , Dr Frank Atherton thought a target was one tool in the box that they could use , but moreover , an evaluation which could help them know where they are was very needed . At the same time , there was still a lot to achieve .
Investment needed to implement the plan was more about resourcing . Dr Frank Atherton said they currently did make investments in a number of areas that related to child health generally , and , of course , obesity and overweight in particular . And now , according to existing programmes , a figure of £8 million to £10 million a year had been bandied around as a broad kind of area of what they might need . Dr Frank Atherton also put priority in thinking about the totality of the £7 billion they spent in health and social care and how they could divert and channel some of that towards broad prevention initiatives in general , and towards tackling being overweight and obesity in particular .
There main data source was the child measurement programme , which collected information on children entering school aged four or five , showing that under a third of children at that age are overweight or obese . Dr Frank Atherton spoke of the frequency of being asked to have a longitudinal view over time of what 's happening to Children , which was obviously essential for our schools and for the system and helpful for the strategy evaluation .
Dr Frank Atherton first gave a very latest data showing that under a third of children at four or five are overweight or obese . The data showed that the situation was not getting radically worse but also not getting any better . They have a figure for the severely obese for the first time , which is about 12 per cent , which is quite shocking , in a way .
Dr Frank Atherton put out one “ often asked ” question and attached some importance to having a longitudinal view over time of what 's happening to Children , which meant children were measured at school entry and then again at age 11 or 12 . That would have significant resource implications , not just for the funding , but also for schools and for the system to deliver it . And also , according to Dr Frank Atherton , the longitudinal data would be helpful in strategy evaluation .
Dr Frank Atherton was first asked about legislations in the draft plan and their ideas on those things . The use of legislation was affirmed by Dr Frank Atherton but it was just one of the tools they have got , they need to employ them all . Then as to sports infrastructure , Dr Frank Atherton , though not an expert in that field , also supported it as a good one to pursue not only in schools but also in a broadening area .
According to Dr Frank Atherton 's answer to legislations ' timing , it was very clear that the implementation of legislation to build a healthy environment was very approved by Dr Frank Atherton and even by a large group in the consultation . Dr Frank Atherton reviewed that they needed a mirror to see what had been happening in this country and legislation was a good way and took some examples of food takeaways which showed that they needed to consider effectiveness things .
Dawn Bowden AM asked for Dr Frank Atherton 's ideas on community sport infrastructure of new schools , and pointed out that Welsh Government has ploughed a huge amount of money into the twenty-first century schools programme . At the end of speech , Dawn Bowden AM thought they should be making sure that they have those kinds of facilities so that they become accessible to the wider public . At the same time , Dawn Bowden AM gave advice on making a recommendation of sports infrastructure to Dr Frank Atherton .
Dr Frank Atherton first gave a look at a primary school education embedded with physical activity at an early stage and assures its benefits not only on healthy benefits but also on socialization and mental issues . Then Dr Frank Atherton delivered sparkles on making pupils more engaged with physical education , which was tailoring things to different audiences . When it came to school meals , Dr Frank Atherton did not gave personal views because things related still needed more consultations and surveys .
Dr Frank Atherton considered that just in terms of the physical activity , it was a really important dimension and they found that their children were not that physically active and could n't meet the various guidelines . Embedding physical activity at an early stage in primary school education might not have the same effect as the dietary issue did to healthy weight , but it was vital to pupils socialization and mental health .
In fact , Dr Frank Atherton did not give an exact opinion on providing a more varied diet for pupils . It would be something needing consultation and consideration , then they might decide whether it was worth carrying out . The quality of food , rather than preparing school meals or not , was more important to Dr Frank Atherton .
The meeting included an introduction to the project , the mechanics of training the data , standardizing the data for the models , the time involved , and planning efficient use of computational resources . The team members shared and discussed the existing model as well as the tests they intended to run . There was a problem standardizing labels as well as converting HTK labels to the format that the team wanted . Adding more dimensions to the current model was also causing concern because of the upper bound on computational resources .
The team was gathering data from different languages and preparing relevant baselines . The professor reiterated that the multilingual focus was key since the reason for this project was to replace mel cepstra with a more robust , multilingual model . They needed sufficient diversity in the languages they used .
Grad G thought that the multi-lingual aspect of the model was not very important . The professor disagreed . He explained that the point of the project was to have something robust that could apply to many languages .
The team arrived at the conclusion that they only needed sufficient breadth , not every possible language . As long as most languages used over cellular phones were covered , they were fine . The similarity between different languages would help them cover more ground with fewer languages .
The Spanish data was not in the desired HTK format and needed to be processed , which was turning into somewhat of a challenge . The team also realized that moving data was making their processes slower and they needed to rely on faster machines to complete their tasks . The team discussed various linguistic features and computational methods for linguistic analysis that they could incorporate .
The professor expressed that copying the information between drives clogged the network and slowed down their task . Though , the team was getting four more 36 GB drives . The professor also wanted to get more information on space available on computational servers .
The team thought that doing a cheating experiment , where they try to identify the most important features , would be useful . Even if the results were not as great as they expected them to be , it could still be a valuable addition to their work . They thought that they could normalize the features using a sigmoid and try this for their work .
The main focus of the meeting was firstly on the structure of the belief-net , its decision nodes and the parameters that influence them , and secondly , on the design of the data collection tasks . For the latter , there are already 30 subjects lined up and more are expected to be recruited off campus . Finally , as to the semantic and syntactic constructions , work will start with more general and brief descriptions , before moving to exhaustive analysis of at least a subset . Similarly , the construction parser that is to be built within a year is expected to be relatively basic , yet robust .
The team discussed that the organisation of the intermediate nodes of the belief-net and their properties is almost complete , although no conditional probabilities have been inserted yet . These nodes represent decisions that will function as parameters to action calls in the system . Their values will either be inferred from the user-system interaction , or -as a last resort- requested directly from the user .
A detailed diagram of the EVA belief-net was presented and some of the intermediate nodes and their properties were discussed in depth . Some of the key features and properties are : `` Go-there '' , which is binary , and defined by the user , situation , ontology and discourse models ; `` timing '' ( current/next tour ) ; `` reason '' ( business , sight-seeing , socialising ) ; `` transport '' ; `` length of tour '' ; `` costs '' ; `` entity '' ( open , accessible ) etc .
There are already 30 subjects lined up and more are expected to be recruited off campus . It was agreed that making subjects select from categories of tasks , such as `` big place '' , `` service '' , etc . could provide a better range of data . The duration of each dialogue will probably be no more than 10 minutes .
The data collection that will provide relevant dialogues is moving along , with thirty subjects already lined up . They will be given a reading task , which will include some german proper names , and a series of tasks from the tourist domain to choose from . In order to get directions , they will then communicate with a computer system and a human operator , using a sketchy map as an aid . A different set of data are already available from the SmartKom system and similar sources .
A curriculum reform was to carry out throughout Wales . The group discussed with Estyn about the obstacles and difficulties faced by secondary schools when bringing the reform into practice , such as teacher shortage and lack of funds , and how Estyn tackled them . Then the council questioned Estyn over their inspection over local authorities ' educational services including regional consortia and independent schools . In addition , the group also talked about specific skill development of literacy and numeracy , concluding that literacy should be the top priority of the progress . They also dug into concerns regarding students ' economic background and the schools ' ability to care for students ' mental well-being .
First of all , although a number of primary schools have surplus funds , still a lot of secondary schools are in deficit and low on funds . Also recent years have seen a shortage of teachers with appropriate initial teacher training . There are concerns as well that schools in the bottom layer may find it difficult to adapt to the new curriculum and have little improvement on teaching quality .
Meilyr Rowlands thought it was a challenge to recruit new teachers and improve the initial training.In the long term , he believed that education should become more attractive for young people and more mature people to go into , while in the short term , looking at initial teacher training would be the top priority .
The children in secondary schools themselves are older and therefore have greater challenges . As a result , it 's also more difficult to engage with the parents of older children than younger children .
There were 12 percent of secondary schools under Estonian review and 11 percent of them were in special measures . He worried that these schools lacked enough support and fundings to adapt to the new curriculum reform and face greater difficulties .
Jassa Scott believed they had prioritized the work that schools were doing around literacy and numeracy , yet the support for schools to develop digital competence were a bit weaker . Also their support for secondary schools had less impact across the consortia than for primary schools .
They agreed that the first area they would look specifically at would be the work of consortia to support curriculum work . Local government legislation were also under debate , which was an opportunity to adapt the inspection to look specifically at their work .
She held the view that children aged 3-5 were often introduced to things too early when they 're not at that developmental stage . As a result , in the long term children would lose confidence with a lot of negative impressions .
He believed literacy still needed to be the top priority , because it was something that underpinned the rest of education . Yet work was still needed to be done to continue prioritizing it .
Meilyr Rowlands thought it was a fairly clear good news to see the improvements on the PISA results in maths , which could be attributed to the new GCSE mathematics numeracy . Also they agreed it was a good news story to see much more mathematics knowledge to be applied in a problem-solving situation . With regard to the effects of schools , Meilyr Rowlands held that the school had a larger effect on mathematics and science than reading .
There was a two-pronged approach to solve the problem . One is the new curriculum , which was all about improving the quality of teaching and learning in the classroom . Poor pupils could gain more from it than their peers . The other one was to have a community-focused approach to schools through helping the pupils and their families .
Because they had to make sure that more able and talented children do well , who are mainly from poor backgrounds .
First of all , secondary school pupils got to notice the differences between their everyday life at school and somehow felt not cared about . It was also more of a challenge for a secondary school to provide an effective set of support from that whole-staff awareness of some of the challenges . That is to say , it was more difficult for teachers in secondary schools to pick up signs that pupils may be struggling .
The group discussed digits data , recent ASR results , the status of transcriptions , and disk space and storage format issues . Approximately two hours of digits have been recorded , half of which have been extracted . Researchers doing ASR are looking into methods for generating a better channel-based segmentation to improve recognition results for close-talking microphone data . Transcription checking procedures were reviewed , and efforts to coordinate the channelization and presegmention of data with the tightening of time bins were discussed . The group also talked about downsampling and strategies for coping with low disk space .
Digits forms will instruct speakers to read digits separately and not as connected numbers . A tentative decision was made to collect overlapping digits from speakers .
A test set of digits data totalling two hours is nearly complete . Digit extraction has been performed on roughly half of this data
Future work may involve experimenting with the reading of digits in different prosodic groupings .
Transcription checking procedures were reviewed , and efforts to coordinate the channelization and presegmention of data with the tightening of time bins were discussed .
Transcribers will be given channelized data that has been segmented for speech/non-speech boundaries to determine whether such pre-processing facilitates the transcription process .
Transcription checking procedures have been formalized , including a spell check , producing an exhaustive list of forms identified in the data , attributing every utterance to the appropriate speaker ID , glossing spoken forms with their full orthographic counterparts , e.g . 'cuz ' and 'because ' , transcribing acronyms , and encoding comments , i.e . glosses , vocalic and non-vocalic non-speech events , pragmatic cues , and the standardization of spoken forms , e.g . 'mm-hmm ' .
The main topics of the agenda were a paper submitted to Eurospeech and the organising of the recording transcriptions to be done by IBM . The results presented in the former show a significant percentage of overlapping speech even without counting in backchanneling . Regarding the transcriptions to be carried out by IBM , the discussion mainly concerned the format of the recordings that should be sent to them . Suggestions included sending only the channels with the dominant speakers for transcription , but it was finally agreed on sending the original files with minimal modifications , as there will be extensive in-house post-processing .
There is a slight worry about the acceptance of the paper submitted to Eurospeech as the deadline was exceeded .
As to the content of the paper , the overlap statistics have not been normalised against the number of participants in the conversation , although the dependency is probably going to be a weak one . Additionally , the correlation between pauses in speech and interruptions does not provide a cause-and-effect link for these phenomena .
The statistics in the paper are based on the transcripts of two meetings and two telephone conversation corpora . In the first two , the overlapped words vary between 9 % and 18 % . The telephone conversation results were in-between and very similar to each other .
Before that , the files will be automatically pre-segmented into speech/non-speech bins and the beeps will be inserted .
In order to make things easier for the transcribers , breathy channels , which are erroneously marked as speech , will be re-classified correctly with other methods .
The preparation of files for transcription by IBM is facing some minor difficulties , as some features ( hand-coded time boundaries , multiplicity of channels etc ) may complicate the generation of beep files .
The meeting began with a short introduction to Hans Guenter , who was arriving soon and would be visiting for a few weeks . The team then discussed integrating mean log magnitude spectral subtraction into the SmartKom system . It seemed , however , that lengthening the time for this task was not very effective . The team also learned more about Wiener filtering which worked well when mixed with other approaches . It was almost as effective as the best systems . The team then delved into spectral subtraction and discussed the various ways in which it could be refined . The meeting ended with comments on the additional latency that was caused by this method .
The log magnitude spectral subtraction used twelve seconds from the past and future to calculate the mean . The short window did not have a big effect on the model performance , which was much desired . The silence , for the most part , had been cut out to make the model more effective . The professor added that the system was similar to caching utterances .
The professor suggested that the model essentially improved performance after the first utterance as it had more data . There was a higher error probability for the first utterance . This issue could potentially be resolved using a second-pass system , in which the initial utterance was processed differently .
Grad E thought that the idea of doing mean log magnitude spectral subtraction was figuring out the effect of training time on the model performance . It seemed that longer times had diminishing returns after a certain point .
PhD D informed the team that there was additional latency in the system with spectral subtraction . The professor wanted the team to be cognizant of the latency . The team suggested a spectral whitening approach or using a probability focused approach to solve the problem .
The professor wanted to make sure that the team does not end up in a bind . If they later had to cut latency , it would create a problem . This was his preferred conservative approach .
The latency of the recursion was fifty milliseconds . The recursion added that much to the overall latency of the system . Though , PhD B suggested doing tasks in parallel to reduce total latency .
The group met to decide which features were desired by users and to decide how to design the shape and appearance of the remote control . Marketing and User Interface presented on what features were desired by remote control users , and Industrial Designer presented on the required internal components of a remote control . They decided not to pursue speech recognition and settled on designing a rounded one-handed remote control with minimal buttons .
The group decided that speech recognition appeals to mostly younger people . The team decided speech recognition is mostly just a gimmick and is not used unless it works very well .
Marketing agreed that speech recognition gets old and is a gimmick . Marketing also thought that since younger people are not the consumers spending money on remotes their preference for speech recognition might not matter greatly .
According to Marketing 's research , ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they would spend more money to buy a remote with speech recognition .
Marketing presented the results of interviews conducted with remote control users . Eighty percent of users indicated that they would be willing to pay more for a remote that looked fancier . Fifty percent of users indicated that they generally only use about ten percent of the buttons on their remote controls . User Interface then presented the difficulties of a universal remote and also mentioned that few buttons are needed frequently by users .
Marketing thought that making the remote look cool and modern was important . Marketing also thought that many buttons could be removed or combined . Marketing also thought a tracking device and speech recognition could be good ideas .
Marketing and User Interface agreed on the importance of fewer buttons for a user-centered remote . Marketing and User Interface also agreed on the importance of the appearance of a remote control .
The conference is about an inquiry into targeted funding to improve educational outcomes in the Wales education system . First , they primarily discussed the Pupil Development Grant , its targeting , eligibility , use and impact . Then , the group discussed care of looked-after children and adopted children . They discussed the condition and impact of another student support program the Schools Challenge Cymru program and the advisory role of regional consortia , Cabinet Secretary .
According to Kirsty Williams , when it comes to individual interventions , those individual interventions of PDG should only be targeted at those children who are eligible for free school meals ; but in some cases , schools may use their PDG funding to provide a universal intervention . One of the things that they 've used PDG for is the focus on the concept of growth mindset in school , a universal thing that they 've trained all the teachers in . There are some other ways to drive the potential of talented and able children , like the example of `` a window on the world bus '' paid for by schools .
According to Kirsty Williams , it 's probably the best that they 've got at present , and will continue to have discussions with local government about whether there are different ways . Officials are working all the time in conjunction with the department in England , to understand their thinking in this area so that we are in a position to make some decisions about what a notional eligibility for free school meals will look like going forward , but before I make any decisions , I want to assure everybody that there will be a full public consultation on that .
As identified by Estyn , most schools are using this money to good effect . When PDG first started , in some schools it was spent on investing in tracking children , because they had never thought about tracking these children , they did n't have systems in place to look at the performance of these children and to have a system in place . Now they have moved from spending money on the infrastructure around support for FSM children into actual inputs in terms of teaching and learning . And they have appointed regional PDG advisers to better deploy the fund .
Over the period of the last inspection report , they have seen improvements in attendance , but still need to look at again how PDG can support this particular agenda . There are some excellent examples of how schools use the money to address this , some schools send the staff out and create walking buses , so that they walk the children into the school . Despite these good measures , there is still a gap between the attendance of free-school-meal pupils and non-free-school-meal pupils . It gets more challenging the older the children get .
According to Kirsty Williams , there is no specific answer . There 's no single reason why there seems to be less resilience in this cohort of children . They think that they ca n't draw broad-brush conclusions . The challenge is to go into individual schools and understand what was happening in that particular school that ensured that their children did really well . They continue to have discussions with Qualifications Wales to get a better understanding of this , and in May , they 'll be doing a deep dive into this particular subject .
The most awareness around PDG is around free school meals , and there is less awareness around the availability of PDG to support looked-after children . In the nature of the cohort , there are more children subject to free school meals than are subject to being looked after . The thinking behind that at the time was around a greater strategic deployment of that resource and to try and drive a greater impact than how it was being used previously , so the looked-after PDG is held at a regional level .
They believe that if they can get it right for our most vulnerable learners , they 'll be getting it right for all of our learners . An emerging theme is the impact , the growing awareness and the growing numbers of children who have attachment disorder , and how schools are best able to respond to that in their children . So , vulnerable learners , regardless of their background , will benefit from having teachers who are better trained , understanding and have intervention strategies in place to be able to address that need . And this is an action applied across four regions .
According to Kirsty Williams , they are actively looking at whether they should try and find a way of collecting this data . They ca n't force parents to divulge information that is a matter for them . But there is an active discussion going on at the moment about whether they could create a dataset where people divulge this information and we can then track the children through . They ca n't see the educational attainment of looked-after children just being a job of education . It has to be a job of social services and the health service as well .
According to Kirsty Williams , people should look at exclusions and also have to read across about how the whole system works , not just the PDG element of the system . 66 % of looked-after learners have some additional learning need , so they ca n't just look at it in terms of this particular source of funding . It ca n't be just the job of the PDG .
They are looking at systems and processes , the placement of comprehensive systems of tracking and processes within the school . They are looking at the teacher quality — how can they ensure that we have got consistent strategies in place to drive up pedagogy and teacher quality in the classroom . And also , collaborative activity . One of the key themes of the national mission is a self-improving system , so collaborative working is necessary where schools are looking outside of each other , learning from best practice from other schools .
Some of the Schools Challenge Cymru schools are making sustained improvement now that the programme has come to an end . Like the example of Tredegar , where we have seen continual improvement and moving up through the categorisation system . The challenge is for those schools that Schools Challenge Cymru did n't work for , and they have n't seen the progress of how to use the school improvement system now to continue to work with those schools . So now the focus is a whole-system approach , rather than choosing 39 schools to get that level of support . Schools Challenge Cymru would probably need about five years to really have the impact that it was intended to have .
According to Kirsty Williams , she expects their challenge and support advisers to be having conversations that they need to have when they are with that school , to know about how they are using their PDG , and how they 're demonstrating an impact for those resources . It 's a fundamental role for the challenge and support advisers in the regional consortia in their school improvement work .
Kirsty Williams thinks that it 's absolutely crucial that we track performance . Where they were n't tracking pupils at all , initial investment in PDG was used to establish these systems within schools . One of the outcomes from the schools challenge review , and one of the lessons learnt was the importance of individual tracking of pupils throughout their school career . But they ca n't dictate a single system .
This meeting was about conceptual design . Firstly , groupmates had three presentations on components , trend watching , and interface contents . Their target age group was below forty , so they suggested personal preferences on the remote , like the material , the battery , the speech recognition technology , etc . Then , they discussed the trendy features and decided to include parental control as well as the gaming features in the remote control . Finally , Project Manager shared some master class knowledge with group mates and suggested applying a marketing campaign , large provider marketing approach , and real reaction product idea .
Firstly , Industrial Designer presented components based on the target age group 's preference for stylish and material , including energy , chip , and LCD . Next , Marketing presented market trends and suggested the group should focus on the main audience and use fresh colours , rubber materials , speech function , and the log-in functionality with the slogan . Then , User Interface presented on interface contents and suggested a big touch screen , a program menu with volume plus and minus .
Marketing suggested the second personal preference from the market trend was to consider technology innovation , including the speech function recognition and the link with mobile phones . The reasons were that the market was screaming for new technologies and users could use remote to do something else , like gaming , when parents were watching some boring program .
Industrial Designer asked about whether group mates choose battery or kinetic . User Interface suggested that they could use the kinetic as a back-up . Marketing supplemented that it could be a combination . So , Industrial Designer concluded that they could use the battery and charge it up with kinetic . Group mates agreed on it .
Group mates agreed that they could incorporate the parental control as well as the gaming features into the remote control . However , they would discard the idea of voice recognition because it would be too much for the remote feature .
When the group suggested having the implementation of parents ' log-on screen in the remote , Industrial Designer thought it would be not worth investing much time and effort to program . However , Project manager disagreed with this because there would be a huge market for parental control when they heard from magazines that many parents thought their children were influenced by televisions . Also , Project Manager mentioned that their target group was below forty , and lots of families had children at a young age .
Marketing suggested building an expert view and a simple view for handy consideration . User Interface suggested that in the menu structure , they could push system properties so that the entire list would pop up for programming . Industrial Designer supplemented that they could build in a back-forward button if someone wanted to watch fewer channels .
The team was setting up a new project in which they would record meetings and then generate summaries . The meeting began with introductions and a discussion of what kind of data the team could collect . They considered collecting visual data as well as notes . At the end of the meetings , the team wanted to ask participants to summarize what they took away as well as ask questions about the meeting . This would be a method for collecting more data to train a potential summarization model . One concern the team had was how they could reduce bias when collecting queries . Words like `` important '' could skew participant responses . The team also expressed some interest in collecting action items . Finally , the team discussed what each member should do to get the project up and running and the role of diversity in their data set .
The team wanted to think about how they would generate queries . One method was directly generating queries from the summaries , though the concern was that this would not be very desirable . Asking an open ended question about what was most interesting would allow the team to get a sense of the important topics .
PhD F thought that it would be interesting to generate queries from the summaries , as that would open up a new area of research . PhD F realized that this may not be feasible , however .
PhD B thought generating queries went beyond the score of the project and that Landay was more equipped to handle a project like that . Though , PhD B recognized the flaw with people generating queries from the summaries
The team thought it would be worthwhile to get different sorts of meeting data . Meetings will vary in mic placement , speaker sound overlap , and style . Even the dominance relationships in the meetings would cause variance in the data . Some members also wanted to gather TV and radio data .
PhD B explained the different features of meetings and favored collection of diverse data . PhD B thought the team 's data collection could focus on natural meetings , but there was no reason to not incorporate other data .
The team knew that the CMU folks had collected a lot of data , but they were not sure if it was publicly available . It seemed that there was politics involved . The team thought that they could let Mark see if CMU would let them use the data .
This meeting talked about the conceptual design of the remote control product . Industrial Designer gave the first presentation , stating the personal preference for components designs . User Interface delivered the second . It led to a following discussion about basic function types as well as the size of their buttons . Next , Marketing 's presentation identified the three most important aspects of remote design and expressed the focus on the trend on the elder market . As such , the group started to discuss how to meet the satisfaction of different age markets with the design . After that , Project Manager steered the meeting to further questions , including technical functions , material , color design , buttons functionality , and docking station design .
Industrial Designer made a presentation about the personal preference for components design . The remote should have a solid case in plastic and soft rubber and the rubber push-buttons . As for the energy source , the basic battery was better because it was more convenient for remote control users . As for the chip , the simple electronic chip should be available with an LED transmitter . Next , the group came to discuss the possibility of LCDs that had been noted .
Project Manager thought the skip buttons and the volume buttons , the two most basic functions , should be designed larger . In this way , the simplicity of the remote could also be accentuated .
Marketing indicated the three most important findings : fancy look-and-feel , innovative technology , and high ease of use . As the fruits and vegetable theme and sponge material remained trendy that year , the group turned to discuss how to combine the fancy themes with the design and find a proper balance between the elder market and the young market , the specific topics including the color design , the possibility of related symbol and pictures , and the location of business logo .
Industrial Designer wanted an LCD that could be applied to show program information , which was also trendy if colored . However , this idea was disagreed by other group members for the following reasons . First , a big LCD screen was too expensive . Second , most users read the information on TV and the Internet instead of the remote . Next , LCD had a vulnerable feature and was also too functional to match the basic design concept . Moreover , for User Interface suggested that the design required only one specialty , LCD was not that necessary when the group had already decided on the docking station .
Project Manager thought titanium was considerable and mentioned several possibilities , such as the complete titanium design that was trendy . User Interface disagreed , pointing out that titanium was used even more than plastic . Other shortages considered included making users ' hands a bit sweaty and becoming quite cold in winter .
The group decided to have only the basic function buttons , including numbers button , power button , skip button , volume button , mute button , teletext button , and menu button .
The meeting of the standing committee took place to discuss matters pertinent to the Coronavirus pandemic . The main issue at stake was to ensure that the government was doing everything in its power to assist vulnerable Canadians during the pandemic , as well as to help reopen the economy . While many discussions focused on temporary assistance that the government could provide during the pandemic , like a $ 25 weekly bump in old-age security , some discussions talked about the intersection of these programs with general social welfare initiatives , like reducing homelessness and poverty . Canada 's agricultural and fishing economy was highlighted as one of the industries in the greatest need for stimulus . Conservative ministers tried to bring attention to the government 's recent gun control laws .
The Chair brought the meeting to order , announcing that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss COVID-19 's impact on Canada . Five petitions were presented : to recognize indeginous languages as official languages of Canada , to improve the organ donation system , to push for a made-in-Canada green economy , to decriminalize drug possession to improve public health , and to protect firearm ownership of law-abiding firearm owners . Mr. Pierre Paul-Hus suggested that the government should not try to pass gun-control legislation or release prisoners during the pandemic . The Prime Minister disagreed , claiming that both passing gun-control and releasing imprisoned Canadians who did not pose a threat to society advanced the safety of Canadians .
Mr. Paul-Hus thought that the government should not take firearms away from law-abiding Canadian citizens . He inquired into how the government would take guns from criminals . He also expressed concern about the quick release of dangerous criminals during the pandemic and China 's intransparency with regards to the pandemic .
The Prime Minister disagreed with Mr. Paul-Hus . He expressed that he had a mandate from the last election campaign to ban military-style assault weapons , and expressed disappointment about Conservatives ' not wanting to do the same . He also claimed that speedy releases of inmates were governed by strict rules and were important to ensure that correctional services were protected from the virus .
Members expressed concern that pandemic related restrictions were harming businesses and that the government was not reopening businesses and providing stimulus in an effective fashion . Emphasis was placed on reopening fishing , restoring agricultural supply chains , and supporting farmers . Many members inquired as to why the government had only furnished $ 252 million of the promised $ 2.6 billion fund to maintain food security in Canada .
Ms. McPherson wanted to know how the government will respond to outbreaks in meat-packing plants since workers ' pleas to place effective safety protocols have been fruitless . She further inquired if the federal government would provide financial support to the workers if they declined to work under unsafe conditions , and , if it comes to it , shut down the plants . She finally wanted to know if the Cargill business , which uses Luxembourg as a tax haven , was the recipient of pandemic relief funds .
Hon . Chrystia Freeland was thankful for the farmers who worked hard to feed the country and was pleased that partisanship had been pushed aside to fight the coronavirus . She stood by the idea that no Canadian should have to work in an unsafe environment and put her trust in the Food Inspection Agency to regulate working conditions .
This was the second meeting with functional design discussion purpose . Firstly , the group gave three individual presentations on working design , technical functions and functional requirements . They mentioned the importance of the fancy appeal , the practicality and the quality of components . Then , the group had a discussion about general requirements on the remote control . The group decided to market the remote as a separate product and focused on the user-friendly as well as simplicity , instead of too much technological advancement . Also , they agreed to target on income group and would add extra functionalities like keep lost and rechargeable stations for the remote control .
The first presentation was about users ' functional requirements . Marketing mentioned that 80 % of people like fancy appeal remote and younger people prefer voice recognition . The second presentation was about technical functions . User Interface suggested that as a communication tool , the remote should be practical and ergonomically designed . The third presentation was about working design . Industrial Designer introduced four main components , like a battery to make it work , the chip to convert the data , the user that 's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that moves the data to the receiver .
Marketing was asking what RSI was when mentioning the user needs to be easy to use . User Interface answered that it was repetitive strain injury . So Marketing denied this function because it did not match people 's operating behaviour and users wanted a remote control with fewer buttons which would be easy to learn . Just like the audio setting was not given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that 's used a lot more often .
When Industrial Designer demonstrated two different remote controls , Project Manager thought neither of them was pretty . Mentioning about the cool look about the functional design , Industrial Designer suggested taking consideration of the cool appeal into the selling point of fashion remote because there was a market for cool looking technology and ergonomic design .
The group agreed to target 15 to 25 year olds . They decided to make the remote look simple , but have the key buttons to make it easy to use . Also , groupmates agreed to use one menu button and they would include voice recognition as one option .
Project Manager mentioned that they should emphasize on making the infra-red more functional . Industrial Designer thought the chip took the data and presented it without sort of scattering and the quality of all the components really mattered . Then Project Manager mentioned the target group and voice recognition was not necessary . Group mates agreed on it and mentioned that it was high-tech and expensive .
Industrial Designer suggested a rechargeable station like a cradle for the iPod when discussing the battery for essential functions because it might contribute to fewer people losing it too if it stayed in one place . Project Manager agreed and suggested thinking about the space in the living room as well when designing this feature .
Firstly , Project Manager reviewed the overall process that the team designed the remote control that they had viewed the fashion trends and incorporated the key features . After that , User Interface introduced the prototype of remote control based on the previous discussion of its function . The prototype was yellow like a banana with a simplest quick on-off button and could be used both-handed . Secondly , Marketing designed an evaluation test according to criteria found of the market trend as well as the customers ' complaints and the team gave one to seven points to the shape , colour , material , controls and functions of the product . Thirdly , the team found that the current product exceeded the budget , so the team decided to completely discard the single button and LCD . Lastly , the team gave positive feedback on the project and the process .
Project Manager introduced that the prototype incorporated fashion trends that people prefer fancy looking products like fruit and vegetable . After That , User Interface presented the product which looked like a banana and was bright yellow except for the blue button . The style was as simple as possible in order to fit the customers ' need for simplicity . Also , the product could be curved and used both-handed with advanced chips hidden inside , which seemed quite creative and identical to iPod features . In the end , Industrial Designer commented that the remote control could be smaller in size .
Marketing had some evaluation criteria in mind , based on previous marketing strategy , on the latest trends , and on user preferences . The team should figure out whether their product could solve the complaints of the ugly remote control . There was a seven-point scale rating for each criterion . The team would give comments to each feature listed and agree on the final rating .
Generally speaking , the team agreed that the product was intuitive and had successfully incorporated main aims that the team had . The team believed the customers were not likely to lose the remote control since it was big and bright yellow with speech recognition . Moreover , Industrial Designer suggested adding an extra feature for the product to raise volume like hell when it was removed so far from the TV . However , the team also noted that costs should be compared when deciding to use annoying alarms or others .
To start with , the team agreed that the remote control was indeed innovative with the LCD display incorporated and the way it could be used both-handed with an alarming feature . Also , it aimed at the recent fashion trend since it looked like a banana with a special yellow colour . Although some of its features were identical to an iPod , the team believed that it was a creative design for remote control .
Project Manager first introduced the budget and broke it down to parts like batteries , electronics , case material supplements , interface type and then button supplements . The team agreed that the push button , integrated scroll-wheel and the LCD display cost a lot but case materials were all the same . In this case , the team decided to discard the LCD since the information it could transmit could also be simply displayed on the screen . As for the recognition feature , the team decided to make it a big deal to be alarming . And lastly , the product would be pure yellow instead of a blue button .
The team thought they had a really great team work experience . Everyone had put efforts into the process and gave opinions to design a good remote control . Also , the process incorporated different stages and new ideas could always be added based on the market finds .
The discussion in this meeting focused on detailed design . First of all , the prototype was presented , which was pretty much like what the group had agreed before , including the yellow colour , cover and buttons made by rubber , etc . However , what they had exceeded their expected budget . Therefore , they had discussions on which features were okay to be taken out . They finally agreed on removing speech recognition , and the special colour . Then they did an evaluation of their product , and overall they did well . To sum up this teamwork experience , the Project Manager emphasized the importance of the communications . At last , they had a discussion on the product name , and agreed on `` triple R '' .
They all agreed that speech recognition could be taken out , because LCD had more support on the customer side , and it did not give an extra function compared to other normal remote controls . As for the special colour , they had some disagreements initially , since User Interface thought it could not reflect the current trend anymore if it was taken out . However , after evaluating dropping other features such as rubber or curve , they agreed that both of them brought more advantages than the special colour . Besides , the colour could be made up by using special covers .
Project Manager thought speech recognition was the first option to be scrapped . Project Manager made this decision according to the feedback from customers . Around ninety percent of people preferred an LCD display , while only sixty percent of people wanted speech recognition .
Industrial Designer proposed to give up the curve , but other people argued that the remote control would turn into something ordinary and be a straightforward remote control . Project Manager thought it would be a good idea to separate their product from the rest of the remote control world . Therefore , they decided to keep the curve .
They drafted several potential product names , including `` banana '' , `` RC deluxe '' , `` real reactor '' , `` triple RC '' , etc . They concentrated on adjusting the `` triple RC '' , and eventually decided on `` triple R '' . The group thought this name was cool , and especially looked cool when it was printed in the front , and it was catchy .
`` Triple RC '' made the product look like a triple remote control , but it was only a single remote control . In addition , the important part was triple R anyway , Real Reaction Remote . Therefore , they decided to drop C from this name , and just keep `` triple R '' .
They agreed to cross out 'banana remote ' , 'the deluxe ' from the options . They all agreed on the 'triple R ' without arguments , because the group thought it looked cool when it was printed out . In addition , it was short and catchy .
Project Manager started meeting on the detailed design of the remote control . User Interface and Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the prototype with a banana leaf base station and a hand-sized remote with two scroll wheels , the turbo button , the teletext button , the calling button , the rechargeable-batteries power source , and the speaker regular chip . Next , the group evaluated based on Marketing 's list of user requirement criteria . Then , groupmates discussed the cost estimation , including the component production cost . They agreed to use plastic instead of rubber material for the dual chips . Also , they agreed not to use LCD and no button supplements to avoid over budget . Lastly , the group discussed the project process . The group agreed they had creativity , while User Interface suggested that they should find out more target markets . Besides , Project Manager suggested doing a street survey . Also , User Interface suggested that they could simplify the interface and the circuit board .
User Interface and Industrial Designer firstly presented on the prototype features which agreed to have a banana shape with a size that fitted to the hand . Also , they showed the prototype with a leaf base station with a calling button to locate the remote control . As agreed by the group , the prototype would have two scroll wheels to control the volume and the channel , the turbo button that also could be used to turn on the TV , the teletext button to faster switch the channel . Also , the group decided to give up on the solar cells and to use rechargeable batteries for the power source . Concerning the product cost , the group decided to use a regular chip for the speaker .
Marketing constructed a list of evaluation criteria based on the general user requirement . The group had an evaluation on the prototype , and they agreed it was a fancy , handy , and cool device that was easy to use . While User Interface disagreed with the criteria on whether people would change their remote control for a new one because he thought the banana did n't have a positive impression and it might have a market for young people .
When discussing the criteria on whether people would change their remote control , User Interface gave a two out of seven on it because of the negative impression the banana brought . In fact , User Interface did n't want a banana on the living room table though the product was handy , unless other twenty-five-Euro remote controls looked ugly . While , User Interface thought it still had the word of its feature at the beginning , so User Interface changed to give four on this criteria question .
The group had a production cost of 12.5 Euros . They agreed to not add solar cells for power source nor a sample speaker instead of a simple beep . They would have one battery , two regular chips on the print , double curves which stuck to the plastic , two scroll wheels , and three push buttons . The group would not use LCD and they would have a base station that was made out of units of plastic to balance the cost .
Project Manager agreed that the group had used fairly on the whiteboard and digital pen during the meeting . They all agreed on much creativity satisfaction during the discussion . User Interface supplemented that they should focus on broader target markets within the European countries . Also , Project Manager suggested that they should use the same evaluation criteria to do a street survey with young people . The group agreed to improve in an integrated circuit board to control things other than TV .
User Interface suggested two new ideas . Firstly , to simplify the circuit board that they were using inside . This was because the group might need an integrated circuit . Secondly , version two could have the ability to control things other than the TV and not just electronic equipment but the whole environment of the room .
The team discussed the conceptual design and some specific details in this meeting . Industrial Designer talked about the components concept of industrial design , such as the different choice of energy and the different material of the remote control . The team would find out which one to use in the future . User Interface designer gave the presentation about system design , mainly about programme design for different users and to help them use the device . Then the team decided to discuss the marketing part at first , then discuss what to design . Marketing talked about specific details found in the market survey . The team agreed to use fancier design , less buttons and focus on voice recognition . They would find out whether using LCD on remote controls was too expensive or not . Team members agreed to use a voice commander and fixed charger , which would prevent the remote control getting lost . Then the team talked about the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser .
The team talked about using a battery on the remote control and discussed different types of energy , they would find out if the kinetic metal was sufficient to provide enough energy . As to the shape of the remote control , there should be a curve which would fit into users ' hands when they grab the remote control . They discussed material used to design the case of remote control , such as plastic or titanium , but they were still discussing which one should be used .
The team could choose from the basic battery , kinetic battery and solar energy . Solar energy would not work in a cluttered environment . Kinetic battery was the one people could recharge by themselves . The team would find out if the kinetic metal was sufficient to provide enough energy .
Titanium case was trendy and modern . Users would be happy with it . But the team was still not very sure about the material of the case .
The team discussed a marketing survey about remote controls . They agreed to design remote controls with more fancy outlook and less buttons . The remote control should be easier to find and less complicated so users take less time to learn the functionality of it and the team discussed how to implement this function . They also talked about voice recognition and the scroller button . Then they agreed to design a child lock . Users could open child lock by pressing the button with some code . At last they discussed the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser . They decided to put numbers and words in the vocabulary . But they realized that it would be a challenge to make the speech recogniser distinguish between different voices and deal with noises and they would keep on discussing it .
The team decided that the remote control would beep if it got lost . Also , the remote control would be put on the fixed charger if users did not use it , so it would be hard to get lost .
Industrial Designer proposed that the team could have just numbers for channels and the speech recogniser should be able to distinguish between different voices and deal with noises .
Project Manager initiated the first meeting topic on the new project agenda , including welcoming the groupmates , the project plan , the project method and tools . Next , Project Manager invited everyone to draw their favourite animal on the whiteboard . Then , Project Manager introduced the target selling price of twenty-five Euros for the remote control and a profit of fifty million Euros . The target market would be the international market .
Project Manager introduced that the goal of this project was to develop a new remote control . It should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . The group would be going to follow the project method , which included three steps . First the functional design . The second 's a conceptual design , and then the detailed design . During each step of each design , groupmates need to work individually on their specific tasks and will meet to discuss and take decisions about what they did and what they will do next .
Firstly , User Interface drew a spider because he thought it was easy to draw in the corner of a whiteboard and spiders can move all about the web in two dimensions . Marketing drew a friendly panther because it was fast and black , so it could hide very easily . And it looked powerful and strong . Industrial Designer drew an elephant because it 's peculiar about the way they walk . And they are the biggest terrestrial animal .
Project Manager mentioned that they should target a selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control which would generate a profit of fifty million Euros . And they should target the international market . User Interface supplemented that they need to find out what people are willing to pay for and what kind of product they 're expecting for twenty-five Euro .
Marketing said when he was a child , he wanted to be a panther . Industrial Designer thought it would be difficult to draw a panther . Project Manager thought it would be very funny for them to see Marketing drawing a panther but Industrial Designer did n't like it . So Marketing said it was gon na be a friendly panther . User Interface supplemented that maybe it was happy because it just ate someone .
Industrial Designer gave a very detailed introduction to his drawing of an elephant , including the difference between Indian and African elephants . So Project Manager interrupted him and told group mates they would move on to the next topic because they had limited time for discussion . In addition , Project Manager said there would be an update meeting about elephants next time .
User Interface asked a question that whether it would be a stand-alone unit that they are going to be selling . So Project Manager answered that they should decide which kind of remote control they want to go , if it should be a specific remote control to some specific device , or if it should be a universal one . User Interface responded that they need to design the product to fit the expecting twenty-five Euro based on the requirement . Project Manager agreed and invited group mates to input ideas in the next meeting .
This meeting was about the functional design of the remote control . Firstly , User Interface presented on the technical function design . For the previous remote , User Interface found it was clunky but the functions were basic , or the remote was too complicated with lots of buttons . Based on this , User Interface demonstrated two kinds of buttons access to advanced functions . Next , Marketing presented on market trends and proposed three inspirations including the fancy look and technology innovation based on the customer needs . Then , Industrial Designer presented on the working design and introduced the working design logic of the battery and power source . Lastly , the group discussed the remote functions . They decided to have fifteen to thirty-five-year-old target groups as well as to have video controls map to advanced functionality so that they could skip the basic channel button .
Marketing mentioned three main inspirations . The first one was the customer ’ s need for the trend of fashion in electronics . The second one was the simplicity of technology and Marketing mentioned that existing customers would be willing to pay more for voice recognition . The third one was about the aesthetics , the look of the remote including its shape and colour .
Project Manager asked if people would think that installing a new remote was a technology innovation . Marketing was against it and recommended the voice recognition technology because Marketing found the recurring theme was fashionable and trendy .
The group mentioned that if they need to include speech recognition , they should target between fifteen and thirty-five because this age group would be willing to try new technology . Group mates also supplemented that this age group had a bit of expendable income to spend on the new technology and they were familiar with computers .
Industrial Designer introduced the basic working design logic of the remote , including the working process , the batteries , the power source to transmit the signal , the voice recognition as well as the interface for users to tab the button on the device .
The voice recognition could deliver advantages to physical disability and people not losing the remote . However , it could make people yell at the control for hours when the function was in trouble . So the group considered whether there was a need to add further advanced incorporation .
Industrial Designer mentioned that the power source would tell how long the device would last and how far it could transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions . Industrial Designer also mentioned that in the general design , the purpose of this was not to have a constraint in the sense of adding more power .
After Project Manager recapped the decisions made in the last meeting , such as having a child lock and display clock , User Interface started the presentation regarding how to make the interface more attractive to customers . Then , Industrial Designer gave the presentation on the component design of the remote , which was divided into two parts - the components in the remote and the working design . Afterwards , Marketing reported findings for marketing like the people wanting fewer buttons which the functions were obvious . In the end , Project Manager wrapped up the meeting , concluding what had to be done by each of them for the next meeting .
The general idea for the remote was that it should be easy to use , attractive and electricity saving . People might lose it a lot and it could be sold by using a slogan . For the technical aspect , the remote should have a chip with an interface that controls it , infrared bulbs , battery , wires , buttons and holder . There should be extra features such as timer , lid buttons , on-off button , channel lock and display clock . The remote could be in different shapes , preferably compact and T-shaped . The material should be of non-allergic nature . The different systems that exist were infrared and radio-waves .
There would be nine channel switches and a memory switch . There would be buttons for the next channel , subtitles , increasing and decreasing volume , mute and controlling features like colour , contrast , sharpness , brightness of picture . There also could be a speech recognition feature , which would be an integrated programmable sample sensor speaker unit that had voice recognizers to record the user 's voice and change functionalities accordingly . It was agreed that the interface should be simple with important features .
The interfaces shown on the slides were a remote that had voice recognizer with multi-purpose use such as for TV and cable-satellite , a simple and compact one that a child can use and could play with it and a big oversized remote that can not be misplaced . The team agreed that the T-shaped design and the children-friendly interface were nice but the over-big one was not ideal .
There should be a strong and recyclable case that was not made from harmful materials such as plastic . A resistor , capacitor , diode , transistor , circuit board and resonator should be in the remote , along with a timer and alarm facility . The integrated circuit could be highly sophisticated for higher efficiency and should be resistant to high and low temperatures . Also , colouring components could be used if the remote was to have different colours . For the battery , it could be rechargeable as people can use it for a long time and saves costs for production .
When a button was pressed , a small circuit underneath the button would send signals through the wires to the chip . The chip would know which button was pressed and produce a morse code signal specific to that button , which the transistor would amplify the signal . The LED would receive the signal and translate it into infrared light . The sensor on the TV would receive the infrared light which contained the signals and would react accordingly .
It was agreed that the circuit board would be printed in bulk as it would be cheaper with no wires and both regular and advanced chips could be made on print , including the infrared sender . A scroll wheel , presented as an alternative to push buttons , required a more sophisticated chip , making it more costly than push buttons , which require a regular chip . Hence , the team agreed to have push buttons to save cost . On the other hand , the case would be bright , colourful and strong with a trendy design . The battery was foreseen to be the energy source of the remote .
Materials could be made from plastic , rubber or wood and the remote could be in different cases . Speech recognition was pending for more research on how much it cost . In addition , there were doubts from Industrial Designer on this feature as there might be trouble in recognizing different voices .
People liked something that fit their hand and fewer buttons which the functions were obvious . They did n't want to squint at small prints and did n't care for different modes . The appearance of the remote should be eye-catching and appealing . The remote had to be in the market before competition for Christmas . Fruit and vegetable shapes were very popular this year and people were back into a soft and spongy feel with a little cloth . The star features of the remote should be narrowed down to one or two and voice recognizer could be an option .
Industrial Designer was supposed to have the look and feel of the design , User Interface should have come up with user interface design and Marketing should have the product evaluation for the next meeting . Furthermore , User Interface and Marketing had to work together on a prototype using modelling clay and everyone would receive specific instructions sent by coaches .
This was the functional design meeting , where the team discussed what functions should be included in the remote and how they should be carried out . User Interface gave a presentation on the design of the remote , offering a complex version and a simple one . Marketing followed with a presentation on the functional requirements of the remote , pointing out that the remote should be both high-tech looking and user-friendly , preferably with fewer buttons , a lost-and-found function and speech recognition . Industrial Designer then presented the working design for the remote , including its power source , chips and the component layout . The team then went into a further in-depth discussion , dealing with the specific points raised in the above presentations . After everyone had shared their ideas , Project Manager closed the meeting by distributing new tasks among the team members for them to work on until their next meeting .
Marketing first shared the results of their lab tests . It was found that users preferred a fancier but yet simpler remote , and as a result , their product should be high-tech looking but also user-friendly . Since the research found that most users would only use ten percent of the buttons , they decided to only keep the most necessary ones on their remote . Users also claimed that remotes tend to be lost easily . Finally , since speech recognition was popular among users , the remote should have this function as well .
According to the lab tests , users only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote . It was shown that users did n't really need all the buttons provided by current remotes , and it would be more user-friendly if their new remote could lose the unnecessary ones . The most frequently used buttons were those for the channel , the volume and the power on/off .
One thing they could do was to design a lost-and-found function to accommodate the user 's need to retrieve the remote when it was lost . Another way was to give it a modern eye-catching design that could distinguish the new remote from current standard ones . Also , given that speech recognition was an up-and-coming thing among their target group , they could include this function in the remote , allowing users to control their devices by simply speaking to it .
Project Manager first announced that their product was only going to be a TV remote instead of a multifunctional one , and that the yellow colour and the slogan of their company should be included in their design . Their target group should be people of all ages with little to no technical literacy . The specific functions of their remote should include sending messages to the TV , lost-and-found assistance , and speech recognition . A menu button could be designed to cover all various additional functions .
Industrial Designer suggested that the remote could be attached to a charger base , and the lost remote would beep if a button on the base was pushed . This might add to their costs , and would require a rechargeable battery for the remote . Project Manager later proposed that the speech recognition could be part of the lost-and-found device . This would allow the remote to beep when hearing a certain phrase .
User Interface first asked whether they could possibly leave out the number buttons , but this proposal was turned down by others . They simplified the buttons to on-off , volume , mute , channel up/down , and the numbers 0–9 . For more advanced functions , Project Manager suggested an additional one-for-all menu button that would allow the user to pull up various options on the TV screen . The channel and volume buttons could be used for navigating the menu page .
This is the second meeting of the design group . Project Manager went through the notes of the last meeting and informed the team of the management 's requirements . They expected the remote control to cover television only and asked the team to incorporate the company logo and colours . As the team is looking at extreme simplicity , the buttons should be reduced to the absolute minimum . Voice recognition can also be added to reach this point . In addition , the remote control can be powered by a rechargeable or permanent battery .
Marketing summarized the market research results and revealed that fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons . So the team proposed to reduce buttons to a minimum . Marketing believed that speech recognition could also contribute to this regard . User Interface showed a user-centred remote control and an engineering-centred one and preferred the user-centred one as it had fewer buttons and was easier to hold .
Marketing proposed to apply speech recognition and suggested that some of the buttons could be hidden from everyday use . Project Manager agreed and proposed to get the remote control with no buttons but later rejected the idea and supposed that dual functions could be used .
Age group data for remote control use was not available ; many people may not want to learn to use the new remote control ; some buttons are still needed , such as channel control , volume settings and on/off .
Project Manager expected to have a remote control permanently available . Industrial Designer proposed to have a rechargeable battery or a battery dock , while Project Manager preferred a disposable one . Then Industrial Designer came up with a combination of both solar and conventional batteries .
Project Manager preferred to have disposable remote control of which battery life was predetermined and proposed to move parts more by not even having a battery compartment . The usage of permanent batteries was also proposed .
Industrial Designer initially proposed to have rechargeable energy sources and then suggested a combination of both solar and conventional batteries . It means that if there 's enough light , then it 's using the light , but when it is dark , then the battery is used .
The meeting discussed various topics such as data collection and updates on the German parser . They discussed XML modifications and future thoughts on the ontology . Additionally , object representations will include an EVA vector . This can be incorporated in the database entry for a particular building or inherited from the ontology of the building type . The actual number of the inputs can create a combinatorial explosion when setting the probabilities . In any case , further to fulfilling the basic requirements ( translating the parser and the generator into english ) , the project is entirely open-ended in terms of focus of research .
The actual number of the inputs in the Bayes-net can create a combinatorial explosion when setting the probabilities . Noisy-OR 's can help avoid this by simplifying the probability tables and applying a deterministic function to produce their complete version .
Object representations will include an EVA vector . This can be incorporated in the database entry for a particular building or inherited from the ontology of the building type . As the project evolves , further enrichment of the ontology ( actions , linguistic features ) will be necessary .
As the data collection is about to begin , there are some minor changes to be done in the design of the experiment , the script and the permission forms . Subjects can be recruited either from within the university or through other social circles .
The team wanted the data participants to minimize their contact with their data . They wanted them to sign a waiver first not to view the transcript by default only allowing them to view it .
The meeting with the Welsh Government is mainly about the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on education in Wales . To start with , Kirsty Williams AM indicated that still there was not an exact date schools might reopen . Students could only return to school in the safe environment , which required the lead from scientific and medical advisers . Meanwhile , Kirsty Williams AM emphasized that the government would not relax any of the restrictions with regard to education and new measuring methods would be applied concerning performance rate , etc . It was suggested that there was an increase in the number of attendances to the open hubs and the ability to test , to trace and to quarantine would be critical to the next phase . Moreover , the meeting agreed that schools should remain in contact with children in need and continue to identify vulnerable children with emotional and mental health difficulties . Also , methods to assure sustainable higher education would be applied and vocational qualification students would fear none . Last but not least , although the education cost for students receiving support regime would decrease , there would be no change on the allowance .
Hefin David AM raised a question concerning the date schools might reopen since there had been an increase in the number of students who had returned to some schools . However , Kirsty Williams AM had not been given an exact date by the chief medical officer and the public had to wait for the advice of the medical and scientific advisers . Now , the only thing for certain was the five principles that had been published earlier that day concerning the school reopening issues .
Firstly , any decision to have more children returning to school made should align with the safety and the physical and the emotional well-being of students and the staff . Secondly , new decisions made from the education ministry should be taken in the context of the wider Welsh Government response to dealing with this pandemic . Thirdly , communication with the parents and staff were crucial and they should be given time to adapt to the changes . Moreover , certain groups of children accessing more education within a school setting should also be considered . Lastly , to have adequate numbers of workforce available in order to assure those settings as safe as possible , and how to tackle with the challenges about keeping social distancing in the context of education or school transport issues should be taken into account .
Sian Gwenllian AM introduced that according to the Welsh Government , currently 1 percent of the children of Wales and some 5 percent of the staff actually attended the schools . Kirsty Williams AM added that on average , there were 518 school hubs open each day , with up to 4,200 children attending . There has been an increase in the number of attendances since the summer term and there were approximately 5.6 per cent of the teaching population working in those hubs . The overall education situation seemed positive , with 600 vulnerable children averaging per day .
To answer Sian Gwenllian AM 's question , Kirsty Williams AM mentioned that to include more critical workers and vulnerable students , more local authorities had been advised to move to a hub model , and the education ministry office had been able to publish guidance to local authorities on how issues around safe working in those hubs should be followed . Local authorities are asked to report any incidents where they were concerned about operation issues on the ground . Kirsty Williams AM also agreed with Sian Gwenllian AM that testing was crucially important in dealing with this crisis and the ability to be able to test , to trace and to quarantine would be critical to the next phase .
Dawn Bowden AM asked about the methods to include more vulnerable children to the hubs and to begin with , Kirsty Williams AM suggested that this challenge was faced by the four nations . The Welsh Government , together with local authorities and local education systems were looking to support families whose children had special education needs in a number of ways , including to decrease risks for hiring a social worker . Moreover , Dawn Bowden AM assumed that appropriate referral mechanisms should still be in place , which was agreed by Kirsty Williams AM who added that schools should remain in contact with children and continue to identify vulnerable children .
Kirsty Williams AM mentioned that those children would have currently been receiving school counselling , and there would be more children receiving support . In this case , the additional money will be made available to local authorities to be able to increase and ramp up services to support children and families with intense need . Moreover , how to adapt patterns to deliver these services to the pandemic situation would be discussed . For instance , video or telephone methods would be adopted and one to one basis help patterns would also be included to support professional learning for counsellings .
As being questioned by Suzy Davies AM about continuing studies at home during the lockdown , Kirsty Williams AM suggested that educationalists and social services staff had really reached out to families and they intent to make sure that families with difficulties were aware of the support that was available out there for them and their children . Meanwhile , local authorities were encouraged to keep in contact with families to recognize their special needs for student education at home .
Kirsty Williams AM first introduced the difficult situation as being face by these group of children , whose educational journey would be slightly different with others . And it was always important that children could have an equal opportunity and have equal access to learning at this time . To tackle the challenge , Hwb digital learning platform had been heavily invested and the government had also invested heavily in the national purchasing of Microsoft Office and Google for Education tools , which were available to all families . Meanwhile , connection to the Internet would further be assured .
Kirsty Williams AM shared that the government were working closely with local authorities to understand what school had already done , for instance lending Chromebooks , iPads and laptops to children . Schools should make sure that students ' access to current education patterns were available to all . Besides , nationwide purchase of digital learning tools , the government was also looking to purchase and distribute Mi-Fi connectivity on a national level . Last but not least , the government and local authorities were together continuing to identify education gap and decided to repurpose some of the resources which had been previously identified for the EdTech investment , using those resources to fill this particular gap .
Janet Finch-Saunders AM asked about how A-level and GCSE would be awarded in alignment with Qualifications Wales and Kirsty Williams AM explained that to cancel this summer 's exam series was the only clear decision although it was devastating for both students and teachers . Currently , to grade the performance , teachers would first be asked to submit a grade they believed that the student would have obtained , should they have taken an exam . And teachers would have a range of data and their own professional judgment when grading . Once that information had been submitted to Qualifications Wales , there would be a process by which that data would be moderated ; moderated from centre to centre and across the nation .
To get the students who planned to enter college for the next step , Kirsty Williams AM introduced that last week , on Hwb , they were able to launch a programme for year 13 students to help them get ready for university . On the Hwb website , students would be able to see the subject listings , everything from animal science through to law , politics , history and science , with links through to higher education and further education courses that students could avail themselves of . There was also a section on preparation for essential study skills , whether that was report writing or academic writing.Similar preparation like the help from career advice website was also accessible . Meanwhile , new materials and resources would be developed .
Suzy Davies AM asked whether the money of the student support regime would decrease since students were currently studying at home at a much lower cost . Kirsty Williams AM made it clear that there would be no change on that , as the same amount of money would go to students ' accounts as a way of assuring students ' attendance and the family 's confidence under the extreme situation .
The group discussed the collection status for a set of connected digits recordings that are nearly complete and ready to be trained on a recognizer . Anticipated results were discussed in reference to results obtained for other digits corpora , i.e . Aurora and TI-digits . The group also considered the prospect of performing fine-grained acoustic-phonetic analyses on a subset of Meeting Recorder digits or Switchboard data . Pre-segmentation manipulations that allow for the segmentation of channel-specific speech/non-speech portions of the signal and the distinction of foreground versus background speech were discussed . Finally , speaker fe008 and fe016 reported on new efforts to adapt transcriptions to the needs of the SRI recognizer , including conventions for encoding acronyms , numbers , ambient noise , and unidentified inbreaths .
The group discussed the collection status for a set of connected digits recordings that are nearly complete and ready to be trained on a recognizer . Anticipated results were discussed in reference to results obtained for other digits corpora , i.e . Aurora and TI-digits .
decision was also made to delegate transcribers with the task of labelling a subset of digits or Switchboard data for fine-grained acoustic-phonetic features . Speaker fe008 will run selected Meeting Recorder data through channelize and determine whether the resulting units are of a sufficient length .

Pre-segmentation manipulations that allow for the segmentation of channel-specific speech/non-speech portions of the signal and the distinction of foreground versus background speech were discussed .
The group discussed the prospect of performing fine-grained acoustic-phonetic analyses on a subset of digits or Switchboard data . It was suggested that prior to the use of data-driven methods , knowledge-driven approaches should be used to 'seed ' the data with sub-phonemic features , either manually , or using a rich pronunciation dictionary . A new version of the pre-segmentation tool that segments channel-specific speech/non-speech portions of the signal has been developed and tested .
The whole meeting was focused on the functional design of the new remote control project . First of all , Marketing , User Interface , and Industrial Designer each gave a presentation about user requirements , technical function design , and working design respectively . Then , Project Manager announced some amendments to project requirements , which automatically rejected some of the previous assumptions and aroused further discussion about design and functionality with people above 40 as target customers .
Project Manager announced that the remote control ought to be only suitable for TV , and that teletext as an outmoded function should be skipped , while internet access becomes an optional function . Meanwhile , target customers are specified as 40 plus . However , Project Manager 's requirements of no teletext and design simplification were effectively challenged and rebutted by Marketing . As a result , the focus on the project was changed from design to functionality .
Marketing was strongly against the `` no teletext but internet '' requirement , because he thought there was little chance that customers over 40 would use TVs with internet access in the near future . And he added that teletext was no doubt a key feature for the remote control , especially for the elder generation , and hence should not be ruled out anyway . Consequently , the group agreed to keep teletext and further negotiate with the board .
Marketing considered fancy design to be insignificant , as he believed that unlike the younger generation , people of 40 plus were not that particular about appearance and would care more about its functionality instead . Marketing 's opinion was subsequently agreed by other team members .
Firstly , after a short debate , the group reached a consensus that basic layout would be enough for the button design , on which too much emphasis would be unnecessary for the elder generation . Then , the group agreed to implement a docking station as an extra with a positioning function . Also , as opposed to touchscreen or LCD screen , an ordinary small screen and default materials were applauded . Finally , Project Manager proposed to specify the target group as people above 60 , which could improve product image as Marketing said .
Though Project Manager brought up scroll button and joystick as possible options , Industrial rejected that idea by arguing that the elderly were not accustomed to using them , therefore basic layout would be sufficient . Then Marketing further pointed out that there was not so much to gain in the competition of less buttons , as very few buttons would be needed for a TV remote anyway . Project Manager accepted those ideas .
Marketing 's research about user requirements showed that 50 % of the people tended to find their remote controls lost . Therefore , the docking station as an extra would help users find its position . To achieve this the audio sign would be implemented . When users pressed a button , the phone on the remote control went ringing and indicated its position .
The meeting consisted of participants giving an update on their projects . The team learned that the Eurospeech paper was accepted . PhD C told the team about strange activity in on-line normalization with regards to C-zero and C-one . Grad A shared his work on quals and intention to start cheating experiments . Grad G informed the team that phase normalization was coming along after a bug was fixed , but the results were still not great . Finally , the team discussed Weiner filtering for the Aurora task and the mathematical formulation of the VTS .
PhD C informed the team that the Eurospeech paper had been accepted and the conference would take place in Aalborg Denmark in September . The team was making progress on on-line normalization , taking two approaches .
PhD C told the team about two approaches to on-line normalization . On was using a time constant and the other was using different means for silence and speech . But the means were not behaving as expected . Addition of white noise made it such that the important difference between the means disappeared .
The professor suggested delving deep into the different types of errors in the difference between silence and speech means . He thought that training and testing in the same kind of white noise would be an effective strategy . In his opinion , the differences were hurting the recognition , even though they were not too big .
Grad A was working on cheating experiments to study classification of phones for his qualifying exam . Grad G fixed a bug in his Matlab code for phase normalization and started receiving better results .
The professor thought that the Broadcast News net could be scaled down . The big one took two to three weeks . Phase normalization experiments relied on it . He also suggested that the math can be simplified to just complex numbers .
Grad A thought that the experiments would explain which categories were good for speech recognition . The experiments would do phone recognition with TIMIT and the output would go into a standard recognizer , maybe Chronos .
This was meeting number 22 of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVD-19 Pandemic . Firstly , members were given the chance to present their petitions . Secondly , the meeting proceeded to statements by some members . The third part , the major section , was the questioning of ministers . These questions were closely related to the Canadian government and society during the pandemic period . To be more specific , they included economic updates , systemic racism , the impact of international affairs , financial issues , the situation of veterans and the disabled , and employment and work situation nationwide .
The discussion about the questions of minister started with the issue of economic update , and then it turned to discuss the federal support for the provinces . The following topics were systemic racism . Hon . Chrystia Freeland emphasized that systemic racism had existed in all federal institutions in Canada .
Christine Normandin mentioned that in the past it took a long time for the provinces to negotiate conditions with the federal government . Christine Normandin wanted to know the future situation : whether the federal government would send the money unconditionally .
Hon . Chrystia Freeland stated that there had existed racism in Canada . Systemic racism had existed in all federal institutions , including the RCMP .
This part mainly discussed a number of financial questions happening during the pandemic . Those involved the foreign businessmen , veterans , and rural communities , project to widen the road . There followed a series of detailed questions and answers about veterans ' compensation and pension .
Hon . Bill Blair , Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness , stated that the priority must be the protection of the health and safety of Canadians , and restrictions for non-essential travel , and a 14-day quarantine was required for those who had an essential purpose .
Hon . Lawrence MacAulay assured that everyone was welcome to enter the discussion to provide as appropriate compensation as possible . On the other side , it represented democracy .
Dane Lloyd asked about the budget given by the government in the economic recession , This was to table an economic update and provide jobs . As for the disabilities , Louise Chabot pointed to the bill regarding the disabilities and why it was not passed .
The government let people who lived with substance use to access medications more easily . Safe injection sites had been made in communities and community-based projects had been supported for people who were using substances .
Hon . Ahmed Hussen mentioned that the government had announced a one-time of $ 600 for persons with disabilities to address the expense in need . However , this bill was refused by the Conservatives yet it was expected to be passed in one day .
This section firstly pointed at the employment issues faced during the pandemic . Next , the topic turned to the emergency wage subsidy that was supporting over a 2.5million workers . The meeting grouped workers in different sectors and discussed them step by step . The listed groups included the students , foreign workers , health care workers , forestry workers , and workers in the oil and gas sector .
Hon . Ahmed Hussen appreciated the work of the summer jobs program which can provide both financial resources and necessary experience for young people . Thus the investment of the Canada summer jobs problem would be continued .
A made-in-Canada initiative had engaged companies across Canada and they had retooled and scaled up their operations for personal protective equipment . This assisted front-line health care workers .
Project Manager introduced a new remote control project for television . At first , team members got their roles . Then they discussed what had to be done to design a remote control which had different features . Priority will be given to the functions . For example , team members hoped that users could choose what they want not by channels but by contents . To implement the functions , they discussed a lot , such as speech recognition interface and navigation buttons .
User Interface thought there should be a function , instead of choosing the TV channel , users could choose TV channels or the contents of the programme . It was more powerful . Some of the websites already provide this service so this technology is also available .
User Interface thought that with a speech recognition interface , users were choosing the programmes directly instead of pressing the channel number . It was not costly and it was different technology and more powerful .
Marketing said that the team should be careful about the size of the remote control . He proposed that TV itself could have a remote control system which could be user friendly . He was suggesting some different technology .
User Interface proposed that there should be six or seven buttons for the same number of categories . Users could use these buttons to choose hundreds of channels . These buttons could be navigation buttons .
The team would talk about how to gather information about the contents , set the remote control system browse by channel or browse by contents and to reflect about it .
The team members introduced themselves and their positions respectively . Project Manager announced the plan for the three-phase remote control project . The team members drew their favourite animals to get more familiar with each other . Project Manager informed the team of their financial target , which was 50 million Euros . Each 25-Euro remote control would make a profit of 12.5 Euros . The team members had many ideas on the remote control design . User Interface recommended an integrating remote control for several different devices , as well as an ergonomic curve design . Marketing spotted a niche in the game market and thus suggested adopting a bar-code design . Industrial Designer added that the team could consider incorporating a keypad for the better game experience .
Project Manager informed the team of their financial target , which was 50 million Euros . Each 25-Euro remote control would make a profit of 12.5 Euros . The team members had many ideas on the remote control design . User Interface recommended an integrating remote control for several different devices . Marketing spotted a niche in the game market and thus suggested adopting a bar-code design .
User Interface initially believed that there would be an emerging market for the touch screen remote control which could be programmed in a sophisticated way . Users could redesign their remote controls to their own needs . Remote controls originally designed for different devices could now be integrated . Project Manager , however , reminded User Interface about the budget issue . User Interface then admitted that a conventional push button would be a better choice than a touch screen .
Marketing noticed that gaming on TV was getting popular and hoped that the new remote control could become a specialized keypad for game players . Marketing desired buttons that would not get worn out too easily for the new remote control . A bar-code design was desirable as well .
When discussing the basic functionality , the team agreed that it was the most important to meet the user requirements . Industrial Designer suggested that the team could consider incorporating a keypad for the better game experience . User Interface went on making a contribution . An ergonomic curve design was recommended by User Interface and appreciated by Project Manager , for it would make the remote control look more stylish .
Marketing desired to design self-intuitive buttons for game players . Industrial Designer expressed a preference for a game control keypad rather than big separate buttons . Project Manager accepted the latter suggestion , for keypads on consoles were common and user-friendly nowadays , so it would also be feasible to incorporate one on the remote control . Besides , Project Manager pointed out that a keypad would allow easier navigation and be used as a joystick .
According to ergonomics , the remote control was expected to fit as comfortable as possible into the hand . In addition , User Interface hoped that the remote control could have an unconventional and attractive shape . A small and stylish curve was User Interface 's final choice to make the remote control look more unique .
The meeting was mainly about the provision of textbooks and learning resources for pupils . To start with , Philip Blaker generally introduced the position of Qualification Wales in the education system , focusing on the design of the qualifications and then the delivery of the assessment . Meanwhile , Gareth Pierce talked about the process of making teaching materials available bilingually , both in English and Welsh language . It was suggested that both versions be carried out simultaneously to ensure equity . Concerns were also raised about whether the procedure would delay the availability of the textbooks . What 's more , the meeting also discussed the digitalization of materials . The council worried that the lack of digital accessibility and digital literacy would have an impact on pupils ' performance . However , it was concluded that the process would widen the access to different materials . The meeting also talked about the timetable of the curriculum reform and the general plan for the future , mainly on the qualification and teaching materials .
Qualification Wales was the regulator of the awarding bodies , mainly focusing on the design of the qualifications and the delivery of the assessment . They were also responsible for maintaining standards , making sure that the grades people got were fair through comparable outcomes .
Gareth Pierce was aware that many websites they referred to in their resources and many case studies were purely in English , while it was the Welsh language that was used in the educational context . Gareth Pierce believed it was very unfortunate for different schools to translate materials independently from each other , concluding that it would be necessary to translate materials in both languages to enable teachers to refer to terms in both languages .
Darren Millar thought replacing textbooks would cause a lot of pressure and extra work for teachers and students , believing that the textbook was a basic element for children to learn and revise and an essential core piece for qualification . Also the digital resources were not accessible for everyone even in Wales . Darren Millar AN was also worried some learners would face disadvantages as a result of textbooks , who might not adapt digital contents well .
About the accessibility of digital resources , Mike Ebbsworth held that the teachers could print the materials to suit the learners at any given time , while Gareth Pierce believed that the technology , as well as the content of a textbook in some form , was vital . They both agreed that the digitalization process would add flexibility to the teaching materials . About the pupils ' adaptation of digital contents , the WJEC thought digital literacy was a basic skill for examinations as A-level or GSCE . Also it was hard to evaluate whether it was the lack of textbooks that affected pupils ' performance , as there were so many factors .
Gareth Pierce believed that the subsidy would be necessary , and thought of the subsidy for producing resources in two languages for the curriculum .
The publishers in England agreed to hold the English version back for a period of time until the Welsh version was available and then to publish simultaneously .
Darren Millar AM thought it was inappropriate to delay the availability of a textbook that was already late on schedule so that the two language version could be published on the same day . John Griffiths worried that the approach would potentially put English students using the English-language version or Welsh students using the Welsh-language version at a disadvantage .
Gareth pierce believed that there were different types of unfairness in different individuals ' opinions . It was hard to judge what sort of inequality could be having an impact on young people in therms of achievement . So Gareth Pierce did n't think he could go any further than acknowledging any inequality was unfair .
They drew on a body of expertise and emphasized the importance of the approach and skill . They would also assist young people with their engagement with the scholar items and understanding some themes .
Gareth Pierce decided that they would have regular meetings with Estyn about any problems with the specimen assessments and the mark schemes . They agreed with Estyn that ideally the whole package of resources should be available before teaching starts and would work on that .
Philip Blaker thought it needed to be determined . But he also believed that Welsh Government had a role in curriculum at that moment , so Welsh Government had responsibility for the curriculum and drew people together to look at the new model for the future .
The meeting started off with petitions from members that included appeals to the Government to take action on issues such as raising the minimum wage for essential workers . The members then moved on to giving statements that included recognition for people who had recently lost their lives , as well as praise and criticism for efforts by the Government and private organizations . Finally , the members quizzed ministers on various issues facing various groups such as farmers and women .
Condolences were shared to the families of the people who were involved in a fatal accident in Placentia bay . Sadly , Mr. Dufuor , Mr. Rogers , and Mrs. Louise Feltham also passed away the week before . Condolences were also given to the essential workers who lost their lives in service of others .
The Liberals were accused of promoting the harmful status quo of maintaining the ban on blood donations from gay men and trans women . Additionally , they , together with the conservatives , were also accused of using the emergency wage subsidy to fund their own partisan activities at the expense of vulnerable citizens .
Essential workers were thanked for their efforts in saving lives during the ongoing pandemic . It was noted that the week was Paramedic Services Week in appreciation of their work .
Farmers were faced by inaccessibility of financial aid due to the complicated online calculator . Even after consulting with accountants , it still was n't clear on how to navigate the assistance program .
Funds were requested to help fight human trafficking that affected vulnerable women and girls . There was concern for the rise in women abuse going up by as much as 400 % and funds to support organizations to fight this not being released . Additionally , the members were made aware of the stripping of titles from First Nation women .
Ms. Leah Gazan asked for help to tackle homelessness and provide rental assistance . The Minister of Families , Children and Social Development pointed to the ministries efforts to help with essential supplies and expenses .
After a brief review of the last meeting , Industrial Designer , User Interface and Marketing gave their presentations respectively on components , interface design and user requirements of the new remote control . Considering Marketing 's advice and the budget , the team temporarily decided on a double-curved rubber remote control with an ergonomic joystick and an LCD screen menu display . Users could program their remote controls on the LCD screen as well as using software on the computer . Power would be supplied to the remote control by standard batteries . The beeping sound of the location function could be customized . Project Manager informed the team of the plan for the next meeting . Industrial Designer and User Interface would present a prototype of the remote control . The team would also make a product evaluation .
Marketing pointed out that customers generally expected the new remote control to be fancy and technologically innovative . The trendiest shape might be fruit and vegetable . Users hoped that the remote control could be spongy . Marketing suggested that the team could decide on a shape of fruit and rubber material .
During Industrial Designer 's presentation , the team was asked to choose from rubber , plastic and titanium . Marketing showed a preference for rubber . The reasons were explained when user requirements of the new remote control were presented . Marketing pointed out that customers expected the remote control to be spongy . To bring a spongy feel , rubber was the best choice . Besides , rubber was damage-resistant , and its price was more reasonable than titanium .
The team made some decisions on the remote control design for the present stage . The keypad was given up , for a menu display could better classify channels into subgroups . Standard components such as the conventional battery were the final choices for the remote control . The team would adopt a double-curved design and rubber material . A corporate logo would be incorporated . There would be a special beeping sound for the location function . The new remote control could be programmed on the LCD screen as well as using software on the computer . In the next meeting , Industrial Designer and User Interface would present a prototype of the remote control . The team would also make a product evaluation .
User Interface pointed out that the keypad might irritate users , for it was hard for them to remember the exact number of every channel . Instead , User Interface recommended the LCD screen menu display . With the menu structure , channels could be better classified into subgroups . Users could name these subgroups as `` news '' , `` music '' and so on .
Marketing did not understand the purpose of a programmable remote control . Project Manager agreed with User Interface on that if users used the remote control for different devices , they would need to program particular commands into codes on the remote control . Project Manager added that users could even make the remote control perform a specific function by looking up the function name produced by themselves , instead of looking for the command code on the computer .
Project Manager mentioned the target market group because the team would make a product evaluation on the next meeting . Project Manager implied that the team should consider a younger age bracket , for they were most likely to be the group that owned enough free cash , and was , at the same time , prone to replace their remote controls .
The group discussed recording equipment and setup issues , recent developments in the transcription effort , other potential types of tagging to be assigned to transcribers , and the post-processing of waveforms . The discussion was largely focused on efforts to facilitate transcriptions , including the improvement of strategies for transcribing overlapping speech , and achieving greater uniformity in the type of equipment used during recordings and the manner in which recording devices are worn by speakers .
Use of dissimilar microphones adds an extra , unwanted variable to individual speaker recordings . Similarly , differences in the type of recording equipment used and the manner in which microphones are worn by speakers causes problems for the transcription effort .
Setting up a microphone array and performing video recordings ( in a possible collaboration with NIST ) are problematic due to the types of changes in infrastructure they require .
To achieve greater uniformity in across-speaker recording conditions , the group decided to purchase three additional head-mounted microphones .
IBM has a team of people employed to transcribe meeting data , and who are transcribing single versus multiple channels .
The group discussed the potential for assigning additional tasks to ICSI 's transcriber pool , including tagging more fine-grained acoustic information , and discourse and disfluency tagging .
The transcriber pool has been performing within the expected range of work completed per the amount of time spent transcribing .
The meeting was mostly about the logistics of covering the legal bases around releasing meeting data . The team wanted to make sure that meeting participants would not sue for libel or releasing unwanted information . The team also went over the transcriptions that IBM had done as well as storage space , which was finally looking up . The meeting ended with a general discussion about the progress of the group and future directions .
The team decided to release their data on July 15th , but they still wanted to give people time to bleep things from the transcripts . There was skepticism that they could actually reach out to people and get everyone 's consent that they were okay with whatever was being released .
The team thought that people would not respond to their emails , which would be compounded by them being out of town over the summer . Based on knowledge about similar data collection , they thought that emails should be enough , but skepticism about getting consent with emails prevailed .
Grad F was responsible for bringing up the topic . Apparently , no one had replied to the emails allowing people to bleep things out so far . According to Grad F , as long as the email was sent out , the team was covered . Grad F thought this had been settled when the project started and did not need to be revisited .
The team decided that it would be a good idea to purchase headphones . They also ordered a hundred gigabytes of disk space though they thought an extra eighteen for backup would not be a bad idea . This was good because the team was currently constrained by space .
Postdoc A thought that the original headphones had low gain , so he purchased new earphones . He informed the team that he just bought them from Cambridge SoundWorks down the street . They always have them in stock .
The professor thought that anyone who needed headphones should purchase them since they were not very expensive . He wanted to get the discussion about disk space out of the way . He informed the team that he had ordered a hundred gigabytes .
This meeting was a conceptual design meeting . In this meeting , the group mainly discussed the component , energy source , buttons , colours and styles of the remote control . They decided to use the kinetic as the energy source because of its convenience , light weight , fancy design and the good selling point of the environment , but they still needed more cost research . They also reached a final consensus to apply a hard plastic inner shell with a spongy plastic for the component , and push buttons for the type of interface due to their common features of convenience and user-friendliness .
User Interface suggested a simple plastic remote control in yellow and black with few big buttons which could correspond to a screen on the television screen . But this idea of having a screen on the television screen was faced by Industrial Designer 's objection . Industrial Designer preferred scroll buttons , and a simple but functional menu on the screen , and simple push buttons . In the end , they chose a push button for better feasibility .
User Interface thought it was rather meaningless to put the screen on the television screen . It would be better if they only made a menu with different options through which users can change the settings and find information about programs .
User Interface suggested a simple interface with a few scroll wheels on it , but User Interface also appreciated the idea of chunky plastic remote control with big buttons , which was simple , easy to use and cost effective .
The group rejected the idea of wind-up because it was n't suitable for the theme of the remote control , and the idea of solar power because it was inconvenient to use in darkness . Industrial Designer suggested using the kinetic as the source of power . This opinion was accepted by the group because of its convenience , light weight , fancy design and the good selling point of the environment .
The kinetic was both useful and convenient . Users only had to move it instead of putting it into a recharger or changing the batteries , and it could also be used easily in dark places . More importantly , it could be a good selling point that doing exercises when users were watching the TV helps the remote control work .
Industrial Designer argued that compared with the traditional energy source - double A batteries in a replaceable little compartment , wind-up was a quite interesting concept for the remote control . But this concept did n't get along well with the possible banana theme of the remote control . Therefore , the kinetic energy source would be a better choice .
The project was finally coming to a conclusion and the team was getting ready to share their results . They achieved an error rate reduction for the task , but the error rate in itself was still significant . The team also had to think about how they could make their model efficient for it to be deployed as they continue with future research . They discussed some new directions and were reminded that while the initial phase was over , much work lied ahead of them .
The deployed model generally decreased error rates , but the extent to which it did so varied based on the language as well as where it was deployed . They learned that similar projects experienced the same challenges . Still , the model was not efficient and likely used too much CPU and memory for the benefit it provided .
The worst systems were still reducing errors between a third to half of the time . Though , there was a system in Aurora that did not do very well and the Alcatel systems seemed to do better .
The professor explained that while the Danish model did not improve overall , the results were mixed over six cases . The team 's models led to improvements , even without bug fixes , but they were better on the Danish than German .
The team gathered some ideas on how they could further improve the model , perhaps by focusing more so on MSG and multi-band . The professor iterated that the task was pretty hard , and their model was still not good enough for a real system . The team was generally excited about the Aurora data , as it was more realistic , and about further pursuing the task .
The professor thought that they needed to work more and asked who had ideas on how they could pursue new directions . He himself wanted to try out playing with MSG and multi-band . He also thought that they should try learning more about different acoustic environments .
PhD C and the professor expressed a desire to learn more about nets that incorporated multiple languages . They thought they could explore whether it was better to have one net for many languages or different nets for each language .
The team discussed SRI experiments , multi-band approaches , latency , VAD , and noise addition . The mean subtraction approach for SRI that relied on a twelve second interval resulted in a zero point three percent improvement over the six second model , not necessarily significant . The team thought that training the model on different speeds of speech would be helpful to add to this progress . Grad A introduced the team to her formal proposal for the qualifier exam . The work focused on intermediate classifiers and multi-band graphical models for speech recognition . The team then discussed noise removal as well The model PhD B was working on did not do well in non-stationary noise environments . In general , however , the model had improved . The VAD was labeling speech as silence segments , which could be attributed to alignment issues . The team thought that noise addition techniques might help the model .
The SRI system was doing worse on the hub-five training set for mean subtraction . The model performed better on six seconds of training data rather than twelve seconds , but the improvement was only point three percent . The professor thought small differences were important for research but not as important in industry . One suggestion for further work was changing speech rate using the algorithm , though it came at the risk of degrading the data .
The professor thought it mattered how fast someone was speaking since the model was getting a spectrum over different kinds of speech sounds . He was skeptical that changing speech rate was the solution , though he thought it was worth looking into . His solution was collecting more samplings of different phones for when people speak slower .
Grad C thought that one way to improve performance might be training LDA filters in different conditions . The professor D agreed that the LDA filter was interesting . He thought hamming would work too . Professor G said that most people just do on-line filtering , which entailed subtracting the mean , not LDA .
Too much noise was causing the model to perform worse , so the noise addition was constant and not too high . The overall improvement was good . The smoothing for the average for noise addition was only done on low gains . The model performed better on high mismatch .
The model that PhD B was working on performed better on high mismatch than on the well matched case . The professor thought that this reflected the team 's priority , which had always focused more so on the high mismatched case . PhD H was concerned that their model did worse on medium and high mismatch . Adding noise hurt their model .
Professor G was trying to understand where the smoothing took place in PhD B 's model . Professor G suggested that the smoothing was best done as early as possible .
The meeting focused on the results from the existing model , speeding up the backend for feature direction , and a few tangential topics being developed for future exploration . The team was unsure why their model was not performing as well as they expected it to , and they suspected that their smaller dataset might be at fault . They also discussed how they could improve the performance of the backend model by improving feature detection . The meeting ended with some students sharing the tangential fields they were exploring and a brief discussion on the different pronunciations of zero .
The team was concerned that there was something wrong with the back-end of the model . The professor was insistent that the problem was probably with the lack of data . The team also speculated that their data was more challenging .
The professor thought that they were constrained by the shortage of data in the backend . Bigger companies had massive amounts of data to train their models . He recalled that they had been playing with the states in the back-end , but the results had not been too fruitful .
PhD E speculated that the recording problem probably does not have to do with noise . The difference in result with the tandem and Aurora system was too big . He suggested they could learn more by adding more data from Meeting Recorder digits .
Grad B shared some of his progress on how the modulation spectrum could speak to the intelligibility of different linguistic units . Grad C was working on reverberation and how a model may deal with varying reverberation response . The discussion ended with different pronunciation , `` O '' and `` zero '' for the digit zero .
Grad B was working with Larry Saul on factorial HMM and doing inference with them . Grad B thought that perhaps modulation spectrum could be used on features and sub-bands to advance this work .
The professor pointed out that zero is said in two ways , `` O '' and `` Zero . '' So , when recording digits , people are told which way to pronounce it .
The meeting began with an update on the HTK backend . The team was testing different numbers for Gaussian mixtures . The team then discussed how performance on the Aurora tasks was measured . The final score for Aurora was a weighted average , but it seemed that there was no practical implementation against which tasks were being measured . The VAD of the team 's existing system for Aurora was better . The team was also working on feature classification , mainly to do voice-unvoice detection . The meeting concluded with a few more updates on the Aurora project .
The feature classification had means of 0.3 for voiced and 0.59 for unvoiced on voice-unvoice , though the variance was quite high . The team was using TIMIT and was in the stage of looking for features . The professor thought that the team 's intuition was leading them to make statistical characterizations of what was missing from the spectral envelope . They could use things they were potentially losing in the smoothing process .
The professor thought that the team should go back and look at the difference between the smooth and the raw versions . He thought the team was too stuck on intuitions based on only the smooth version . He agreed that not having a smooth version could hurt the model a bit , but the team could potentially learn something that helps the model more .
PhD A informed the team that the team was looking at the difference between the mel filter and FFT spectrum , which he called the variance . The variance for voice-unvoice was high . PhD C thought that the variance was kind of artificial because it was being done using canonical mappings from TIMIT labelings .
The team thought that it was not fair to get a good VAD since there were n't enough baseline features . An MFCC would have been more appropriate , but optimizing for one meant lower scores on the other . In general , the model was better now due to lower latencies .
The professor thought that the model was better now since it had lower latencies . So , he thought that the good VAD was worth the trouble .
PhD A thought that a good VAD could not be made without baseline features . On-line normalization was not helping the model when spectral subtraction was already in play . The short filters were performing as well as the long ones , and the model was doing well on the well-matched case . Despite mixed results , the shorter latency was a positive sign .
The meeting kicked off with self-introductions , familiarizing team members and their responsibilities . After stating the scope of the project , which was to design a new remote control , the team tested out the functions of the white board . Then , the team brainstormed about what features they would add to the new remote control , such as being multi-functional and having a light sensor , with the selling price of twenty five euros and production cost of twelve fifty Euros .
The role of User Interface is to design a television remote control . Marketing is in charge of figuring out how to sell them . The responsibilities of Industrial Designer are dealing with technical and functional designs and specifications of User Interface .
The project goal was to design an original , trendy and user-friendly remote control for the international market . The project will be divided into three parts - functional , conceptual and detailed design . The selling price and the production cost of the remote should be twenty five Euros and less than twelve fifty euros respectively . The profit aim for the company is fifty million Euros .
User Interface suggested that the remote should be compact and able to be used for other purposes such as controlling air-conditioners or heating systems . Industrial Designer agreed and added audio players should also be controlled as well .
The remote should be compact with a friendly shape , like the kidney shape Project Manager proposed . It should also be made with different material and colour so as to be more trendy .
Marketing suggested that the remote can beep or a light in the remote can blink when people clap . Project Manager added that it can also give off a signal , activated by light sensors , when it is in a dark spot . However , Project Manager later raised up the point that voice or clapping was not specific enough and other devices like lamps with the same function only worked to a certain degree .
It should be a multi-functional gadget that would control all household machines , such as air conditioners and audio players so that it would be different from other kinds of remotes . Also , the remote can either blink or beep as a response to a clap or when it is in a dark spot to help the user to locate it .
In the next meeting , Industrial Manager will be responsible for the functional and working design of the remote . Marketing will be in charge of the user requirement specification such as friendliness and come up with features that justify the price of the remote .
An idea for future work was suggested during the visit of the german project manager : the possibility to use the same system for language generation . Setting up certain inputs in the Bayes-net would imply certain intentions , which would trigger dialogues . There is potential to make a conference paper out of presenting the current work and the project aspirations within a parsing paradigm . The focus should be the Bayes-net , to which all other modules interface . Situation , User , Discourse and Ontology feed into the net to infer user intentions . It was suggested that they start analysing what the Discourse and Ontology would give as inputs to the Bayes-net .
An idea for future work was suggested during the visit of the german project manager : the possibility to use the same system for language generation . Setting up certain inputs in the Bayes-net would imply certain intentions , which would trigger dialogues . Having a system able to ask questions could contribute significantly to training the belief-net . The possibility of incorporating language generation into the system will have to be discussed further .
There is potential to make a conference paper out of presenting the current work and the project aspirations within a parsing paradigm . Similarly , as no one could recall some of the points of the conference call , the group will have to meet again and define the exact structure and content of the paper they are going to submit .
The Bayes-net is going to be the focus of the presentation . In order to complete a functioning prototype of the belief-net , it was decided to start expanding the Ontology and Discourse nodes by working with a simple construction , like `` where is X ? '' . A robust analysis of such a basic utterance will indicate what the limits of the information derived from the construction are , as well as ways to design the whole module and fit other constructions in .
Project Manager introduced a new remote control project . The team started to know each other by introducing their roles in this project . Project Manager then invited everyone to raise ideas about the remote . Their discussion included its versatility , anti-loss design and possible appearance , but there was no final decision on these matters . The team agreed that the remote control should be one-handed , user-friendly and globally attractive . In addition , they noticed that these ideas should be realized under the price target and balance the stability and design sense of the remote control .
User Interface thought that changing channels is the basic function of the remote control , but can also be turned into a universal remote control . Based on the reality that the remote control is often lost in our life , he thought that they should add anti loss design into it . Marketing further proposed that tracking devices can be used , and Industrial Designer agreed that some beeps or vibrations can be added . Project Manager thought they needed to design a trendy , interesting and sturdy remote control .
User Interface proposed that they can design a fashionable and modern spherical remote controller , reduce buttons to make it simple , and connect several parts of the remote control with hinges . Marketing put forward the keyboard shape remote control , using the handle to make it more user-friendly . Project Manager further proposed the idea of a joystick keyboard .
In the design of the sphere remote control , User Interface used a hinge to connect the middle part , and a light sensor was used to avoid too many buttons . Project Manager proposed that the handle could make it more stable , but lost the features of the sphere ; in the design of the joystick keyboard , Marketing also wanted to use hinges to make the keyboard remote control more portable . Industrial Designer proposed to add a round shape under the keyboard remote control to make the remote control more user-friendly . Project Designer proposed to add sensors on both sides for users to use more conveniently .
Industrial Designer thought that the spherical remote control is easy to be thrown back and forth , which would reduce its service life and lack stability . There should be a compromise between the sense of design and stability .
The team agreed that the joystick handle must be easy to operate by one hand , with some ups and downs behind it , so as to be more user-friendly . The remote control needs to be longer to indicate the direction of the remote control . For convenience , the project manager proposed to install sensors at both ends , but the industrial designer thought that the more technology investment , the higher the cost . The numbers and buttons on the remote control can clearly indicate its direction . In addition , he proposed that it should not be too small , or it might be hard to design functions .
Project Manager proposed to price each remote control at 25 Euros . The profit aim for the team would be 50 million Euros in the first year . The market range would be international and over all age groups . The most popular and attractive remote control can be found by Marketing . Or , in terms of design , provide different designs for different target audiences in different countries .
Project Manager began a conceptual design meeting with the group , they discussed the components design , interface design at first . In the presentation , material , colour , type and supplement were referred . Then marketing shared the watch trend over the past and future , and thought young and old people 's different tastes should be taken into consideration when designed . After that , the group made a discussion about the remote control concept . The final decision about remote control was made by a round shape and green colour with speech recognition and LCD screen to appeal to the target population .
Industrial Designer expressed a desire to make remote control from rubber and LCD touch screen . Industrial Designer designed a remote control chargeable with a mount station instead of plugging it . In addition , User Interface emphasized that the remote control should not only have an LCD screen , but also some necessary buttons . Marketing introduced watch trends about colours , shapes and material of remote control from the past years . Based on the analysis of marketing , the group did a discussion about target people and made initial design decisions .
User Interface thought speech recognition function was useful because people always lost remote control . It would be easy to find with a microphone in the remote . The basic design of remote control would include volume and program icon , buttons move and mute , recognisable and scroll function in the curvy shape . This design would mainly be toward young people .
Marketing introduced watch trends in shapes , colours , material and functions from the past years . In Marketing 's data , young people prefered fruity colours , round shapes and soft material . In contrast , elderly people liked dark colours , square shapes with round edges and hard material .
User Interface designed position of normal and usual buttons such as plus , minus , sound and program . Project Manager suggested the microphone was a special point so it should be placed visibly . Then User Interface decided to put the microphone in a company logo . Marketing thought scroll was convenient , Industrial Designer agreed and designed scroll on the side . Project Manager thought remote control would be fancier with scroll .
Marketing thought it was easy with a microphone on the remote control so that it was easy to find . User Interface agreed and thought it was better to put the microphone in a corner . Industrial Designer thought no matter where the microphone was , it would not be visible . So where to place did n't matter . Project Manager thought the microphone should be in an important position to see because it was a special selling point of remote control .
At first marketing thought scroll was not as handy as buttons but Industrial Designer placed the scroll on the side and made it very handy to scroll down . In addition , Industrial Designer thought scroll could control the menu even if the remote control did not fit the screen . User Interface said young people were interested in scrolling . Project Manager thought scroll would make remote control fancier as it was interesting .
The meeting mainly focused on the functional design of the remote control . After Project Manager reviewed the last meeting briefly , Marketing made a presentation about re-envisioning the menu functionality , current technology , and interaction with other tools of the remote control by discarding unnecessary buttons and adding the speech recognition to the remote control according to market research . User Interface argued that they should discard the existing standard , and only keep the basic and user-friendly functions like channel selection , volume and enter key . The group then discussed the source of power whether to have a charger or solar power . Although solar energy was fancy and environmentally friendly , the cost was much higher than using a charger . The group faced some difficulty when deciding the target group whether for the young end or for the lower end of the age range who have more money than sense . In the next part , the group reached a consensus in terms of the keys of the remote control , which is power , channel , volume , enter , number .
Marketing tried to re-envision the remote control about the menu functionality , the current technology and the interaction with other tools based on the market research . Marketing suggested discarding unnecessary buttons and made a fancier remote control . They could also use the technology of speech recognition to help build the interaction .
Marketing held the opinion that they had to make some change on the button . According to the market research , fifty percent of users dislike the current look and feel of remote control , and only use ten percent of the buttons . More importantly , eighty percent would spend more money on a fancy remote control . The research showed that it was the time to discard some unnecessary buttons and made it fancier .
The market research showed that many people were dissatisfied with the current remote control . Therefore , it was necessary to bring new technology into the product , which could also help to get positive marketing for other tools .
User Interface argued that they should discard the existing standard , and only keep the basic and user-friendly functions like channel selection , volume and enter key . Then they talked about the conflicts between technology and price . The application of some high technology such as speech recognition and solar energy would add to the cost . Therefore , to ensure the low price of the remote control , they had to think it over when deciding whether to use speech recognition . It was also difficult for the group to select between solar energy and charger . Although solar energy was fancy and environmentally friendly , the cost was much higher than using a charger . Finally , Marketing suggested making the remote control a dock to place it .
Solar energy was not so convenient for users when using remote control at night . because it would be hard for it to store up energy . In addition , Industrial Designer had questions about the cost of adding solar energy to the remote control .
Industrial Designer argued that although Industrial Designer appreciated the idea of speech recognition , it was not practical and affordable to put the technology of speech into a cheap mass-produced device .
The meeting occurred close to the finalization of the model for Aurora . The team had put together a model and was tweaking it to see what achieves best performance . The professor suggested that it was time to make some decisions , have several constants , and then test other theories on remaining features . The neural net , for instance , was yet to come together . Still , the model was second in ranking for the task , behind the leader by only one point . The evaluation criteria for the tasks was still not completely clear , but the team seemed to be doing well .
The team had pushed their code and was curious to know if the CVS system was working well . It was , at least from Belgium . Other team members needed to come back for the team to complete a few tasks .
While remote CVS access seemed to be working , the team was unsure about setting up a CVS server on a new port . That required a password mechanism . But the team thought an anonymous CVS might be good to store transcripts as it relied on open source software .
The team wanted to know if OGI was using CVS to access the code . It seemed that they were not . No one there was working on Aurora . Though , they were expecting Sunil to grab it and start working on Aurora once he returned .
The professor informed the team that the evaluation was on November 13 . He encouraged the team to run experiments to learn which factors were the most important . The team was concerned about how the evaluation would be weighted , but they did not expect it to be significantly different . There was a chance that the evaluation would be pushed .
The Aurora staff was tinkering around with various parameters , like the insertion penalty . The professor expressed interest in knowing what the exact penalties were to make decision about the team 's models .
PhD E informed the team that Guenter was putting the Wall Street Journal data on the team 's disks . There was a lot of data so it would take some time to run the models .
The meeting discussed the progress of the transcription , the DARPA demos , tools to ensure meeting data quality , data standardization , backup tools , and collecting tangential meeting information . The team was making good progress on the transcription but was still concerned with correcting some of the data . Besides that , they were working on adapting the THISL GUI for their project and figuring out visual tools for meeting participants to help them know when their recording equipment was failing . The team also discussed collecting additional information , like laughter and breath data as well as meeting notes .
The team had started moving to XML as their general format to standardize their data . Though , there is still concern about the limitations of XML . The participants noted that sometimes the mic of one subject catches sound from another . They also discussed implementing tools to help participants know when the quality of their audio is bad .
The team agreed that it was important to keep good backups . Their main concern was the time difference between getting more disks and recording new meetings . They did not want to rely on burning CD 's at all because of potential loss of data . They also started discussing whether it would be a good idea to collect meeting notes from the participants as well , but that would entail installing new infrastructure .
Grad H brought up that they were standardizing the data in XML , though Grad H was not satisfied with the current data format . Grad H was also building tools to extract information from XML 's in various languages , mainly Java and Perl .
Grad G thought that it would be important to collect seat information in the key files to know where someone was sitting . This would be useful when people had to be bleeped out upon being heard in someone else 's microphone . Grad G wanted to figure out what seating arrangements led to other participants ' voices showing up in the microphone .
Grad G thought that it would be helpful to let the participants conveniently bleep things out during the meeting . While synchronizing bleeps from during the meeting would require some infrastructure , a faster version could be set up . Though , G did think that the synchronization infrastructure would be a useful addition .
The postdoc thought that it was a good idea to collect digital notes during the meeting in principle , but was concerned about the noise it would add to the mic . Postdoc thought that notes could even be taken after the meeting , by transcribers . All in all , he thought notes were useful for generating summaries .
The meeting was about the impact of Brexit on the capacity of Wales ' higher education system and some future risk assessments for the higher education institutions . The group discussed some current problems caused by Brexit , and the efforts they have made for current and future risks , on discussing the Brexit 's impact on program Eramus and international mobility . Finally , the group discussed the financial funding barriers and future financial forecast for Wales ' higher education system .
First , the economic impact of Brexit is shown in a number of ways , like the extent to which the HE sector in Wales is exposed to sources of income that are located from the EU . We can also see some changes in students ' applications and in increasing difficulties of the EU collaborative research activities . In terms of the financial impact , if it is accepted that the UK is a net contributor to the EU then , presumably , some of Wales ' money will go straight into politics , and the benefits are unknown , which will become a matter of politics . In terms of recruitment , both European Union-domiciled applicants to Wales and non-EU international students decreased , who applied to Welsh institutions . While the number for both groups of students who apply to English universities increased .
The funding position would be the main pressure . The recommendations for re-establishing funding at Welsh institutions are expected to take quite a bit longer . Wales institutions are still funding at a lower level . Then , as for enrollments , there is also the start of a reduction , both in Welsh-domiciled and English-domiciled applications to Wales . And finally , the uncertainty about potential consequences that could arise from the review in England of fees and funding—the Augar review .
He thinks there may be two reasons . The first one is about the change in student support arrangements for EU students , which will have an effect of perturbation . Wales ' institutions ' fee level is slightly lower , but they do struggle in terms of the Anglocentric nature of the media and so on . The other dimension is about the attractiveness of the higher institutions in a highly competitive recruitment market . Wales universities do n't have enough investment in facilities , and particularly buildings and kits .
One of the reasons is relative safety , Wales is a comfortable and safe place to be . Then , being part of a UK system is also an important message there as well . Students enjoy a UK-quality system , a UK degree , and the strength of that brand is available in Wales , and they can be safer and more supportive in Wales .
According to Mr. Blaney , there 's a Welsh Government HE Brexit working group , providing early summaries of the risks and the potential impact , in terms of the exposure of the sector to EU-sourced funding . Beyond that , the working group will also share the work that institutions are doing individually to look at how they would respond to different scenarios , which has n't been implemented yet .
According to Mr. Blaney , there are two dimensions . Fee and access plans are approved annually by Mr. Blaney 's group . They go through their financial sustainability , which is based on their forecasts and data . And also , the fee plans themselves make assumptions about how many students of different types are going to be recruited . Unless the institutions can find other students , and they will reduce the amount of investment in the various activities that are identified in the fee plans .
They touched on contingency plans , which also focus on promotion and look for additional or increased sources of funding , and touched on strengthening the Global Wales engagement in order to sell Wales . The other sector that they worked on is the funding of infrastructure . So they worked with UK universities to make arguments at UK Government level .
Bethan Owen thinks that they can advise based on visible data and information and on their judgment . The big thing in this whole Brexit scenario contains so much uncertainty . And according to Dr David Blaney , they have varied links into institutions , having lots of conversations , getting information for the assessment about the financial sustainability of the institutions , assessing governance and management levels and foreseeing challenges .
According to Bethan Owen , seven of the universities are referring to mobility , so they are including an element of it from their own income and fee and access income . However , Erasmus is such a well-established and long-term plan that to implement anything similar to it would be much less efficient and much more costly , so replacing it would be a challenge .
They were the first of the funding councils in the UK to have a memorandum of understanding with the National Union of Students in Wales , ahead of the rest of the UK in requiring all HE providers to have student charters and there are elements of student protection within the student charter . They 're also requiring further education institutions who are regulated and deliver higher education to do similar or the same , and that 's very important .
The biggest is that there 's an issue about investment . The quality of the research base in Welsh universities and the productivity of that Welsh research base are both good , there 's just not enough of them . If they want to be able to play into the UK-wide research funding , the investment has two dimensions . One is having enough researchers playing in larger projects rather than small-scale projects ; and the second thing is that , compared to UK-wide research pots , Wales ' core research funding is not competitive . Also , the Welsh sector has not been sufficiently focused on getting in on the conversations with the research councils .
First of all , whether the Brexit deal might impact adversely on the capacity of the collaborations is still unknown . But we 've mentioned playing into Horizon Europe , and being able to continue with that would be an important part of that capacity . Wales should maintain the quality , maintain the impact , and hopefully grow the critical mass . Dr David Blaney thinks that they are already showing dividends in terms of the capacity to win more research funding , and to establish an even stronger presence in the international research market .
The team got warmed-up through the opening drawing game which also works as the tool training process . The meeting was primarily composed of discussions among team members on potential functions and designs of remote controls based on their own life experiences . By then , feasibilities on budgets and demographic marketing strategies were also taken into consideration which influence greatly the potential functions and designs .
Firstly the group confirmed that their target is a TV remote control . Marketing expects the control to be produced in medium size . User Interface indicated that the control should have a simple practical interface , without a great amount of buttons . Project Manager intended to relate the control with other devices like DVD , HI-FI , video , etc . And the team agreed on the inexpensiveness of the control .
Project Manager had an idea of the insertion of LCD display screen on the remote control , which may possess different pages for different devices . However , they reaffirmed the budget of twenty-five per unit and decided to be realistic with the budget .
Marketing believed that an ideal remote control should compress 3-4 different controllers in a thin combination . Users can switch controllers by sliding or flipping . Industrial Designer proposed a two-sided controller and said that he could keep it simple on one side and complicated on the other side .
Industrial Designer and Project Manager proposed the two-sided remote control , whose one side could be designed for kids and the other for adults . However , in this way , User Interface prospected a potential hard manipulation .
Project Manager proposed the design of a flip telephone which could help solve this problem . When the controller is flipped open , users got all the buttons ; while basic buttons are on the cover . The team reached an agreement on it .
Marketing proposed the design of a lid to avoid accidental pressing and touching . Project Manager proposed the design of a lock which could increase safety insurance for kids .
Project Manager asked the team members give personal introductions respectively to get acquainted with each other , and then introduced a new remote control project . Before discussing the product-related issues , the manager asked the members to get acquainted with the SMARTboards for further presentation and information sharing work by drawing in turns . After the drawing session , the manager reemphasized the program target and required the remote control to possess with a user-familiarized feature . Other group members voiced out additional design aspects , including usability and lightness . Finally , the team agreed on both the selling and the production price .
The user interface asked what the project 's target was . In response , the project manager emphasized that the target was a TV remote control . Then , the group members voiced out their envision of the product . The user interface suggested that the TV remote control should stick to what people are familiar with . At last , the user interface and industrial manager added usability and lightness as two other essential features of the product .
The user interface believed that changes , be them rational or revolutionary , once made , would be hindrances to customers ' usage .
As TV was becoming central in most homes , the user interface thought that the design of the remote control should cater to the needs of different kinds of customers , even including that of the disabled people . Besides , the industrial manager thought that lightness is another essential feature of the design .
The manager introduced a new technical device , the SMARTboards , to all the team members in order to facilitate their presentation and information sharing work . Then he asked the team to draw animals respectively to get acquainted with the device . Each member chooses a different animal , embodying their opinions upon the product .
Firstly , he thought that dolphin represents freedom . Besides , he loved the ocean a lot and swam a lot in his spare time .
The industrial manager thought that tigers always went for security , speed and efficiency . These features were also the guidelines in designing the products .
The meeting was mainly about the Welsh baccalaureate . The committee began with the value of the baccalaureate . There have been young people who entered universities with a baccalaureate qualification . The goal of the committee was to further refine the qualification to balance it with other qualifications that had been recognized by universities and school leaders such as A-Levels . The grading system has been admitted to be rigorous . Students were expected to be evaluated on their individual ability . Although universities showed ambivalent attitudes towards the baccalaureate , its advantage could not be denied . The committee aimed to aid financially in the Welsh schools in organizing the baccalaureate and offering its corresponding courses of high quality .
Kirsty Williams admitted that the grading system was rigorous and equivalent to A-Level . A UCAS tariff associated with it , and it was the individual ability that was evaluated by the system . About the resit issue , the committee agreed that WJEC and the Qualifications Wales was supposed to regulate this .
Kirsty Williams assured the committee members that the grading system was rigorous and it focused on the students ' ability to think independently . When Dawn Bowden challenged the value of the Welsh baccalaureate , Kirsty Williams defended its qualification by demonstrating its tariff for UCAS . He reiterated that the evaluation engaged and expanded the acquisition of knowledge and skills .
Suzy Davies doubted that teachers might not pay enough attention to students ' preparation for the baccalaureate and were prone to `` spoon-feed '' . Kirsty Williams , however , pointed out that this was unlikely to happen , for different from the A-Levels which graded students under the particular syllabus of each subject , the baccalaureate evaluated the personal project and the ability of independent thinking .
The committee members disagreed on the universities ' attitudes . Hefin David pointed out that according to the response of an online survey , universities such as Cardiff University refused to consider the baccalaureate as a fair substitute for a full A-Level . However , Kirsty Williams claimed that he had a personal commitment to establishing the recognition of the baccalaureate with the universities and almost all Welsh universities recognized the baccalaureate as a qualification . In the end , despite the ambivalent attitudes of universities , the committee had to admit that the admissions practice was decided by universities and the baccalaureate qualification still required refinement .
No , Kirsty Williams still showed confidence in the value of the baccalaureate . Despite the committee members ' provision of contradictory evidence , he emphasized the importance of the communication with universities . Kirsty Williams believed that the baccalaureate was a beneficial endeavour for students to undertake before their entrance to the universities , rather than a detriment .
Andrew Clark thought the inconsistency reflected the different ways that universities treat the skill challenge certificates and the baccalaureate , whose prime focus was individual ability . He added that the universities ' attitudes had changed significantly since there was a graded qualification , for even those who did not make the baccalaureate part of their offer considered it a valuable sign that young people were prepared to go to university .
The committee members expressed their hope that all schools would be able to organize the baccalaureate , as well as its corresponding training courses . Via their professional programs , there would be more available support for teachers to ensure that they had the skills and the confidence to deliver the qualification in a high-quality manner . Financial support would be provided as well .
Kirsty Williams explained to the committee members that the funding would go via consortia to schools . Individual schools had the right to plan independently in which aspects they would spend the money in order to meet the professional learning needs of their staff . Thus , if the schools realized that they had particular needs for the baccalaureate , they would spend the money in the area to seek improvement .
Kirsty Williams admitted that the qualification examinations would bring pressure to students . In fact , as he pointed out , students were prone to form a wrong impression that the more they had achieved , the more successful they would get . Thus , he expressed his desire to guide the students to make the right decisions in terms of their A-Levels and baccalaureate .
Janet Finch-Saunders worried about the narrowing of the curriculum at Key Stage 4 . Kirsty Williams assured her that the skill challenge certificate actually ensured a broad variety of choices available . He added that the Qualifications Wales had reviewed into the qualification to see whether the teachers were too onerous and if there was any duplication in students ' examinations . As for the Welsh learners who chose England institutions instead of Welsh ones , Kirsty Williams explained that the reasons behind might be various and hard to quantify .
Kirsty Williams admitted that the crossing and moves were happening and did not deny the evidence as Sian Gwenllian implied . On the contrary , he believed that the reason behind the crossing was complicated and hard to quantify . He exemplified some of them : the eagerness to adjust to the English system , the nature of the offer ( the combination of the A-Levels that institution offered ) , etc . In conclusion , Kirsty Williams believed that no effective evidence could demonstrate that the avoidance of the baccalaureate was the sole driver for the students choices to move to other areas .
On the topic of teachers ' training , Kirsty Williams quoted from the ITE programmes that Teachers should be able to help children and young people to make links across their learning , bringing together different aspects to examine important topics such as citizenship , enterprise , financial capability and sustainability . The shifts in pedagogical principles were expected accordingly .
Project manager asked team members to present themselves . After that , project manager announced that the goal of the project was to design a new , trendy and user-friendly remote control , which would be sold all over the world . Project manager wanted to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro and expected profit would be around fifty million Euro . Then team members were asked to get used to the whiteboard by writing down their favourite animals . Besides , they were also asked to share their ideas and good or bad experiences about remote controls . From their point of view , remote controls with too many buttons or without backlight are hard to use . A potential-meter for volume control was also necessary . Remote control working with radio waves was better than that working with infra-red rays . At the end of the meeting , project manager had assigned tasks to team members .
Firstly , remote control without backlight was inconvenient to use in the dark room . Secondly , the industrial designer preferred a potential-meter for volume control instead of two buttons .
Interface developer was asked to work on the design of the remote control . User interface designer was asked to work on the technical functions of the remote control while marketing was responsible for finding the user requirements for the remote control .
Users ca n't change the volume rapidly by using two discrete buttons for volume . While by using a potential-meter or a slider , the user can mute it down or make a high volume in one second .
The project manager considered that the goal of the new remote control project was to design a new and original remote control which is trendy and user-friendly . He wanted its price to be 25 Euro and it would be sold all over the world .
When there are many buttons on the remote control , it 's hard to see each buttons ' function and it 's hard to press small buttons . Remote control without backlight was inconvenient to use in a dark room . Remote control without a potential-meter for volume control could n't be used to mute the TV down or make a high volume in a second . When using remote control working with infra-red rays , users should keep it in a specific direction and it 's hard to tune .
Because it was hard to see which button did what when there were many buttons on the remote control . And the buttons were too small to press .
The meeting took place close to the finalization of the model , so participants were focused on further experimentation they could conduct . It began with a discussion about how the backend system could be further improved . The team thought that perhaps they could tweak language scaling and insertion penalties to see how the model changed its performance . Then , the team moved into discussing methods for detecting voice segments in their results . Finally , the team spent some time exploring normalization techniques and acoustic events , both of which could potentially improve model performance .
Grad D was focused on filing his taxes . He explained to the team that he had both Canadian and US income , so he had to file taxes in both countries for the preceding year .
Grad D thought that his tax returns were taking too much time . He had started writing code for his work , however . He was expecting that his taxes would be easier next year , since he would not have to declare his Canadian income .
The professor initially suggested that not making too much money made taxes easier . He learned that Canada wants taxes from Grad D. He also wanted to know if the same would hold for the coming year .
Grad A explained that he was trying to collect a set of acoustic events to help distinguish between various linguistic features . The team distinguished between acoustic features and acoustic events . Acoustic events were a feature of the acoustic signal that could be derived from the data .
PhD F explained the difference between acoustic features and acoustic events . Acoustic features are what linguists talk about whereas acoustic events are measurable properties of the acoustic signal , like its height .
The professor recalled that the SPAM work had something similar to acoustic events , auditory events . He also informed the team that Professors Kollmeier and Professor Kleinschmidt will be visiting for six months , and they may know more about this topic .
Project Manager started introducing meeting purposes on the functional design of the remote control . Group mates have agreed to name the project as 'Mando ' . Next , Marketing presented user requirements and market reports on current remote improvements . User Interface presented the current trend on remote controls . User Interface compared scroll wheel and LCD screen . Industrial Interface gave a presentation on the working design of different interfaces . Lastly , Project Manager summarized the whole project meeting discussion .
The group agreed that the remote should be fancy and easy to be hand-held . It should not be too small or too big in good shape . They agreed to bring new technologies and push toward the internet for young peoples . So they would use the wheel to navigate . Also regarding the budget , they had a new target price but it would be impossible to have LCD and automatic speech recognition technologies implementation .
Industrial Designer thought a universal shape design should be good for both the hands . User Interface suggested that they could still design to extend past the hand and have something like finger grips on the remote compared to the traditional ones . Marketing supplemented that it should not be symmetrical . And Project Manager agreed on it .
Marketing mentioned that most of the young people to thirty years old were interested in this kind of technology . However , Project Manager updated him and group mates that head offices would like to restrict the remote control to TV only because of time limitations . Therefore , Project Manager suggested the group focusing more on the internet aspects because the teletext was outdated and it should be clear that the corporate image should be clearly identified in the product .
When User Interface mentioned about they need to keep the buttons down to a minimum , Marketing thought the transition to this new remote control should n't be very abrupt because if people would think it 's very difficult to learn a remote control without numbers . User Interface responded that it would depend on how they advertise it to navigate to a program without the numbers .
User Interface suggested that the scroll wheel could be used without an LCD screen for changing channel numbers easily . And it would be fairly cheap to implement compared to an LCD screen . Project Manager mentioned that , however , they had seen that there was a new way of interacting that used wheels to navigate . So Project Manager suggested that regarding the cost budget they had a target price , their design could stick to new technologies that bring to young people .
User Interface thought that sometimes the speech recognition interrupted people when there was a dialogue on the TV program . Unless the remote control could be made to not have to pick up any more , that would be a useful feature of speech recognition . Project Manager was not keen on it because Project Manager was not confident they would have a product that was able to work . However , Marketing thought that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper than the LCD and people must buy it with twenty-five Euros .
The meeting was with the Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic . First of all , petitioners presented several petitions including to call the government to implement a wage supplement . Later the committee expressed the thanks to different departments and people for the contribution to the society under the Covid-19 situation . When it came to questions , the committee discussed the financial support from the government to various industries as well as groups to ensure equal rights of different groups of people , especially the most vulnerable ones . Moreover , the meeting discussed the new law in Hong Kong and issues related to community services in Canada . In the end , the committee discussed the recent and upcoming solutions to battle the Covid-19 concerning various aspects .
The petitioners had asked the government to implement a wage supplement as a temporary measure to bring the wages for those who were in contact with the general public and working in what had been deemed an essential service to no less than $ 20 an hour , in light of their service and the risks they were taking for all Canadians .
Mr. Blake Richards suggested that Tourism Week in Canada , the annual celebration was a time to recognize the contributions and experiences of Canada 's tourism industry . The ongoing coronavirus crisis had closed provincial and international borders to recreational travel , and tourism operators from coast to coast had been among the first and hardest hit due to the government-mandated lockdowns . The 1.8 million Canadians whose jobs depended on a thriving tourism sector were counting on it .
Hon . Larry Bagnell ( Yukon , Lib . ) suggested that as a great historic Canadian event last week , Yukon became home to Canada 's first university north of 60 . Yukon University would provide Yukoners with educational opportunities closer to home , expand the research capabilities and expertise on the Arctic and climate change and allow those who want to study northern and first nations governance to do so in the north .
Ms. Anju Dhillon would like to thank the members of the Canadian Armed Forces for their invaluable assistance in the long-term care facilities . Since many seniors , the most vulnerable ones desperately needed them and they had offered great assistance .
Hon . Chrystia Freeland suggested that after what it had been learned this week , all options must be on the table when it came to how care for the elders would be provided in Canada in the future . Currently , it is clear to all that root-and-branch reform was necessary . All participants would need to act with speed but not haste , and work with the provincial partners .
Mrs. Karen Vecchio joined critics from the NDP , the Bloc and the Green Party who delt with women 's issues and gender equality to ask where the $ 75 million toward sexual exploitation and human trafficking had gone . As a result of financial shortage , last week organizations had to close their doors and the programs that helped vulnerable women and girls . Hon . Bill Blair ( Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness ) introduced that the government had launched a new , comprehensive national strategy to combat human trafficking , and had incorporated a new pillar in that strategy of empowerment to ensure that focus .
Hon . Mary Ng suggested that Canada , with our international partners in the U.S. , Australia and the U.K. , made a joint statement in which countries were expressing deep concern regarding China 's imposition of a new security law for Hong Kong . Moreover , with hundreds of thousands of Canadians living in Hong Kong , the government had a vested interest in Hong Kong 's stability and prosperity , the foundations of which were Hong Kong 's relative autonomy and basic freedoms . Canada would always support and promote freedom of speech , freedom of expression and freedoms of the press around the world .
Hon . Carla Qualtrough ( Minister of Employment , Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion ) said that it could be confirmed that the government would increase the wage subsidies for Canada student jobs . The program had added flexibilities , including the ability to have part-time work and the ability to have the jobs extended until February of next year . That said , the budget was not changed . It remains at 70,000 job placements for 70,000 students , with 100 % of them being subsidized at 100 % .
Hon . Steven Blaney questioned that the Canada emergency student benefit did not encourage young people to go to work , and employers had difficulty hiring them . Yet they had applied for the Canadasummer jobs program . Hon . Carla Qualtrough ensured the committee that the member opposite was not implying that offering young people income support that they took out of necessity would make them not want to work . The reason why the government was creating these additional jobs beyond the Canada summer jobs program was the young people wanted to serve the community .
Hon . Catherine McKenna started by introducing the $ 33 billion infrastructure program in which the government was working directly with the Government of Quebec to build infrastructure that was making a huge difference , including projects in the member 's riding . Moreover , the change of management at the Canada Infrastructure Bank marked a new phase in the development of the bank . The government was working to build a modern , public infrastructure , to create jobs , and to make Canada more competitive internationally .
Hon . Chrystia Freeland introduced that the government was very committed to removing barriers to interprovincial trade . It was something that we have been working on with the premiers . Obviously the coronavirus has taken precedence in recent weeks , but it 's a priority . It was the right thing to do . The government had been meeting every week for more than two months , to be focusing on the urgent threat posed by the coronavirus to ensure that there would be no delay .
Mr. Daniel Blaikie asked about the government 's guidance towards people who felt that their workplace was not safe at this time and that their employer had not done its due diligence , and were concerned about losing access to the CERB . Hon.Carla Qualtrough suggested that the government were working very closely with the provinces on occupational health and safety guidelines and taking an all-of-government approach to ensure that workers were safe and that the government could support them in these efforts .
The team members met up for the first time to discuss the new remote control for the television . Each member introduced themselves and agreed that the product should be designed to be user-friendly . Industrial designer then proposed that the marketing plan is for the product to be fashionable and attractive . Project manager listed several subjects in need of settlement before the further discussion , including functional design , time frame , budget , product introduction marketing strategic plan and benefits for the company as well as the individuals , before he suggested more interaction among teams .
By taking the example of iPod , Industrial Designer believed that the remote control should be fashionable so that people can instantly recognize its value and have the urge to possess one .
By doing research on other companies ' design and ideas , Marketing pointed out that the market the remote control aimed at should be a fairly large one and that the product itself should have a brand new , attractive design and be simple to use .
Marketing pointed out that the remote control for television should be user-friendly , with a visual feature to draw the attention of customers and that new ideas should be put into thought on facilitating its usage , so that users could avoid spending too much time on the instruction menu .
Project manager needed the following subjects to be presented in writing form , including functional and technical design , team scale , timeline , initial budget , cost limit , marketing strategic plan , product introduction , benefits for the company and for each individual . These matters should be determined before further discussion .
Because by the time the Industrial Designer introduced his product in a more thorough way , there would be a competition . Moreover , Project Manager made this request so that he could submit the documentation to the management . He hopes , in addition , that all the emails or other copies of discussions could be kept so that each member could be informed about the project proceeding .
Project manager expressed his hope that Marketing could interact more frequently with the Industrial Designer Christine within her team , so that the two departments of sales and finance could coordinate with each other . Additionally , he would like all the teams worked together in order to take all the factors into account .
The meeting started off with Marketing leading the discussion on product positioning of the remote , which was going to be an impulse purchase and certain requirements from management , such as the remote only controlling the television . Then , Industrial Designer shared the working design and main components of the remote . Also , they discussed functions that they would add to the remote such as a child lock and the appearance of the remote , such as having a comfortable shape and different colours . User Interface then raised some features that the remote ought to have such as having a timer . Finally , Project Manager stated their target group , which was people aged ten to forty , and they discussed how to cater to their needs , such as having large buttons for the elderly .
The main function is to only control the function of a television at a far off distance . The signal released from the remote through radio waves or infrared can change different functionalities in the television . There should be a timer to set for viewing a particular program or for switching on or off a particular program or lock the television to save electricity according to the user 's choice . A child lock system should be added .
The buttons on the remote , installed with infrared bulbs , would be fluorescent whenever the TV is on , so users can find the remote even in the dark . Also , the buttons can glow differently according to different functions . The remote will beep if too many buttons are pressed at once . The team agreed to add a display clock , which can also be used as an alarm clock . The idea of having teletext and controlling electronic products of the whole house was rejected .
Marketing said that there is a lot of argument to make one button for one feature because research results show that users complain about how hard it is to learn a new one . This idea might be suitable for people working with computers all the time but the elderly with an arthritic hand might find it difficult . User Interface suggested that it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities and be in the shape of the letter T for more compatibility .
It would be an attractive impulse purchase which would be out in the market by September as a Christmas present of twenty five Euros . It would be for everybody who has a TV , mainly aged ten to forty . In the subgroups of the target group , there are elderly people who have limited functions with their fingers and hands and nervous people who can not press a little button unless it is very clear . To make the remote sellable , it should be intuitive and easy to use in order to shorten the learning curve . It could be sold with a slogan .
The corporate colour and design are recommended to be used on the product . The remote could be in different colours such as pink or banana yellow and shapes such as a fun shape like animal shapes or a comfortable shape that fits the hand but no sharp projections , lest a child plays with it . The idea of buttons with various shapes such as a triangle for volume and square for channels was considered . Everyone agreed that the text on the remote should be clear and the remote should be compact .
Project Manager suggested that the remote could have removable plastic cases like phones so users can change to the colour they like , for example , striped or fluorescent blue . Two cases can be provided in the package and users can buy new cases in stores for a few Francs or Euros . The team immediately jumped on board with the idea .
The remote control would have a chip in the integrated circuit , taking power from the battery and transforming input from buttons through wires into infrared signals to electronic devices . There will be buttons and underneath them are switches and bulbs . To hold everything in , there should be a case and a remote holder . The material used for the remote should be human friendly so that it will not cause any skin disease or allergy to either children or adults . The frequency of each electronic device is different so it would be very difficult to design a control for multiple devices .
User Interface suggested adding specific functional buttons for children or the elderly or people with nervous problems . Industrial Designer replied that it would n't cost much . Project Manager suggested that they can make forty percent of the remotes with large buttons and regular buttons for the rest . To sum it up , if the budget permits , they can address some features for certain subgroups .
This meeting was about the conceptual design of the remote control . Firstly , groupmates presented on the conceptual specification on components , properties and materials as well as a conceptual specification on user interface design . Also , they suggested conceptual designs including the buttons , the circuit board , the chip to print as well as the LCD screen with backlighting in the device . Then , the group had a discussion on the final remote control concepts . So , they decided to have changeable covers in fruity colours , rechargeable batteries and scroll wheels . And they would leave the spongy case and the standard of the chip to be discussed in the next meeting .
The first presentation mainly covered component design . Industrial Designer introduced what should be the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery made of and what they should look like . The second presentation was about properties and materials . User Interface advocated an LCD with backlighting in a small device . The third presentation was trend watching given by Marketing . So Marketing suggested space materials or the LCD screen because they stressed fashion , simplicity and technology innovation . Also , Marketing did n't suggest that spongy material was necessary .
Project Manager thought a spongy remote would be easier on the hands , while Industrial Designer thought a latex case was hard to protect the stuff inside . Due to the discussion about repetitive stress injuries mentioned before , they did n't want to go for the spongy remote . Marketing supplemented that grippable thing was more than like sinking into the hands , so Marketing preferred the material like the one people have when sitting on a bicycle .
When the group was discussing the four or five buttons around the scroll wheels , Marketing mentioned how to achieve going back to the menu with few buttons for main things if someone was changing the brightness . So User Interface thought that LCD screens might be a good theory , but not as useful in practice because people would not want to look down at the LCD screen and then back up at the television .
Firstly , the group discussed whether they could have changeable covers of different fruit and vegetable colours . Secondly , they had a discussion on the energy , the case and the chip . Then , group mates decided to have latex in fruity colours , a chip , a menu button to scroll as well as on-off buttons .
Group mates agreed that the kinetic battery was awesome as long as they considered the cost and the reliability because it was more expensive than a regular battery . Also , groupmates suggested if they could use a cheaper chip , then they could even out the cost of this good kinetic battery technology .
When the group was talking about the scroll wheel could be for changing the volume , User Interface thought it would not work for changing the channel because they really need buttons for changing a channel . So User Interface suggested the group could make a decision on it while they talked about the case .
The focus of the meeting was on a presentation of the work done already on the building of the Bayes-net . The complete prototype of the Bayes-net will be presented in the next meeting . After that , it will be possible to define interfaces and a dummy construction parser , in order to test and link modules together .
The input layer deriving information from things like the user and situation models , feeds into a set of decision nodes , such as the Enter/View/Approach ( EVA ) endpoint . In any particular situation , most of the outputs will not be relevant to the given context . Therefore , they will either have to be pruned a posteriori , or only a subset of the possible decision nodes will be computed in each occasion .
Due to most outputs not being relevant to the given context , they will either have to be pruned a posteriori , or only a subset of the possible decision nodes will be computed in each occasion . The latter option could follow a binary search-tree approach and it could also be better in computational terms . In any case , on what basis the `` winner '' output is chosen is not clear .
The presented Bayes-net takes inputs from the Situation , User , Discourse and Ontology models . There are several values ( elements ) defined in each of these models . The inputs are fed into the belief-net , which , in turn , outputs the posterior probabilities for the values of all the decision nodes . These comprise `` Go-there '' , `` EVA '' , `` Info-on '' , `` Location '' , `` Timing '' , etc . At this stage , all the decision nodes are evenly weighted : regardless of the context , each output is trusted equally . Input and output node structure was presented in XML , as this is the format that will be used for the system . A large number of the value probabilities have already been set .
As an extension to the previous discussion , this meeting basically dealt with the functional design of the remote control , for which User Interface , Marketing and Industrial Design respectively gave presentations on user requirement specification , subjects ' main frustrations and expectations for remote controls and technical design . Subsequent to individual presentations , Project Manager then presented the new requirements from the management board , based on which the decisions on the needed functions of the remote control were made and the pre-arrangement of the next meeting was subsequently told .
Marketing mainly focused on users ' frustrations and expectations for remote controls . Apart from the requirements for a fancier look , shock-resistance , and limited but usable buttons , other expectations were also raised by users , such as the need to be found , to easily use , to light in the dark , and the need of ergonomic design . Moreover , LCD and speech recognition also seemed important , especially for people between 15 and 25 who watched TV a lot . Last but not least , the previous plan for a generic remote control for everything failed due to the imbalance between the long developing time and the timely need to be on the market .
User Interface agreed with Marketing 's proposal of more ergonomic design and mentioned that a strange position of using computers might well end in tendonitis and hurt one 's wrist .
Considering the message from the management board , Project Manager emphasized the marketing competitiveness of remote controls over the costly and time-consuming need for making a generic remote control for everything . Therefore , the plan for a generic one was cancelled .
Industrial Designer first briefly described the components of the remote control , including a battery power supply , a user interface , an array of push buttons or a LCD , an electronic chip , an infrared component , and a UC as the central unit . Subsequent to the brief description , Industrial Designer pointed out the eight-month-long time problem for designing speech recognition , while the designing time for the standard one button was only one month . Moreover , Industrial Designer proposed the idea of configuring remote controls for the expert users and could better fit the market .
User Interface proposed a paradox here . On the one hand , being simple and easy to use might be achieved at the price of losing individuality ; on the other hand , being individual unavoidably meant that everybody must learn to use it first .
Project Manager considered easy-to-use and easy-to-find as the two main frustrations in designing remote controls . But at the same time , such frustrations may pronounce a serious competitive advantage for the project without making too complex stuff or using too much time to develop .
The team began the meeting by discussing the logistics of setting up the interface for data collection . Some members ran a trial of it earlier and found someone who would make a suitable wizard . The team shared concern about how they would recruit non-university student participants . Grad D introduced the team to the second iteration of the bayes-net model and its schemas . Then , the discussion moved onto controlling the size of the bayes-net as it would otherwise be based on too much information . The team ended the meeting by delving into how the method of creating a Bayes-net in different scenarios could itself be abstracted , i.e . narrowing the input and output factors and the intermediate representation .
The team listened to a recording of the interface 's trial run . Litonya was asked to be the first subject of the interface and Fey acted as the wizard . The team was happy with Fey 's performance and decided to hire her . Upon Fey 's suggestion , they also decided that the wizard should be introduced in a more appropriate fashion . The team also agreed that the run was too long at 5 minutes .
Grad C was concerned that the same person acting as the wizard and computer system might not be the best idea . Grad D had some way of making the wizard and computer seem distinct even though both were voiced by the same person and told Grad C that the recording would clarify things .
The Professor was very supportive of the idea of hiring Fey . He thought that it would be helpful since she was also willing to take over the task of organizing subjects . In addition , he believed the project would provide her with a valuable learning experience for her own upcoming graduate school work in experimental paradigms .
The team was concerned that the combinatorial input that would result from the various linguistic and contextual schemas would be enormous for the Bayes net . The Professor suggested that it 's best to narrow down the decision variables , perhaps by studying the trade-offs between different input factors . The team thought that perhaps they could keep the kinds of objects in the environment to a small subset and make rules governing actions around those objects .
The professor was the one to raise the issue and suggested that a knowledge engineering trick could be used to narrow down inputs . He thought that perhaps adding deterministic rules to properties that have actions would be helpful and the property types could be retrieved from the ontology .
Grad D thought that the best way would be to add restrictive action types that are attached to the kind of object . For instance , there are specific actions that would be relevant to a landmark .
Meeting participants wanted to agree upon a standard database to link up different components of the transcripts . The current idea was to use an XML script , but it quickly seemed that other options , like a pfile or ATLAS , are more suitable . The reason being that they would make it easier to deal with different linguistic units , like frames and utterances . Eventually , the team was skeptical of using something that would be hard to learn , like ATLAS . Nonetheless , they wanted to explore their options . The meeting finished with some discussion about handling annotations .
C developed an XML format that links together utterances based on time tags , essentially creating a lattice . The XML format would be divided into many sections , each with its own ID and timeline tag . The XML format could be modified to deal with smaller linguistic units since that would only entail changing the timestamps . Despite being easy to use , the format was not efficient for smaller linguistic units , like phones . It would work for word units , at best .
F was concerned about how the time labels would adjust to smaller phonetic units . F inquired if the time boundaries could be changed by propagating new information throughout the XML . F thought that they could configure different XML files to deal with different units , but it would lead to large file sizes .
A had seen an example of this kind of XML format before . A thought that the time boundaries were nicely handled but believed that smaller linguistic units would drain too much memory . It was essentially like a lattice , in his opinion . Though , A did not seem too concerned with dealing with smaller linguistic units since the problem would not be encountered frequently .
Since the team is familiar with Perl and a flat file format is easier , it was suggested that the cost of learning a new framework , like ATLAS , might be too high . It was suggested that ATLAS be used for the external file representation initially , and if it seems suitable , then it should be adopted in its entirety . P files were also discussed but the problem with them was that they could still get pretty big .
C thought that other options have a big learning curve , which should be taken into account , and that a flat format works well . A flat file format may not be fast , but everyone can handle it . C believed that quick and dirty solutions should be balanced with long-term infrastructural solutions . For instance , Perl can be paired with external representations of ATLAS files to create a working system . C also suggested that alternatives to P files might be interesting too , though the disadvantage would , once again , be the learning curve .
F wanted to ensure that prosodic features could be dealt with at the level of small linguistic units . F proposed that they be attached to the word or segment level with the option of extracting smaller units . This would allow the team to keep what they have without starting over .
The project manager gave a brief review of the last meeting . After the Industrial Designer 's presentation about the components of the remote and team 's discussion about it , the team agreed that the kinetic power supply , simple push buttons and a simple circuit board and a finder feature are better choices for the remote . Then , the team discussed the design of the remote . They made the decision that standard rubber case and rubber buttons and a single curve are better choices for the remote , and the shape of buttons should be simple .
Industrial Designer gave a presentation about his findings on each of the components of the remote control . Then the team discussed the power supply , buttons , circuit board and speech recognition system of the remote . They finally agreed that they should use a kinetic power supply , simple push buttons and a simple circuit board . And a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature would be a better choice .
Industrial Designer suggested that simple push buttons just require a simple chip , so that would keep the cost of the remote down .
User Interface thought that there were many remotes that already had the function of voice recognition , so it was better not to compete with that sort of remote and to find a different viewpoint of finding the lost control . She believed that a finder function rather than a speech function would be a better choice for their remote .
The team discussed the material of the remote and the shape of the buttons . They finally made the decision that the case and buttons of the remote should be made of rubber , and the shape of buttons should be as simple as possible .
Marketing suggested that the fancy design on the remote control is important to customers according to his research , so the buttons could be shaped like fruit and vegetables , and the buttons could be made out of rubber rather than hard plastic .
User Interface believed that fancy buttons might create lots of trouble for people to use the remote . So , he suggested that there could be only one fancy button . For example , the stand by button could be shaped like an apple , and all the other buttons could only stay in normal shape .
Several technical matters are being resolved : a conversion program is being written for data to be translated between XML and the Java Embedded-Bayes notation ; the language generation templates are now available for the english version of the SmartKom system ; SmartKom now works on three different machines at ICSI . On the other hand , future collaboration on belief-nets has already been agreed with another research group . The construction analysis and formalism are also progressing . Several issues that have been dealt with were mentioned during the meeting : indefinite pronouns and wh-questions , noun-phrase structure , etc . This analysis is being done with the help of a linguist , who often provides different perspectives to methods and terminology .
For the SmartKom generation module , all the syntax-to-prosody rules are going to be re-written for English . Additionally , OGI can offer a range of synthesiser voices to choose from .
As the translation of the german SmartKom into English moves on , the generation rules may prove difficult to tackle for someone without experience in functional programming , as they are written in LISP .
The Bayes-net is going to be the focus of the presentation . In order to complete a functioning prototype of the belief-net , it was decided to start expanding the Ontology and Discourse nodes by working with a simple construction , like `` where is X ? '' . A robust analysis of such a basic utterance will indicate what the limits of the information derived from the construction are , as well as ways to design the whole module and fit other constructions in .
Additionally , in the example `` Where is X ? '' construction , the ambiguity ( Location or Path ) could be coded either in the semantics of the construction or as if determined by context . The former could mean creating a different construction for every slight pragmatic variation , and the latter , some of the belief-net probabilities could be instantiated in the lexicon .
The meeting was mainly about conceptual design . First , the marketing gave some opinions about product requirements based on market surveys and the group discussed some specific ways to fulfill them . After that , the user interface designer proposed to make a universal controller with speech recognition and a blinking thing . A list of basic components were also given . When it came to the cost control , the group believed that they should do some compromise to keep the cost under 12.5 Euros and the specific design scheme would be decided at the next meeting .
The marketing put forward three aspects in product requirements . Most importantly , the look and feel of the remote control should make it stand out from the rest products on the market . Second , it had to be technologically innovative so that people would be attracted to buy it . Third , it should be user-friendly . After that , the group discussed some specific ways to fulfill these requirements .
The marketing recommended bringing some elements of fruit and vegetables , bright colors , some eye-catching and bold design , and a spongy feel into the product . Inspired from cell phones , the marketing also proposed a changeable cover which could be customized by the user . Besides , the marketing disapproved of having LCD screens and speech recognition because he did n't think it would be worth extra expense and effort .
The project manager thought it was a good idea and the cover could go for three to five Euros . However , he wondered whether the superiors would be glad with it because it would introduce a completely new line of supplies .
The user interface designer wanted a universal controller with speech recognition to store channel information so that the users could just say out the name of a channel like BBC instead of remembering the exact number of it . Also , a blinking thing which could serve as the battery alarm and the indicator of the location of the controller was taken into account by the group . The user interface designer wanted the product to be children-friendly , which meant users could program it to prevent children from browsing certain channels . In terms of the product components , there would be an integrated circuit , some transistors , buttons , scroll wheels , infrared , LED , LCD , and an advanced chip .
The industrial designer worried that the function would make the product difficult to use , which was against the product requirement . Then the user interface designer thought it would depend on how much effort the user could put . Thus , the group decided to produce two versions - one giving the full freedom to the user , the other keeping some constraints .
The project manager wondered whether they could implement the design for twelve Euro and fifty cents . Then the industrial designer replied that the function of programming the keys was affordable while the feasibility of the ASR system was uncertain . Therefore , maybe they should make some compromise . Finally , the industrial designer and the user interface designer were required to provide two designs with the exact cost price at the next meeting so that they could see which one fit their budget better .
This is a kick-off meeting for a new remote control project for television sets . Project Manager started it with a review of project objectives and then the team got acquainted with each other and tools . Through discussion , the team decided to design a remote control with grouped buttons , useful with DVD players and carrying some special features to be confirmed .
Project Manager suggested designing a remote control useful for multiple devices such as TV and home stereo . Marketing disagreed by pointing out that TV was mostly used with VCR or DVD player or recorders , functions for which should be included , rather than with a stereo . Against this point , Project Manager argued that DVD players and home cinema sets usually doubled as stereo hi-fi sets . The discussion took a turn when the User interface disagreed and suggested designing a remote control only for televisions . Project Manager insisted on including other functions as most remote controls did and everyone was on board in the end .
User Interface disagreed on adding support for DVD players to the remote control as the email stated that it should be a television remote control .
Project Manager recommended to consider the practical value of adding support for DVD players to the remote control . If it was believed to be useful , then this idea would be adopted .
Project Manager suggested a can opener beneath the remote control , three players inside it , and different fronts on it . The rest of the team remained silent about the first idea and negative about the other two . Moreover , Industrial Designer pointed out that it needed to go with fashion ; and User Interface shared the idea of keeping it simple and using an international standard .
When discussing features to make the remote control trendy , User Interface recommended to keep the remote control simple in order to gain a whole market and to use a standard as it was aimed at an international market .
Marketing first of all suggested focusing on elderly people who really got problems with remote controls and then pointed out the unclear button allocation on remote controls . To solve this problem , Marketing put forward that the remote control buttons should be grouped based on functions they serve . Project Manager agreed .
The group discussed the current state of their work , which was coming close to a conclusion . They were putting together their final model , including the various techniques they had explored . Their performance on the Aurora tasks was second and very close to those in first place . The professor thought that further tweaking and incorporation of a neural network would improve their scores . The team discussed which method to use for noise suppression , which had not been decided yet . They also delved into a more detailed discussion of the VAD and latency . Their method for noise estimation would add a notable delay to the model . Finally , the team delved further into how to finish up the model .
The team had started putting together the various techniques they had developed into a single software . Their score was 53.6 and it was working on spectral subtraction and noise addition after cleaning up mel bins . The professor did not think much had changed .
PhD E explained that the best result was when FFT bins were applied with a Wiener filter and no noise was added . The results with noise addition were very close , but not as good .
The professor was happy to hear that the team had already started putting together a final software . The professor also noted that Finnish and Spanish had the smallest overall number compared to Aurora .
The team thought that the differences in performance between well-matched and high mismatch may have to do with the frame dropping problem . Tinkering around and changing a few small things was suggested as a way of improving performance . The team though it would also be nice to have the net on the server side where it would use less bandwidth . The team also discussed if averaging over the entire spectrum was a good idea .
PhD E thought that changing a few things could result in an improvement , but they had to be careful with the neural net . PhD also played around with noise estimation to improve the model but did not play around with it much .
The professor wanted to know how much the model improved due to frame dropping . He thought four or five changes would result in good improvements . The professor highlighted that improvements should not come at a higher bandwidth .
Project Manager briefed members on a new remote control project . By drawing favourite animals , the team got to know each other . Two complementary remote controls could be designed for a certain object , one having main functions and another with all the special things . And this device was just aimed for television , without video recorder functions on it .
Marketing was tired of too many buttons with different functions separately , but yet he doubted whether combining all different remotes together was necessary because he felt it ended up with multimedia overload . User Interface thought remote controls were pretty nice but could be a bit annoying because users did n't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel . However , three separate remote controls with too many buttons for TV could be confusing and complicated . Industrial Designer agreed with having too many remotes around .
Industrial Designer proposed that it 's important to use the remote control with ease . Buttons , in the proper size , should n't be too many to confuse . He thought users were supposed to know what they were doing . And he was particularly interested in not moving the control around to get it to work with the infra-red . Industrial Designer also proposed that the remote control to be designed should work for what it 's doing .
Have one remote that has the main functions such as turning on , turning off , channel changing , volume ; and another remote with all the special things .
Marketing thought they should design a remote control for television only due to the issue of advancement . User Interface supposed that it would be nice to have playing and recording and stop buttons on remote controls for the video recorder as well , but he did n't know if that worked technologically . Industrial Designer agreed to define the object of remote control , and he proposed that it would be simpler if it 's just for television because there were fewer buttons , which would benefit older people or people that were n't very co-ordinated hand-eye .

The meeting focused on the Aurora project . The Professor began with some updates on how certain decisions made by those leading the project did not make sense . There was some confusion and debate about how to move forward . The team then moved onto a discussion about measuring the effect of a given feature on the model . The professor outlined the specific methodology . At the time , the team was focused on testing for C-zero and C-one only , but they decided to expand their testing . Finally , the professor told some stories to explain future directions and the team had a brief discussion about their hardware .
The team had gotten a fifty percent improvement on the model . This was significant but left room for further work . They aimed to get a sixty percent improvement from the initial baseline .
The professor explained that Guenter Hirsch had left Ericsson and that Ericsson may withdraw from Aurora altogether . For the past two to three years , he was happily employed at a technical college not too far from Aachen .
PhD C thought the team was not far from fifty percent over the new baseline , which equated to sixty percent over the old baseline . Their model was around fifty to fifty five over the old baseline at the time . Though , the number would depend on the exact weightings .
The professor made his suggestions through stories . The Professor wanted to make a point about how they should run a set of experiments to measure the effect of different features with variance in mind . He explained that they should weight each coefficient by inverse of the variance .
The professor told the group a story about soldiers assigned to watch out for spy planes . The plane showed up at four each day and the soldiers called it in . Once the pattern was clear , they stopped looking for it and spent time with the locals instead . One day , the plane did not come but the soldiers still reported it , so they got into trouble . The professor used the story to make a point about making an assumption and then seeing if it holds after changing something small .
The professor told a story about how people could pretend to be working by consuming computer memory without doing anything useful . He recounted a story about a company that was paid by the U.S. government based on the amount of computer time they used . The company ran a useless program to rack up computer time .
Basically , the Children , Young People and Education Committee 's meeting was about the current situations and policies regarding schools , students and staff during the COVID-19 pandemic . Dealing with this pandemic was extremely challenging and the government had to make decisions quickly to ensure public safety . The main concern as the education Minister was to protect all staff and pupils in schools and other educational settings . Their belief was that no child shall miss out on any education , unless absolutely necessary . From next week , schools would have a new proposal which would help support those most in need , including people involved in the immediate response to the coronavirus outbreak . The key was that they were looking at supporting and safeguarding the vulnerable and ensuring continuity of learning , which included all of those who benefited from free school meals and children with additional learning needs . What they needed to do now was to do all the work together as they were facing the continuing challenges posed by the coronavirus .
According to Kirsty , they are actually in an unusual situation but they were trying to create a system where it would be seamless and it would not necessarily matter that two of those weeks were formally holidays . One particular group of children and young people that they hoped would be eligible to be included in the potentially vulnerable category was young carers . The basic principle they used was that even if it was a minority of children who went to those schools and were vulnerable , they deserved and needed the support through the school .
Kirsty admitted that they were now in a strange situation . What they were trying to work to was that they would have ongoing provision . Also , they were trying to create a system that would run uniformly . Such was a rapidly-evolving problem and the scale was something that they had not seen in 100 years . Therefore , they would have to evolve and iterate things as they went . Now they were worried about displacement activities . During the holidays , every head teacher would be in school on Monday with their staff .
Based on Kirsty 's words , this was a potential . The local authority had already chosen some locations and was already having communications with how they would then staff the centers . The local authorities were best placed to understand what was the best , pragmatic use of the resources that they had available , and of course those resources , primarily , were human beings . They wanted to give the parents confidence that , when they left their child with us , that child would receive something really worthwhile , and they could direct all of their attention to doing their job .
Already , local authorities were making different provisions . Even in special schools , there would be children whose parents would be key workers . Therefore , they would expect them to expect those sChools to apply the same principle . They would have to continue with the principle of keeping social distance and any provision for a child in a special school in a different setting would be unlikely , given the nature of the special school . Thus , they would look to cater for that within the original school .
Kirsty believed that it was a devastating decision to have been taken . But they had done so on the very clear and unambiguous advice from Qualifications Wales . They were dealing with a situation that requires human beings to be involved in it , and those human beings could find themselves unwell . Therefore , their best attempts would be to maintain the normal rhythm of an exam 's day in August , but that had to be caveated by the fact that they were dealing with difficult circumstances . With regard to AS-levels , no final decision has been made for exactly how those students would be treated . There were a range of options that could be used . With regard to other types of qualifications , the vast majority of BTECs was a modular continually-assessed piece of work , and they would have every expectation that BTECs would be able to be awarded .
According to Kirsty , all exams were cancelled , but year 11 and 13 would be given a grade . That was because those years and those grades were gateway qualifications , and they were points of movement in the education system . Therefore , it was really important for those students that they were not disadvantaged in any way by not being able to receive a grade that helps them to make a decision as a qualifying step into what they would do next . Actually , they could make sure that their standards were maintained by actually having that modulation across that UK . So , the children could have real confidence .
According to Kirsty , children might well have done lots of oral exams in their English and in their Welsh language . Therefore , they had lots of pieces of work that would have been externally verified . They certainly would ensure that these concerns were passed on . Their job was to make the decision on the examinations on the basis of having confidence that what could be put in places was fair and was equitable , and they had the confidence that they would be the case .
The answer was positive . The views of university and how university terms might be impacted was one of the ways and one of the reasons that they had factored in to making these decisions . The discussions with universities were ongoing . The conversations would continue as they work through the practicalities of how the gradings that were awarded were going to feed through into university admissions decisions and enrollment .
According to Kirsty , they had been very impressed with the maturity and forward-planning that had been adopted by all of those institutions and their representative bodies . They had got consistency in the approach and a common desire , and investment in moving towards online support for students . There was still a safety net idea . Colleges had indicated , as with schools , that , for the most vulnerable learners , they would have something in place that might permit attendance on an individual basis . Any Welsh Government support going to stay , whatever the circumstances were . They would do their best to ensure that there would be no disruption to EMA .
Kirsty believed that universities were autonomous institutions - a status that they guarded jealously and they would never want to question . Colleges were in a similar position , looking to do as much as they could to provide continuity of learning via distance learning methods , and the Bill , potentially , did give them more powers of intervention in both the FE and the HE sector .
Actually , they did not anticipate any change in the approach to students . Individual student circumstances could well change and their expectation would be that the Student Loans Company would respond to that . There would undoubtedly in some cases be really typical challenges to service delivery , simply because organizations could be losing staff because of illness or the need to self-isolate or because they were reacting to social-distancing messages from the Government . They instituted a monitoring process very early on in the onset of the disease , not least because a number of institutions had campuses and activities in China and other parts of south-east Asia . And so , as the disease had progressed , they had seen lessons being learned from the support for students who were in isolation coming from there to the UK .
In Huw 's opinion , there were lessons that would need to be taken on board . There were established quality assurance and enhancement procedures in institutions to enable the tutors and other supporters to make sure that that material meets their needs . The intention in all of these institutions was that they would complete their course of study . Therefore , they were confident that that system would be robust and would make sure that the students were getting a course of learning that met their needs .
According to Kirsty , this was a really worrying time for children and young people . For schools and institutions , they had the formal NHS counselling services to the check-ins . They were concerned that for some children , their access to their counselling was via their school . They knew that and they were just double checking the capacity of online counseling that already existed - online counselling tools that children already used because they did not want to go to the counsellor in the school and be seen in the school corridor going to the counsellor .
During a prolonged period of closure , they had to acknowledge was what they were looking at—they would expect school staff—well-being staff , for instance in school—to be doing check-ins—phone check-ins , potentially , or FaceTime check-ins , with students , just to keep in touch with them as we go forward . They would be looking to promote amongst young people a range of online facilities that were available—so , for instance , Meic website—so , looking to use a variety of platforms .
Because that routine of going into school and that normality was one that they had needed and wanted to maintain . They needed to understand , and Kirsty thought that they would also have to recognize , that this support would have to be ongoing once they were back to normal , and they would have to continue to look to support children in the longer term who would have lived through this experience . They were incredibly resilient , and they had been the champions of some of our public health messages . They were so much better and so much more compliant on the whole 'washing your hands ' and things like that than even adults have been .
According to Kirsty , no formal decision had been made . They were facing unprecedented circumstances . The normal rules had to change and , those organizations , they would need them to be providing youth services for children when they were back to normal , and they would n't want to do anything that would undermine their ability to do that . Their call to the youth service was a call to arms , though .
The group discussed the preparation of a data sample for IBM , the manual adjustment of time bins by transcribers , recognition results for a test set of digits data , and forced alignments . Participants also talked about Eurospeech 2001 submissions , and exchanged comments on the proceedings of the recently attended Human Language Technologies conference ( HLT'01 ) . Preliminary recognition results were presented for a subset of digits data . Efforts to deal with cross-talk and improve forced alignments for non-digits data were also discussed .
One meeting recording has been channelized and pre-segmented for delivery to IBM . A subset of Meeting Recorder data will be prepared ( i.e . pre-segmented and manually adjusted ) for delivery to IBM .
Preliminary recognition results were obtained for a subset of digits data . The error rate distribution was multimodal , reflecting differences in performance for native versus non-native speakers , and also possible pre-processing errors .
The Transcriber interface may require modifications if it becomes necessary for transcribers to quickly switch among waveform displays .
Transcribers risk overlooking speech that is deeply embedded in the mixed signal . Should transcriptions be derived from each of the close-talking channels or from the mixed signal alone ? The pre-segmentation tool does not perform well on short utterances , e.g . backchannels .
Deleting segments of the recordings is expected to be very time-consuming for transcribers . More results are needed for generating adequate submissions for Eurospeech'01 .
Future efforts will involve an attempt to get good forced alignments on digits data and generate a report for Eurospeech'01 .
The meeting between the Children , Young People and Education Committee and the Welsh Government was considered as a post-legislative scrutiny session on the Higher Education ( Wales ) Act 2015 . To start with , Kirsty Williams AM suggested although the Bill was taken forward by a different Minister in a different administration , it was still valuable to discuss in the current context . The Act had partly fulfilled the Government 's objectives in regulating institutions , safeguarding contribution , managing fair access and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy . Kirsty Williams AM also pointed out that new methods should be included to further regulate , co-ordinating and fund the sector . When it comes to the future of the Act , the meeting agreed that tertiary education providers should contribute to national goals and outcomes as part of the civic mission , and students ' interests must be fully preserved . Meanwhile , some participants argued that HEFCW 's powers were inflexible and fee plans from private providers were hard to regulate . Kirsty Williams AM agreed that a more flexible connection between the regulating sectors and the others should be attained . Besides , the meeting also talked about managing risk and agreed that the Act , in the future should include more alternative providers for students who were receiving long-term support . In the end , Kirsty Williams AM praised the contribution from overseas providers in supporting transnational education in Wales and agreed that rights of students in Wales should always be put in the first place .
Although highly challenged by the participants , Kirsty Williams AM argued that the Act had fulfilled the Government 's objectives in regulating institutions , safeguarding contribution , managing fair access and protecting the principle of institutional autonomy . These strategic aims were still really important but in the new situation , it was required to recognise the higher education and research Bill across the border in England . In this case , to continue fulfilling its national outcomes , the Act should evolve by implementing new student support measures .
The Act was considered that the legislation itself was not strong enough by Sian Gwenllian AM and Kirsty Williams AM agreed that remit letters were a really important way in which national priorities could be preserved . Moreover , it was stressed that it was important to make the distinction between the scale of private providers , and what could be termed as 'unregulated providers ' in the Welsh system . In this case , they should be designated on a case-by-case basis and always be able to protect the interests of the students . Besides , Kirsty Williams AM pointed out that the government had not identified an urgent reason to designate different types of courses as qualifying courses for the purposes of a fee limit , but in fact , the regulation for each type of them did differ from each other .
To answer this question , Kirsty Williams AM first introduced the achievements that the new system of student finance did again shift the parameters of influence that HEFCW or any new tertiary commission could have in the different situations , as a direct result of the changing scenario . Moreover , it was a great success to see all institutions sign up to becoming living wage employers , all institutions sign up to the Welsh Government 's code of ethical procurement .
Currently , the government planned to use the remit letter to drive transparency over senior leaders ' pay , the gender pay gap within institutions . For instance , it had been a success to use the remit letter and some funding to drive change and some improvements in mental health in the higher education sector . To conclude , Kirsty Williams AM suggested that the new PCET reforms were aimed to create a legislative regime and a regulation regime that encouraged collaboration and co-operation across the sector .
Dawn Bowden AM challenged that informal measures or actions had been taken in their role as regulator , and Kirsty Williams AM explained that the commission was expected to be able to have a series of abilities to intervene , from the soft , flexible type , which was non-punitive but actually allowed people to participate in it . Meanwhile , Huw Morris suggested that specific mechanisms and informal interactions with FE college principals , with the work-based learning provider network , etc had been used to hopefully achieve some alignment in the tertiary sector . Also , as a loan-based system of student finance , a system of block grant allocations and conditions could be attached to those grant allocations by HEFCW when things went wrong .
Huw Morris started by introducing the focus on learning from other nations to track the information flows and help the universities in return . Meanwhile , Kirsty Williams AM suggested a balance to be achieved by each part of the participants . However , Dawn Bowden AM questioned about HEFCW 's use of informal measures which might not be as prevalent as they currently are . Kirsty Williams AM answered that it should be remembered that HEFCW would surely be replaced , and a more flexible way would be adopted to control the financial codes of universities to assure the quality of the provision .
To answer Hefin David AM 's question , Kirsty Williams AM first stressed that the success of the fee and access plan relied on the understanding of whether an annual basis was an appropriate timescale for a university to be working to , and whether a long period was suitable for the Act . Sometimes it was hard to make a final judgment since the futures of the students were unpredictable but the fee and access plans could always be one of the drivers for some of the improvements . In the meantime , constant efforts had been put into communications with a range of stakeholders to continue developing legislative proposals to assure the fee .
Hefin David AM questioned about the right balance between institutions with the strongest track records that were more highly regulated and those riskier private alternative providers . Kirsty Williams AM argued that more attention should be paid to focus on the inherent quality of those charitable status which was regarded as a key reference point in the operation . Although there were some concerns of some private providers , particularly in England , they should not be treated the same . In this case , the government would regulate them on a course-by-course basis . Moreover , quality provision should be included and alternative providers would be given more attention .
Kirsty Williams AM first admitted that it was true that the Bill did not directly address issues around governance in the sector . However , establishing a more direct relationship with chairs of universities , especially one-to-one relationships with them , had been attached much importance and it was crucial to help the government understand each aspect of issues in universities . Moreover , ways to make sure that the governing bodies were diverse and it was able to include both student voice as well as the staff voice in governance going forward would be discussed in the future . Kirsty Williams AM stressed that there were plans to engage with each of the governing bodies since the situation was getting far more complex .
Sian Gwenllian AM argued that there was evidence regarding the difficulties caused by HEFCW having a legal duty to quality-assure all the provisions in two further education colleges . This process was regarded as an anomaly or an unintended consequence of the Act . Sian Gwenllian AM wanted Kirsty Williams AM to explain the situation in that instance and further methods to assure governing qualities .
Kirsty Williams AM first explained that it was a bit difficult to put herself in the position of the former Minister but it was clear that it should not be intended . However , she explained that the Act was built on what were the quality assessment arrangements in the 1992 Act , which required HEFCW to secure arrangements for the assessment of the quality of education provided by funding institutions . So , as a consequence of that approach , HEFCW 's quality assessment duty currently encompassesed all the education provided by or on behalf of a regulated institution . Huw Morris also helped to explain that a lot of joint operation was required during the process and the new Bill would try to make that clearer .
Kirsty Williams AM shared that the government had listened to stakeholders ' concerns regarding proposals to introduce a single quality assessment body . And she stressed that the principles underlying any assurance regime would need to be coherent , effective and comprehensive . Besides , the quality framework should cover higher education to make it compatible with ENQA , which was considered as highly important going forward , since it would be compatible with current UK-wide baseline standards to avoid specific problems for the HE sector in Wales . Although it might cause a stir , a change must be made in the new situation . Huw Morris also suggested that greater synergy would be encouraged in the ways in which quality assurance and enhancement was undertaken in different areas of activity .
The meeting was the fifth meeting of the House of Commons Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic . First of all , petitioners presented several petitions concerning BillC-7 , Senate Bill S-204 and virtual format of the Covid-19 committee . Later , the meeting questioned the ministry on the pressing issues faced by the business sector in Canada and the governments ' approaches towards the bad impact caused by Covid-19 . The government in return , introduced the pressing facts and assured the committee that a great number of actions had been taken into reality . Moreover , the meeting also discussed the rent assistance and ways to ensure the privileges of both the land owner and the farmers . When it comes to the international affairs , the ministry restated the importance of One China agreement and said that the border issues were taken a close look by the government . In the end , the ministry was challenged with the exact figures of the current situation in Canada .
Mr. Taylor Bachrach introduced that municipalities were unable to run deficits and so they were facing the reality of cutbacks and serious cuts to the services that Canadians depend on . Currently , The Federation of Canadian Municipalities and mayors across Canada have called for emergency financial relief for the municipal sector . Since they were very vital to the recovery of the cities under the Covid-19 situation , the government was working with the provinces and the cities , to ensure that it was able to support this order of government that could deliver the vast majority of services to Canadians with very little financial means .
The Prime Minister was challenged that a bus driver in Vancouver who had been laid off as a public sector worker , could not access the federal wage subsidy while the opposite result happened to another worker in the airline industry . The Prime Minister explained that the airline industry , like banking , like telecommunications , was a federal area of jurisdiction which could receive the promote wage subsidy . However , under the current situation , the federal government was working hard to ensure equal distribution of the whole nation .
Hon . Catherine McKenna restated the answer several times that under the Covid-19 situation , although the government was trying hard to cope with different issues while handling the projects at the same time , things took time to finish the process . Moreover , Hon . Catherine McKenna assured the committee that the government was taking every method of solving the problem . However , this answer was challenged by Mr. Luc Berthold who insisted the ministry had not given an exact number .
The Minister of Foreign Affairs suggested the importance of One China agreement but also expressed great gratitudes towards all the donors across the world . The cooperation between every area in the world was welcomed and it would be glad to see global efforts to battle the Covid-19 virus .
Hon . Patty Hajdu ( Minister of Health ) introduced that the government had been very committed to improving access and affordability for prescription medications for all Canadians . The PMPRB regulatory amendments would help Canadians be able to afford their prescriptions , and Canada would continue to be an important market for new medicines . However , it was challenged that seniors were being particularly hard hit right now during this pandemic , yet seniors had not been given any direct support . As a promise , the government assured the committee that appropriate attention had been paid to the senior patients .
Hon . Patty Hajdu introduced that contact tracing was an important part of managing any outbreak . In fact , the government had been looking at a number of ways to support increased contact tracing across the country , including working with provinces and territories to boost their capacity through human resources and volunteer organizations . However , it was challenged that the Privacy Commissioner had suggested if there was also a crisis of confidence . And it was assured that particular attention must be paid to transparency , privacy and ethical concerns to ensure privacy .
It was believed that the farm sector would be taking the Prime Minister up on the suggestion that $ 250 million should be seen as an initial investment . On the financial safety net that the government had in place for the farmers , called the business risk management program , which was announced up to $ 125 million in funding through AgriRecovery and made changes to AgriStability that would help producers quickly .
It would be carried out soon and the relief package would include funding for airline ticket refunds similar to what other countries around the world had done . The announcement was made recently by Air Canada . It would start shortly and would apply to all places and destinations where Air Canada flew .
As a fact , 98 % of all the businesses in this country were small businesses , so they absolutely contributed enormously to the communities and were job creators . That was why the government had put out significant measures . For the Canada emergency business account , over 550,000 small businesses have been approved and were getting that support .
Currently , there were two issues regarding the 50 % commercial rent assistance subsidy , where landlords paid 25 % , the government paid 50 % , and the tenant was responsible for 25 % . The government had been working with the provinces and territories to provide this forgivable loan to commercial property owners , who in turn would lower the rent of their tenants by 75 % . The government would continue to monitor how this program was delivered .
On April 17 , the Minister of Canadian Heritage announced funding of $ 500 million to assist Canada 's arts , sports and cultural sectors . Hon . Steven Guilbeault ( Minister of Canadian Heritage ) suggested that the department would be releasing the details of that announcement , and how the money was going to be spent in the coming days .
It was suggested that farmers and relative products were largely influenced by Covid-19 . Hon . Marie-Claude Bibeau introduced that the government had already confirmed various supports for the agricultural sector . This week , the government focused on beef and pork producers and processors , as well as sectors with product surpluses that could be redirected to food banks . At the same time , industry and suppliers had enthusiastically answered the call to equip Canada with products and goods during the crisis .
The participants discussed how meetings would be transcribed , what kind of information to include in their corpus as well as how to structure it , issues with storing data , and their model . They were particularly concerned with how IBM could assist with transcribing meetings and how they would manage large amounts of data if they include more information in their corpus , given that they were running low on storage . They decided that they could store the data on tapes for backup , and that they would wait and see how IBM transcribes their meetings . As for the modeling , PhD I reported several results and a few members of the team decided to further discuss progress in a smaller meeting later on .
The discussion centered on the extent to which the recordings should be segmented for the corpus and which recordings should be included in the corpus . The team expressed that it would be helpful to filter out breath and non-verbal sounds . It also expressed that for two person conversations and transcripts that do not follow their general meeting setup , it could create a different directory .
The team felt that the current file system they were using was running out of space , specifically back-up capacity . They needed to figure out a way to back-up the data they were collecting . They decided that the tape system that ICSI has is pretty reliable . But they needed to discuss the matter with the system administrator .
The participants were skeptical that a two person conversation in the hallway constituted a meeting for their purposes . They thought that it would be okay to include this kind of data in their corpus for future researchers , but they should separate it . The Professor has a strong opinion that these interactions were not actually meetings .
PhD I thought that the team should re-evaluate recognition without cheating on the segmentation . PhD I explained to the team that they had so far been using a simplified version of the scoring and brought up that Thilo wanted to use recognizer alignments to train his speech detector . He was not sure how much hand labeling would be needed to generate data for the detector .
The professor expressed that the team should not recycle backed up disk space and explained the rate at which they could acquire disks . He was surprised that burned CD 's wear out after a year or two . He thought that putting the data on tape was a good idea .
PhD I suggested putting the data on a CD-ROM but was informed that the data gets lost in a few years . PhD F expressed that it was generally a bad idea to have a copy on a medium that failed . Professionally pressed discs last longer , but they would be burning them in-house . The idea of re-burning the CD 's each year was also not adopted .
Industrial Designer and User Interface presented a prototype of the new remote control according to the team 's previous meetings . However , due to the budget limit , the team had to give up the spongy rubber material and the double-curved design . Instead , the remote control would be made of plastic and have only one curve . There would not be any location function , either . The team decided to make the remote control conspicuous by designing a bright yellow banana shape in case it got lost easily in a room . In the product evaluation , the team was satisfied with its success in reducing the number of unused buttons . The user interface was considered to be user-friendly enough . However , the team also admitted that there was still room for improvement on the location function , technological innovation , the material , as well as the fashion style of the remote control . At the end of the meeting , all team members expressed themselves about the teamwork sincerely .
The use of the LCD screen and the advanced chip cost the team half of the expenditure . Due to the budget limit , the team had to abandon some other designs such as the rubber material and the double-curved structure . The USB connection was not feasible for now as well . For the location function , a transmitter , a receiver and speakers could be incorporated on a TV instead .
In the budget balancing , User Interface desired an articulation , which would , however , lead the remote control to be double-curved . Initially , Project Manager was not sure about this , for the double-curved design would go over the budget . Industrial Designer pointed out that a single curve would still allow the articulation . The remote control could be made in two parts and joined together with the articulation . Project Manager accepted Industrial Designer 's proposal .
User Interface told the team that the corporate had decided to incorporate a voice recognition chip into the remote control so that the team had to invent another method for users to locate the remote control once it got lost in a room . The team decided to make the remote control a special colour . Meanwhile , the remote control would be able to camouflage in the living room . Project Manager further proposed that the team could also make the remote control glow in the dark .
In the product evaluation , the team was satisfied with its success in reducing the number of unused buttons . The user interface was considered to be user-friendly enough . However , the team also admitted that there was still room for improvement on the location function , technological innovation , the material , as well as the fashion style of the remote control .
The team had decided to replace the rubber with plastic due to the budget limit . When evaluating the material of the remote control , Marketing admitted that sponginess was what most users desired , which was the feel given by rubber . Project Manager agreed . However , Project Manager pointed out that a plastic remote control was no worse than other remote controls in the market , so it would not be a step-back at least .
Marketing concluded from the market research that users expected the remote control to combine fruit and vegetable elements with its fashion design . User Interface disagreed with Marketing , for it was believed by User Interface that fruit and vegetable style was not the sole criterion for satisfactory fashion design of the remote control . Instead , User Interface implicated that all designs inspired by current fashions were likely to win the users over .
The meeting occurred very close to the finalization of the Aurora model . The team discussed how various components of the model could be moved around to improve results . They had to decrease system latency as well to meet the Aurora requirements . The team thought that LPC could solve the problems they were having . The team also began discussing the Wall Street Journal data and task , which focused on speech recognition . The team was studying the task and learning from Mississippi State 's existing model on how to perform better on it . Finally , the team discussed how they could histogram equalization as an alternative to some of the techniques they were using in their current models .
The team was filtering out white noise from the digit task using LPC . The concern was that LPC was not a great representation of speech . The LPC was adding degradation .
The professor thought the LPC had two problems . It was adding degradation and there was an issue with pitch . The professor also expressed that the LPC was throwing away information that was useful .
PhD D expressed that the resynthesized version of the speech that LPC gave was not the same as speech . Though , the excitations were more clear in the resynthesized version .
Guenter from Germany expressed that CVS would not work for him . He was going to work on histogram equalization . Histogram equalization was mentioned in a recent paper published by Ney . The team discussed the paper and its implications .
PhD D had not read the paper , only the poster on histogram equalization . PhD D reported that the histogram equalization was similar to on-line normalization . There was a histogram for each frequency band .
PhD A wanted to know what exactly the technique did . PhD A inquired into how the histogram may represent energy levels and how histograms could speak to what can be done with the model .
This was the final meeting of detailed design . To start with , Project Manager introduced the planned scheme of the meeting , followed by User Interface and Industrial Designer indicating the possible changes into an LCD screen and a jog-dial . After that , the group continued to talk about the slogan , the button size , and the button color . However , considering the budget , they consistently abandoned some of the designs . These included kinetic power , rubber material , LCD panel , advanced chip , and special colored buttons . Marketing moved the discussion to evaluate the current design through collectively rating from one to seven . The final part was the project evaluation , including the system , leadership , teamwork , and tools given .
User Interface indicated to have a simple LCD screen to cut down the budget , while Industrial Designer suggested the application of a little more complex LCD panel , like the number pad , could display the advanced functions possibly used by the users . Marketing and Project Manager agreed with Industrial Designer . Next , the group turned to discuss some details , like the total size for the button , and the various functions of the button as well as a jog-dial .
The button was red with a width of three centimeters and a half . As for the function , it could be used as a confirm button for the LCD screen and a power button if the user held it for around two seconds .
The jog dial can be used to control volume , contrast , brightness , channels , auxiliary inputs , color , sharpness , sound , audio , left-right balance , and pre-programmed sound modes .
Project Manager wanted the members to evaluate the whole process of the project , such as the system , leadership , teamwork , and tools given . The meeting system was considered creative yet inefficient as the early designs were found generally out of budget . As for leadership , the process was a bit too structured . As for teamwork , additional communications like the quick talk could further prompt the current system . Besides , the tools given were criticized for the isolation of each 's tasks and thoughts .
Marketing thought Project Manager 's system was fairly institutional with a central point of creativity , but the group ought to focus more on the stylish look and technology and make a proper consideration on the budget .
Industrial Designer thought the meeting was not friendly to the brainstorming . The restriction was not about the atmosphere but related to the actual environment and the limited time for discussion . Besides , the interaction was structured , meaning each individual took charge of one particular task without enough collaboration between each other . Also , communication through email was inefficient .
The whole meeting was focused on the conceptual design of the new remote control product . After Project Manager briefly reaffirmed the agreements reached in previous meetings , Marketing , User Interface , and Industrial Designer each gave a presentation about trend-watching , interface design , and components design respectively . Then , Project Manager started a group discussion about important points just covered , including energy source , voice recognition , LCD screen , as well as case design , on which more emphasis was paid in the last half of the meeting . Finally , the group roughly drew out a specific case design .
For one thing , Marketing argued that target customers as the elder generation tended not to shake their remote controls before using . For another , he believed that the docking station was in a position to load up the batteries , therefore , the basic normal battery would be sufficient for the charging need , which was confirmed by User Interface who pointed out that remote control with a minor display would in no way be power-consuming .
Marketing first brought up price concern , implying that voice recognition could significantly drive up cost and price . Also , Marketing argued that unlike the LCD screen , the elderly would not fancy speech recognition because it would not make the remote control more user-friendly . Project Manager applauded Marketing 's opinion and agreed that the LCD screen should be given priority over voice recognition .
Firstly , the group reached a consensus that material should be plastic with wooden colour as opposed to wood . Then , User Interface brought forward a changeable case as a solution and was unanimously accepted . After that , the group discussed the shape of the control and chose single-curved for the time being . Finally , they drew out a specific case design and roughly determined the position of each button while taking the convenience of left-handed users into account .
As Marketing explained , a single remote control would be designed to fit into an original wooden cover as well as a standard plastic one , in order to meet the differentiated needs of the customers . As a result , besides remote control , two types of cases would also be sold as extra products .
Firstly , despite the convenience of left-handed users , symmetrical button design would create extra buttons and hence inevitably confuse users . Also , Project Manager pointed out that left-handed users have no difficulty handling the remote control by either side of hands . User Interface added that a thumb was sufficient for this motion , so no difference should exist between left and right .
The meeting focused on the cost and design implication of including the wheel , the best way to include the light , ensuring that buttons are well-placed , and choosing a fashionable fruit as the remote 's design . Project Manager reiterated that several decisions , like not having an LCD , having a wheel , and including a lighting feature , have been made in the previous meeting . Then , Industrial Designer highlighted that the wheel was expensive , though , likely still within the budget . User Interface led some discussion about placing the buttons in a way that minimizes strain for the user . Finally , Marketing informed the group that fruits and vegetables were the upcoming fashion trend . The group decided that a banana would be a good option for the design and discussed how existing priorities could be adapted to a curved design .
Industrial Designer informed the team that the standard wheel is fifty times more expensive than a push button , so it might be hard to incorporate it into the design . Project Manager was insistent that the wheel is included , however . Then , the team discussed whether to include a motion activated light or continuous light .
Industrial Designer thought that the wheel would be too expensive , especially considering that the remote casing would be costly . In Industrial Designer 's opinion , the backlight on the push buttons added enough novelty that the wheel would not be necessary . Industrial Design thought that having a motion activated backlight would be useful , as opposed to a continuous one . The motion sensor was not too expensive , so it would n't be a costly addition .
User Interface was concerned with voice activation and the light . The manufacturing division of the company already had a voice chip that they could adopt . User Interface thought that the light should be continuous since that would make the remote easier to find and that the cost of the motion sensor could be higher than expected .
Marketing introduced market research that suggested the best remote design would be spongy and take the form of a fruit or vegetable . The initial contenders for the remote shape were banana , apple , and pear . Banana won because of its colour and easily identifiable shape .
Marketing believed that the trend of fruits and vegetables that fashion watchers have detected in Milan and Paris is a good indication of what kind of style the remote should have . It could make for a fancy and technologically innovative device . Marketing thought that the pear would make a good shape because it 's easy to hold and that the remote should be spongy .
Project Manager supported spongy material because of its robust quality and wanted to prioritize the wheel since it differentiated their remote from competitors . Project Manager also thought that the banana would be a good choice since it will be easy to find .
The meeting was about various approaches that the team could pursue for further research . The team initially discussed the delay between the frequency bands which was causing problems in the model deployment . They then discussed how spectral subtraction could help various tasks . The meeting ended with more ideas on improving the model , like directionality of voice and looking at smaller units of sound in recordings .
The team was looking at existing models and thinking about the various bugs that they had to deal with . The frequency differences in the FIR filters was one . Another thing they wanted to look into was handling additive noise , which they had not dealt with explicitly .
The team thought that around 250 milliseconds was a good heuristic to detect the end of the utterance . The utterance recognition also had some processing time attached , increasing the delay .
The professor said that people adamantly insist on going in with a brain damaged system , overlooking straight forward solutions . He thought that the lag should not be too long for the task .
The team discussed how sonorance detection could constitute a low-level feature that their models detected . In one of the models , low level detectors are looking for specific sonorance features which are more robust than typical full-band Gaussian mixtures .
The professor told the group that the current neural network had a sigmoid with a weighted sum as a low level detector . It trained using gradient descent . He suggested they delve into this further on Friday .
Grad E started the discussion on sonorance and informed the team of the model by Saul , Allen , and Rahim . The model detects phonetic features using independent tests . He explained that several detectors trained on different features were more robust than a full-band of Gaussian mixtures .
This was the conceptual design meeting for the remote . The first presentation was given by Marketing on trend watching . Marketing pointed out that customers wanted the remote to be technologically innovative and yet simple to use , and that the current fashion trend was fruits and vegetable patterns . Clearly labelled large buttons with the company logo and colour scheme were also preferred . User Interface followed with the presentation on interface concepts , proposing to have a scroll-down design and a distinctly recognizable demographic for specific buttons . Industrial Designer 's presentation on component design provided information for the material needed for the remote , and certain restrictions coming with different options . After User Interface 's additional thoughts on voice recognition , the team discussed designs of the energy source , the material , and the user interface concept , deciding on latex covers , the gun-metal grey colour , and blue and yellow touch buttons .
User Interface pointed out that if the remote was small , it would not go well with a base . The team then decided on a single smaller remote instead of a bigger one with a base , and a locating device would sufficiently prevent the remote from being lost . In terms of the battery , Industrial Designer suggested one small lithium battery instead of double A 's or triple A 's . An initial lithium battery could be sold with the remote , while subsequent replacements would be bought separately . With this suggestion in mind , the team decided to come back to it in the next meeting .
It was first suggested by User Interface that a charging base would not go well with a small remote . The team agreed on this , and Project Manager reminded them the remote was not going to be a huge one . User Interface worried that a small remote without a base could be more easily lost , but Marketing reassured the team that this would n't be a problem if the remote had a locating device . Each team member then gave his/her opinion on the issue , all preferring a smaller remote without a base .
When first suggesting one small lithium battery for the remote , Industrial Designer pointed out its wide availability and proved success in various electronic products . Project Manager had concerns on it being more expensive , but Industrial Designer said the final cost could be levelled down by its longer battery life . The bulk price for lithium batteries would also be fairly cheap . As for how to realize this design in the sales , Industrial Designer suggested providing one initial lithium battery along with the remote , while replacements would be sold separately .
Project Manager liked the phone dial shape with their logo in the middle , but User Interface thought the remote would be too wide or the buttons too small . Despite Industrial Designer 's proposal for scrolls , the team decided on buttons on the side instead . For their logo , Project Manager suggested putting it on a major button , but User Interface objected that it would wear off . They finally decided on leaving a space on the latex cover for the logo to be always visible . As for the colour for buttons , their decision was blue-based touch buttons with a yellow illumination .
Project Manager suggested having a large version of the company 's logo in the middle of the remote . User Interface pointed out that this design would make the remote too big and wide to fit into one hand . Furthermore , a large logo would take up so much space that the buttons would have to be smaller , and thus they would be less discernible . Project Manager acknowledged that User Interface 's argument was reasonable . User Interface then proposed an alternative design , curving the remote like a hand with scroll buttons on the side .
For the logo to remain despite latex cover changes , Project Manager proposed to print it on a button . Yet User Interface opposed this idea for fear that the print would wear off . Industrial Designer suggested putting the logo on the back of the remote , but this option was ruled out since the logo must be always visible . User Interface presented another option where the remote would consist of two pieces , but this too was incompatible with the cover design . Finally , Industrial Designer suggested leaving a cut-out space on latex covers to show the logo , and all agreed on this design .
Postdoc C suggested a possible hypothesis that energy is increased as more people are speaking . New forms were discussed , as these will include more details that may have to be completed by analysts through interviews with participants . The Multitrans update by the graduate student seems promising , and has been sent for review .
Derivatives were not discussed with Jose but other possibilities were explored . First that log energy is basically compressing the distances . Another is that he needs to assess the different temporal sizes . He is taking everything over two hundred milliseconds and varying that number . He is also considering moving windows , as previously discussed . He is measuring at the frame level .
Professor C said the basic hypothesis and starting point is if you examine the energy when two people are speaking at the same time , usually { there 'll be more energy than when one is . Coming up with a measure which will match this intuition is the next step . These energy features should be fed into a discriminative system . It is important to pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature .
For the new forms , one is a one time only speaker form and the other is the digits . The reason the time is included above the date is so that the person who 's extracting the digits will know where to look in the meeting , to try to find them . In addition to Name , Time and Email which the participant fills out , the form including seat number , session , native language , region of origin , time spent in an English speaking country , and accent characterization filled by research facilitators , after conducting a short interview .
Project Manager introduced a new remote control project for television sets , and the team got acquainted with each other and technical devices . The remote control would be priced at 25 Euros and a production cost of 12.5 Euros . Priority will be given to standard features , such as sorting through channels , instead of more advanced internet features .
User Interface and Industrial designer expressed a desire to integrate cutting-edge features into the remote . Marketing pointed out that most of the market will buy it for standard use , like changing channels and adjusting volume , so those features should be the priority . Project Manager agreed , explaining that people expect a well-functioning , normal remote for their proposed product price of 25 Euros .
Marketing believed that fancy features like IP would not be used by most people . The overwhelming majority of users would want convenient channel browsing and volume adjustment features . Those should remain the main focus instead of more novel features .
User Interface initially suggested that the remote control could also incorporate forward-looking features , like controlling personal video recorders . UI quickly jumped on board with focusing on regular features , however .
The remote control would be priced at 25 Euros , produced at a maximum cost of 12.5 Euros , and primarily marketed in Europe and North America . At least 4 million units would have to be sold to meet the company 's profit goals .
Project manager introduced the financial information : 25 Euro selling price and 12.5 Euro production cost . PM then went on to elaborate that the target market would primarily consist of Europe and North America . PM expressed that a profit aim of 50 million Euros , which could be achieved by selling 4 million of these remotes , was achievable .
User Interface reiterated that the company would have to sell four million units to make a profit .
After Project Manager first went over the previous meeting and summarized the meeting agenda , Inudstrial Designer started the prototype presentation of the remote control . The remote control should be curved with scroll and push buttons , made by smooth plastic or spongy rubber . Marketing presented the evaluation criteria of the remote control in terms of the user requirements and the trends . The remote control shall be fancy because it was heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality . Finally , they confirmed the components they planned to use under the restrict of finance .
User Interface first summarized the propotype of the remote control discussed before . The remote control should be curved , easy to hold , nice and small with big buttons . Those buttons were a scroll and some push buttons . The body of the remote control shall be smooth plastic or spongy rubber with yellow and black buttons . The remote control would be comfortable to watch because it had suitable curtature and it 's on-off was in the back .
User Interface tried to envisioned the remote control in well molded and hard smooth plastic . User Interface also suggested another possibility , which was a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . Which option to choose would depend on cost restraints .
They argued that the arrangement of the keys looked like a logo , a compass point , or texting . The simple but different design could be a good feature of the remote control , and made it pop up in common remote controls .
The group made an interactive evaluation of the remote control in terms of the user requirements and the trends . They mainly focused on the evaluation of price , fancy , color and energy . They picked another word , elegant , other than fancy to describe to design of the new remote control . The group failed to make a choice between the shape of banana and chunk , but they reached a consensus to use kinetic as the source of energy .
The remote control was quite fancy in the respect of appearance . The group picked the word elegant from aesthetic , trendy , elegant and stylish when User Interface suggested using a different word to describe the remote control . Still , they all agreed that fancy was more appropriate than elegant .
Industrial Designer thought the remote control would be cheap to develop because they did n't use any expensive components . But User Interface argued that it would cost a lot to find someone with good technology of programming and develop the innovative user interface .
This is the last meeting of the design group . At first , Industrial Designer introduced the remote control prototype to the group . It included buttons for channel change , power , menu and also had a slider for volume , an infra-red section and a microphone . The cover was interchangeable with a company logo on it . It was also made of a rubbery material and could stretch over . Then Project Manager went through the costs of various aspects of design and argued that a slight compromise could be made as the remote control would be a fashion accessory and have interchangeable covers . After that , Marketing specifically summed up the evaluation criteria of remote control . Finally , Project Manager concluded and praised the teamwork results .
Industrial Designer introduced the prototype to the team . It included buttons for channel change , power , menu and also had a slider for the volume , an infra-red section and a microphone . The cover was interchangeable with a company logo on it . User Interface added that the holes for the buttons to come through would be plastic , while the cover would be made of rubber . The final product would stand up and could stretch over .
User Interface proposed that the cover should be made of rubber and could stretch over . Project Manager agreed but asked Industrial Designer to broaden it out .
The remote control would be moulded to the shape of the hand when people held it . On the left there was a slider for the volume , and on the right there were several buttons . The power key would be the biggest so that people knew how to turn on the television . There would also be a microphone for all the voice commands .
Marketing believed that the remote control should be : fashionable ; technologically innovative ; easy to use ; suitable for the customer ; not complicated ; functional ; not inclined to cause RSI . Project Manager agreed and added that it should not take long to learn to use .
Project Manager thought it would attract older people who could n't manage the buttons as they would probably prefer speech recognition . However , Industrial Designer believed it tended to appeal more to younger aged groups as the team had gone with the fashion focus but then proposed that it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody .
Industrial Designer agreed that the remote control should be fashionable , technologically innovative and suitable for customers and proposed that fewer buttons could make the handle more ergonomically correct .
This meeting included three presentations from marketing , user interface and industrial design and discussion about core function of remote control . At first , marketing introduced the conclusion of experiment and questionnaire . Users thought remote controls were ugly and only used a few buttons . Since young users might prefer high technology features like speech recognition . After that , the user interface introduced how electric circuits , keyboard and transmitter reacted together . And group members discussed solutions of wave interference . Then industrial designer talked about working design and how LCD display or speech recognition might influence the design of circuits . And whether adding these functions would make the price out of range was discussed . After discussing new requirements for remote control from management , the group members started with core and basic functions , such as necessary buttons . Finally , they mentioned something about speech recognition and speech commands and their influence on battery life .
Marketing had concluded that younger users might be more expected to use high technology features such as LCD display and speech recognition . However , the industrial designer was worried it would influence the design of circuits and make the price out of range , while marketing thought they could afford it . Industrial designer also mentioned that they should care about battery life if speech recognition was used .
User interface said that they could make this wave in specific frequency to avoid interfering with other devices . A password could also be put inside the wave in case that two neighbours had the same remote controls . If two devices were trying to go to communicate with the TV set , then the wave with more energy was chosen .
Industrial designer thought that if they only used LCD displays , backlight radio frequency communication with the TV set and other related things , the price would be ok . However , if speech recognition was required , the price would be out of range . And he preferred IR circuits because it was much cheaper .
They wanted the number of buttons to be as small as possible and only stuck on useful functions . They thought that channel changing and volume setting button was obviously needed . There could also be key buttons which were used to select a specific channel . An individual power button was also considered necessary after discussion . But the user interface rejected having a TV setting button on the remote control .
The marketing hoped there would be some features on the control to display the name . Industrial designer also wondered about whether the time setting for turning on TV was useful . While the project manager thought that if time was added , a bigger display would be required , which was not useful for users .
Users did n't like the look and feel of most remote controls currently on the market . And most users only used ten percent of buttons on the remote control . Channel selection button was the most commonly used button , followed by the volume button . Young users might prefer to have high technology features such as LCD display or speech recognition function on the remote control .
New requirement included avoiding the teletext , focusing on remote control only for TV and keeping the product recognizable . All the group members agreed . They also decided to start with basic functions and then move on to the more advanced feature . Then they concluded that LCD display , channel button and volume button were necessary .
In the development of the project , this meeting was at the basis where a prototype of the product had been designed and it mainly focused on discussion about the cost and pricing of the product based on the material it used and the profit they wanted to obtain through this product . It turned out that the cost was very reasonable and the price was also very attractive . Then , the team evaluated the product by scoring according to criteria based on the user 's requirements and marketing trends . The meeting went very well and every team member agreed with each other on the evaluation results , which was promising to lead a success in this project .
This was a product shaped like a banana , with a standard battery and a wheel . The materials to manufacture this product included a yellow banana shaped case and a rubber . All of these summed up to cost 10.7 Euros , which was within their budget . And they had a price gap of 12.5 Euros , so they set the price at 25 Euros , which was very reasonable and attractive .
User Interface mentioned the banana-shaped wireless phone that sold a hundred Euros and more , which was very high . Compared with this , the price of their product was very attractive for the customers which was just 25 Euros . Customers would be very willing to buy it .
At the technological aspect , Industrial Designer thought the complexity of the phone was higher than the remote control , the price of these two can not compare though they looked alike .
Every team member evaluated the prototype , and the evaluation criteria were user-oriented and market-indicated , which meant the product needed to meet the following standard such as fancy appearance , innovative technology , easy using , fashion in trend , being highly visible in a room , and robust quality . The marketing set up seven points in each criterion and let the team members to score the product from one to seven . It turned out every criterion of this prototype scored high , the evaluation results were quite satisfying .
For the technologically innovative part , the product was only added with a wheel and the rubber material . In terms of innovation , there still lacked some shining points . Therefore , everyone gave a lower grade compared to other aspects .
Since this product did n't have much complex design , it was designed to be easy to use with a very simple structure . Hence , they all agreed that it was easy to use . As for the fancy part , the product was a banana shape , the fruit design was very up to date and fashionable . For the same reason that it resembled a banana , users would find it easily when they needed to use the remote control . What 's more , it had lightning , making it more visible in daily life . The product was surrounded by rubber , enabling it under protection , so the robust feature can be ensured .
This meeting is mainly about three presentations from three team members . First , it was Industrial Designer 's presentation on the working design of the remote control ; then , User Interface introduced the layout design of the remote control ; and at last , Marketing made a report on the user experience survey and potential user-friendly functionalities . At the same time , various discussions among team members went on concerning their presentations , on the industrial design , user interface , appearance and functionality of the remote control .
Industrial Designer considered batteries as the energy source . Marketing thinks that changing batteries all the time could possibly be annoying , so she suggests other energy options like solar charging . But Industrial Designer refutes this problem because people change batteries simply every six months . User Interface raised the question on the operational distance of the infra-red signal and hoped that the remote control could be equipped with a strong signal stream . But Project Manager rendered it unnecessary because TV is always put in a short distance . Later the team discussed the necessity of through-wall signal and Bluetooth , and decided that this idea remained an idea for some budget reasons and the lack of necessity .
In the presentation from User Interface , he first made sure of the position of the team ’ s remote control —— a remote control with basic functionalities and with some improvements . The must-haves would include volume control , channel keys up-down , a numerical keypad , a mute button and would exclude the lock button which was discussed in the precedent meeting . He made an introduction of two types of remotes : engineering centred ones which provide a lot of functionality and user centred which focus on the easiness of use . Later , the team discussed the locking function which Project Manager expected greatly , and also on the integration of the corporate image into the design of the remote control . At last , regarding the layout of the remote control , User Interface would like to make some improvements over two buttons concerning the ergonomic design .
User Interface said the locking function is a novel idea and a good inspiration . He had never seen a locking functionality . But User Interface thought that the locking function might be unnecessary , while Project Manager thought it probably should be easy to be realized in a physical form like a cover , a switch or a flip thing .
The team discussed the topic of potential user-friendly features for the old and the young . Marketing mentioned the probable insertion of tracking devices which recognize personal preferences , like voice activator , because people may easily forget the position of the remote controls in the room . However , later the team decided to put aside this idea for budget reasons . Then , Marketing mentioned RSI , or repetitive strain injury , which should be taken into consideration in the process of ergonomic design . Industrial Designer mentioned that this could probably be avoided by touching a button instead of pressing a button .
The team is going to design a basic television remote which looks cool and is safe to be used . As for the industrial design of the remote control , due to reasons of budget and simplicity , the remote control will use infrared signals instead of Bluetooth , and the energy source would be batteries .
Project Manager insisted the manifestation of company image on the remote control , like the slogan , symbol or other recognizable patterns . Marketing thought the remote controls should be in the same colour , while Project Manager thought it unnecessary . User Interface suggested that the pattern needs to be recognisable . Industrial Designer gave an example that the RR logo or thematic colours could be placed around the lock button .
The meeting began with a presentation on the prototype by Industrial Designer and User Interface and a double curved rubber prototype with anti-RSI buttons was displayed . Next , they discussed the cost of the remote which only cost ten seventy euros a unit and well under the budget of twelve fifty . Then , the team evaluated the remote according to seven criteria and it passed with flying colours as three criteria scored a one and others no more than three . Finally , the meeting ended with team building and a wrap-up , which Project Marketing concluded that the novel remote fit all criteria and the team did a great job .
The double curved prototype with anti-RSI buttons was ergonomic and comfortable to the size of the hand and to touch as it was made of rubber . The prototype was also easy and convenient to use as the important keys were right at the fingers . On the other hand , it brought fashion to electronics as the remote was offered in colours of black , yellow , blue and red , which contained fruit and vegetable elements . It was innovative and looked different so it would stand out from other remotes in the market .
The button to the thumb was the power button , the index and middle finger were channels up and down , whereas the ring finger and pinkie were volumes up and down . The blue button with the inscription of `` L '' was to lock , whereas the one with `` M '' was to mute . Moreover , a numeric keypad was on the top so users could directly key to a channel .
Industrial Designer recalled that some acquaintances have left- and right-handed people in the family but they all use the right-handed mouse for the computer . Marketing added that the remote only required pressing buttons and it would not be too hard . However , in the end , they agreed to have both in stock to make them more appealing .
Play-Doh would be used as it was very cheap , edible and chew-proof . The energy source would be kinetic power and electronics would be the simplest . For the case , it would be double curved and made of rubber . The interface was push buttons and they would be in special colours and forms . Considering the cost of the above materials , the remote would be within budget as it cost ten seventy euros a unit .
On a scale of one to seven , with one being true and seven being untrue , the remote scored a one for the look and feel unanimous . For new technology and being easy to use , it was given a mark of three and two respectively as kinetic energy was the only technological innovation and the remote was better geared for right-handed people . Next , the cost was given as it was under budget . Then , one was given for RSI and the amount of buttons as there were only necessary buttons . Finally , it scored a two for getting lost easily .
The remote fits all criteria and it was something novel . Also , it was marketable in the sense that other remotes would give users repetitive strain injury but this remote would do the complete opposite . Project Manager concluded that everyone had done a great job , both individually and as a team . Though there was some heated discussion during designing the remote , the communication was still great . For the technology that had been used during meetings , Marketing thought it was quite cool .
In this meeting , the team first gave presentations about their ideas most about remote control 's functional design based on research and knowledge they had already known . And then Project Manager delivered new requirements for the look , functions , and some others about the remote control . Later on the team brainstormed about many functional designs—where to put buttons and how much size they should be , the necessity of beep and flash , the design of covers , and the choice of LCD screen and rechargeable batteries—of the remote control based on new requirements , researches , current technology and production price . Finally they decided about the remote 's button design and had an optimistic attitude towards rechargeable things but there still needed more market research when they gave a sketch of the new product .
Marketing gave a presentation in the first place based on research and came up with ideas like what their remote control should look like , buttons design , whether the new product should have LCD screens . Marketing also suggested that there could be any chances that remote control could know users ' preference channels , and there would be a beep when they could n't find control . Then User Interface delivered a speech mainly on the size of buttons and remote control , and agreed to find remote control easier and increase its durability . At last , Industrial Designer did an analysis on what Marketing and User Interface said before and claimed that there still needed a lot to know but integration of materials meant less cost for the production and they should make up a different Morse code when some button was pressed .
Marketing found that seventy five percent of the users thought most remote controls ugly , and most people found it irritating when they could n't find their remote control . And another thing Marketing found important was that users had a feeling for speech recognition so that they could choose channels by voice . And they wanted maybe an LCD screen to search what 's on every channel .
First Industrial Designer raised questions like whether their remote control would be universal and should it be programmable or not , because they needed something like a mode to send out a different signal so that the remote can work in this way . Then the size of the remote was also put by Industrial Designer since there were already plenty of technical parts in it and it was quite complex to deal with material problems . But at last Industrial Designer came up with the idea of integration of materials and in this way , the new product would cost less .
At first Project Manager limited remote control 's appealing population to younger people less than 40 years , which meant their remote control should be trendy . And also corporate color and slogan should be recognizable on the remote control , which contributed to the idea of whether there should be a replaceable cover .
Their remote control could be purchased in a situation when users ' old remote had broken , so a universal remote control could be a must . Project Manager put forward this idea but did not know if there would be any chance to accomplish it easily , and Industrial Designer it would be possible but still needed some research .
Buttons design was all about volume , channel , power , and some other instant ideas . The team discussed their sizes , big or small , and places , up , center , or down , and also their arrangements , vertical or horizontal , and reached a conclusion that the power button could be on top . They came up with mute button as well but Project Manager did n't think it was important .
Industrial Designer raised an idea of making a rechargeable remote control which could have a wire and could charge itself when it was put in the electricity . Project Manager also had some responsive sparkles but they could hardly be applied . But at least one thing the team all agreed to was that a rechargeable remote was a comfort and people could pay for comfort .
Except uncertain problems such as LCD screen and speech recognition thing influenced by financial information , there would be many chances to have important buttons on top and bigger , different functional menus to adjust TV things , and very important idea of have replaceable covers , which could be designed to different colors meeting younger generation 's demands .
The meeting was about the potential consequences of the COVID-19 in Canada . The members put forward several petitions to ask for further attention for the people in need , say , the children , the workers who would suffer unemployment , and the creators who made a living on artworks , and also many other stakeholders from all walks of life , trying to ensure the life quality of their people during such a harsh time . Some of the group members mentioned some social problems , including the economic depression , racial discrimination , social security , and the environmental pollution , to call for a maintenance of the wealthy and healthy community in Canada . Through the discussion , it could be found that fortunately , some of the problems had been dealt with extra funds and cooperation with other related organizations .
When it comes to the governmental issues , some of the members , for example , Justin Trudeau and Jagmeet Singh had a heated debate over the way of the distribution of the fund . The root of their debate was the problem of systematic racism in the RCMP , and many other institutions at home . Therefore , a revolution might be needed in those institutions . In terms of the revolution , Jagmeet Singh pointed out that the governmental fund should be allocated to medical care instead of RCMP , for that during the outbreak of COVID-19 , emergent needs had shown in the medical field .
When talking about the issue of allocating the governmental fund , Yves-Fran questioned why their prime minister at present was acting like something between a prime minister with a majority and a monarch by divine right , he further pointed out that the government was meant to use the $ 14 million fund to interfere with the political affair of Quebec . But according to Justin Trudeau , the $ 14 million fund would actually be used to guarantee their people 's safety during the pandemic outbreak .
When discussing the governmental issue of dealing with systematic racism , Justin Trudeau mentioned that actually there had been serious systematic racism in most national institutions for the past two years , so he called for a revolution in those organizations to welcome equal cooperation with the black colleagues and indigenous communities . One of those institutions , RCMP , had another problem of the inappropriate fund allocation . According to Justin Trudeau , during the outbreak of the pandemic , the fund should be paid to the medical system but not the policing work .
Justin Trudeau was confident about the economic recovery after the pandemic , however , Cathy McLeod and Mona Fortier and some other members did not agree with him for that they thought Canada was undergoing an extreme uncertain time during which no one could foresee a bright future unless the prime minister kept the revenue report public . Furthermore , statistics showed that actually Canada had suffered decline in revenue in both the first and second season this year , and the forestry industry even reported depression before the outbreak . Various evidence showed a great challenge to the Canadian economy .
When talking about the uncertainty of Canadian economy and what the government should do , Cathy McLeod mentioned that the forestry industry even suffered depression before the outbreak of the COVID-19 . The plants closed , and thousands of workers were unemployed . Meanwhile , both the art industry and fishery industry had received support from the government . Therefore , Cathy McLeod asked for more attention to the forestry to help them go through the difficulty . In response to her petition , ministers said that they did consider a lot of the solutions , including further investment and industrial revolution .
Since many members called for more governmental support for their respective industry , MonaFortier , as the Minister of Middle-Class Prosperity and Associate Minister of Finance responded that Canadian government had financially supported more than 2.5 million jobs with wage subsidy . In addition , she promised to lay stress on supporting the industry , the workers , and all the Canadians in their next working phase , as well as keeping the revenue report updated and public .
The group mentioned that during the pandemic , countless individual businesses reported bankruptcy , which would do harm to social stability . Therefore , according to Mona Fortier , Canadian government had tried a lot to support them . However , not so many people were willing to accept the rent reduction , indicating that the policy might not be very effective . Another problem related to social safety was the handgun smuggling . Bill Blair , the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness , in response to the firearms seizure issue , promised to implement a stronger gun control in the near future .
The government said that they had carried out a plan of reducing the rent for those individual business to go through the harsh time of the pandemic , however , as Bob Saroya pointed out , not so many people were willing to accept the little fund from the government , which made the plan not effective at all . Mona Fortier , in response to him , promised to follow up and monitor those businessmen and lords , as well as pay more attention to their CMHC support program .
According to Bill Blair , gun violence in any of the communities was unacceptable , and it was important that governments and communities took steps to prevent guns from getting into the hands of criminals , especially during the special period of the pandemic outbreak . In terms of the gun smuggling , he also said that in order to thoroughly ban the violence , they had to keep an extremely strong attitude and carry out strict laws over the gun issue .
As John Williamson , the member from New Brunswick Southwest mentioned , what Service Canada had done was far from enough . Service Canada should be responsible for helping their people to adjust to the post-pandemic situation more quickly and recovering the national economy . The government members tried to persuade him that the government was doing a lot to make the revenue condition clear to the public , and their support fund was already prepared . Also in terms of the support fund , Bergeron went on to ask for a closer cooperation between Canadian government and Quebec to guarantee the regional development and stability during the pandemic .
Since there was a lot of absence in public service during the pandemic outbreak , John Williamson thought the Service Canada should be to blame for their irresponsibility . Mona Fortier justified themselves by illustrating that the government was always supporting the families , the industries , and the workers by offering support funds . However , what the public would like to see was complete and exact statistics of the financial support from the government , but not always claiming that `` they were doing hard '' .
When it comes to the cooperation between two levels of government , Bergeron said that Canadian government once promised to offer $ 14 million to support Quebec and other provinces to go through the difficulty , but only in targeted transfers . Notwithstanding how promising it seemed , under the current situation , what they needed might be an unconditional transfer , especially towards the medical care system . Under the pressure of the people , the government had to reconsider their cooperation of the armed forces in the CHSLDs , as well as their support for Quebeckers .
In their first meeting , the team members got familiar with each other through some icebreaker games . Project Manager started to introduce the new remote control project with the team 's financial goal . The unit price was determined to be 25 Euros . The production of each remote control would cost 12.5 Euros . The team would have to make sales amounting to 50 million Euros . Project Manager continued to assign individual tasks to the team members . Industrial Designer had worked out a rough plan for the first phase and would produce a working design . User Interface was supposed to specify the technical functions . Marketing would be responsible for market research . Users mainly expect the remote control to be user-friendly and handy . The team decided to focus on the basic functions at the first stage but make sure the extendibility of the functions as well .
Project Manager informed the team of the price issue and the financial goal . The unit price was determined to be 25 Euros . The production of each remote control would cost 12.5 Euros . The team would have to make sales amounting to 50 million Euros . Project Manager assigned individual tasks to the team members . Industrial Designer had worked out a rough plan for the first phase and would produce a working design . User Interface was supposed to specify the technical functions . Marketing would be responsible for market research .
Industrial Designer had started making an overview of the project 's three phases respectively . In the present phase , Industrial Designer focused on the basic function of the remote control . Batteries would be incorporated in the remote control to supply energy . Users would press buttons to activate or deactivate certain functions on the TV . In addition , Project Manager suggested that the remote control would use infrared light to communicate the signal to the TV apparatus or stereo . Industrial Designer agreed .
From a marketing perspective , the present function design phase consisted of user requirements . Marketing would mainly do internet research to get users ' feedback on existing products . Meanwhile , Marketing would find out the shortcomings of the current remote controls . According to the research results , the team could optimize their design . Marketing added that the team would probably be inspired by early remote control adopters .
Regretfully , Marketing did not get specific user requirements for now . Instead , User Interface made a contribution to the discussion . Users mainly expected the remote control to be user-friendly . To be more specific , the button size ought to be regular , and the remote control was expected to be a handy and small unit . It would be more satisfying if the zapping range was big enough so that the remote control could work from a distance .
Industrial Designer asked whether the remote control would be a multimedia product . Marketing also hoped to know the answer , for the team would have to decide what functions to incorporate in the remote control . Project Manager suggested that the team should first have a basic starting point and extend to other functions in the following meetings .
Marketing suggested that the remote control could only have one button and connect with Windows media center under the TV . The remote control could thus operate different devices at the same time . However , Industrial Designer pointed out that it would not be feasible to have only one button , for the remote control would need several other buttons for a video player , such as the play , the fast forward , and the stop button .
Project Manager firstly gave some main points of the design of remote control . The Internet would be the main focus and the proposal of multi-purpose remote control was clearly rejected . Besides , the customer group expanded to those younger than 40 . Then group members respectively gave presentations about the conception of the functions of remote control . Based on a questionnaire , Marketing concluded that the remote control should be simple , the buttons bigger and for minor functions . Industrial Designer rejected the idea of using Bluetooth and indicated that infrared would be better and within the budget . Industrial Designer believed that remote control should be simple and suggested sticking to basic things of remote control . User Interface also agreed to keep it simple and put forward the idea of using a touch screen and being user-friendly . Finally , Project Manager led the team to further discuss detailed questions like menus , parental control , update service .
Project Manager mentioned four points . Firstly , Project Manager pointed out that teletext was outdated and internet would be the main focus . Then it was proposed that the remote control would only be used for TV , rather than a multi-purpose one . What 's more , the project should target a new customer group , which was younger than 40 . Logo and slogan of the remote control were required to attract more attention , but it was not for now .
Based on those findings , Marketing thought the main focus should be put on the audience from 16 to 45 because they were the biggest share , which could bring more profit . Also , Marketing thought there was a need to improve the most used functions , and therefore , the buttons needed to be bigger and for minor functions . Less buttons and minor functions would make it easier and quicker for users to learn . What 's more , a placeholder would help users to keep remote controls .
Industrial Designer compared infrared technology with Bluetooth technology , and pointed out that the latter cost more . To build a remote control with Bluetooth was impossible within the budget . He suggested using infrared technology . When it came to the speech function , Industrial Designer did n't give a clear answer for not being sure about the cost , and he/she just left it as something to explore .
Industrial Designer first explained how the remote control worked and how people could build one . Based on this , he rejected the idea of using Bluetooth , which was proposed during the last meeting , by pointing out that the cost would be over the budget . From the aspect of Industrial Designer , he/she recommended to keep the remote control simple and still use infrared technology . When it came to the design and functionality , Industrial Designer thought that they should stick to the basic things .
User Interface also suggested to keep the remote control simple and ease down on the functionality . Keeping the remote control simple meant that fewer functions were involved , or at least less buttons were made , which could be solved by a hierarchy structure supported by a touch screen . Besides , User Interface mentioned the importance of being user friendly . According to User Interface , the remote control should be only used for TV .
Project Manager emphasized that the main point in this meeting was to keep the remote control as simple as possible , but more options and functions , like the menu and the parental control could be added . User Interface suggested making a remote control which had a functionality for all the TVs and users could enter the codes to set their TVs . Marketing proposed that people could go to the service center or the shop for the updates of the remote control .
First , the project manager briefly reviewed the last meeting . According to market research , Marketing suggested adopting modern appearance , reducing buttons , increasing positioning and voice recognition functions . From the perspective of technical function design , User Interface emphasized that the user should be the centre , reduce the buttons , focus on modifying the shape of the remote control , and do not waste the budget to design the universal remote controller . Industrial Designer had come up with the option of cheap and sustainable batteries , infrared lights and voice recognition technology . Industrial Designer also offered mouse-like scrolling and clicking functions , as well as specific remote control shapes .
Through market research , Marketing believed that the modern appearance of the remote control is important . Useless buttons can be combined or multi-functional remote control can be designed . Voice recognition function and positioning function are necessary .
User Interface advocated to adjust to meet the needs of users from the perspective of technical function design . It is mainly user-centred , reducing buttons and making it easier to use . In addition , User Interface suggested that the general remote controller proposed by marketing will increase the budget and button , so the research should be stopped and focused on the remote control 's appearance design .
Industrial Designer believed that the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another system . The remote control needed an energy source to supply power to the integrated circuit , and had a chip and related information to control the infrared lamp . In the design , it can make the battery and infrared lamp cheaper and more sustainable . It can also add the design of speech recognition interface according to the market research provided by Marketing .
From the last meeting , Project Manager concluded that the team needed to design a modern , interesting , distinctive , sturdy , positioning remote control . In order to be distinctive , the team can adopt a spherical or keyboard shape design . Based on the market research , Project Manager thought that a rechargeable battery or solar cell is necessary , and the setting of the positioner and the reduction of button number is feasible . Project Manager wanted the remote control to be used only for TV , which can save the budget . For voice recognition , he thought it was unaffordable for young people , so the design was abandoned .
The project manager thought that the shape of the remote control can be designed as a bone or cube to reduce the number of buttons , and add the company 's yellow and grey color . Marketing believed that anti lost equipment can be designed . Since it 's a one-handed project , Marketing proposed to design a special version for left-hand users . User Interface thought that the sphere is not suitable for one hand use , the rectangle variant can be used . The more important the button is , the bigger it is and the closer it is to the thumb for easy operation .
Industrial Designer proposed to design mouse-like click function and the scrolling function which is the simplest in technology . In addition , some small protuberances can be designed under the remote control , which is more convenient for users from the perspective of ergonomics , and the battery can be installed from the engineering point of view . He also proposed a two in one remote control . The small remote control has simple basic functions and is easy to carry . The large remote control is not easy to lose when it is fixed on furniture such as a sofa or table .
The meeting between the Children , Young People and Education Committee and the Welsh Government was considered as an evidence session to the continuation of the inquiry into targeted funding to improve educational outcomes . The meeting started by discussing thoroughly about the use of pupil development grant funding in different sectors and the meeting believed that PDG would largely cover each aspect of students ' rights and support the school services at the same time . Later , the meeting also agreed about the PDG 's contribution to special kids and more able and talented streams . The meeting also talked about changes in key positions to ensure smooth adoption of the new curriculum . In the end , several issues regarding different phases of education and connection between different sectors were brought up and currently , they would work out the final stage .
Meilyr Rowlands introduced that the grant had been targeted far better by now than it was originally and it was very specific towards the different use of the fund in each aspect of the school day , especially for those students eligible for free school meals . However , Llyr Gruffydd AM questioned that research by Ipsos MORI and the Wales Institute of Social and Economic Research , Data and Methods had shown that there was some kind of blurring . Meilyr Rowlands indicated that although schools were not following the exact process , the spirit of PDG was included , which was fair enough .
Meilyr Rowlands introduced that Estyn had always been very strongly focused on improving the performance of more able pupils . More inspections were added to this certain group of students , especially at the relative performance of different groups and different performances of boys and girls . Currently the main strategy was always to identify where there were weaknesses to ensure the overall process of a typical school day .
Michelle Brown AM suggested that only two thirds of secondary and primary schools were making effective use of the PDG while the meaning , a third , were still not using that PDG effectively . Meilyr Rowlands regarded this issue of lacking good leadership and suggested improving attendance , offering extra-curricular activities , literacy and numeracy support , tracking pupils would improve the process , especially to engage the learners .
Claire Morgan first suggested that in the best schools , the headteachers consider themselves to be community leaders as well as headteachers , and they often set up arrangements where they engaged directly with the families of disadvantaged children or children who were under achieving generally . And PDG would be used for appointing staff to these positions to connect the family with the school .
Claire Morgan suggested that the first thing to do was to finish the inspection report , and the government should highlight the practice there . In this way , detailed outcomes of the methods would be listed and would be shared in the conferences where different schools join in it . But Hefin David AM challenged that it was not engaging and Claire Morgan argued that the learning process worthed trying .
Meilyr Rowlands indicated that it was quite difficult to identify the cause and the effect in terms of the PDG but what was clear was that there had been some improvements by now . Using the same measuring method , in 2017 , there was a re-widening of the attainment gap between pupils on free school meals and those not on free school meals . However , currently secondary schools were driven overly by performance indicators and the result turned out to be satisfying , though the exact result still remained unclear .
To answer Mark Reckless AM 's question , Meilyr Rowlands explained that any good organisation would welcome external scrutiny . Since there had been in the past systems of quinquennial reviews , it would be healthy to have that sort of external view , especially when Estyn aimed at improving the current situation and adopting new changes .
Meilyr Rowlands suggested that it was hard to compare Ofsted and Education Scotland and the Education Training Inspectorate in Northern Ireland with the decision to have Estyn as an independent body inspecting schools and other institutions in Wales . Different institutions did things slightly differently , but the government had benefited a lot from each one of them . Meilyr Rowlands concluded that the use of the nominee and peer inspectors in particular supported the whole process in Wales .
Darren Millar AM suggested that it had been one of the tough problems that was identified in the past and it was hard to travel the good practice to local authorities , regional consortia , and the Welsh Government efficiently in a short period . Meilyr Rowlands agreed that the problem was highly associated with the foundation phase and training should be included in both a pupil-led learning experience and a teacher-led learning experience , though they shared differences with each other .
John Griffiths AM suggested that one way was through community-focused schools that were very much accessible to the community , linked well with outside organisations , having an extended school-day offer . Meilyr Rowlands agreed that it was a good method and the government was delighted to support the remaining schools which still participate in the process in every way . It was concluded that a new mechanism should be added to avoid misunderstanding the role of community-focused schools .
Meilyr Rowlands agreed that indeed in previous annual reports , the difference between primary and secondary did exist . Nearly three quarters of primary schools were doing well and about half of secondary schools were the same . The reason seemed to be there was a widening of gaps when it moved from primary to secondary , but also it was from foundation phase to key stage 2 to key stage 3 to key stage 4 . To conclude , Meilyr Rowlands suggested that a whole range of issues should be considered to help explain what had been identified about the gap .
The government highlighted special schools as a successful sector in the annual report , since over 90 per cent of them were good or better . Schools cared for children with emotional and behavioural difficulties were improving and they worked as a team instead of competing with each other . Although the independent special sector over the cycle was slightly different , the overal achievements were significant .
This meeting focused on the conception of the functional design of the new remote control . Industrial Designer evaluated several components in the technical design of the product and gave his personal preferences , especially on the chip and the material to use in the construction . Then User Interface presented a general layout of the functionality , the design of which should follow two principles : simpleness and customizability . Marketing , in his turn , explained the current market trend based on the results of his questionnaires on user requirements . The group also discussed where the remote control would be manufactured by taking into account the price of the local labour force .
The group came to an agreement regarding a wooden case with rubber buttons and also determined on using the advanced chip on print which could integrate a sensor and a speaker . They also decided to install a microphone in the device so that the remote control could make sounds when it got lost . The group discussed over cost-efficiency of a display , whose adoption still remained to be decided .
The group showed approval regarding the concept of a wooden case , because Industrial Designer , during his presentation , evaluated different materials on the basis of manufacturing input as well as the conceptual features of the product . After eliminating rubber , plastic and titanium , the only option left was wood . Not only is it environmental-friendly , but the users could also have their customized curving on the case . But Industrial Designer suggested that the buttons should be made out of rubber .
User Interface proposed to reconsider the necessity of adopting a display in consideration of two factors . One was that the television screen already made a big display , the other was that the cost-efficiency of a display was doubtful . In view of the cost constraint , sacrificing the display feature could be a reasonable option . Project Manager then asked Marketing to conduct research on this subject before making the final decision about the adoption of the display .
User Interface presented a general layout of remote control functionalities . The ergonomic shape of the remote control could raise product customizability . User Interface proposed to incorporate a flip screen and to add a LCD light to show battery life . User Interface also gave suggestions on possible positioning of the key pad . To summarize , User Interface preferred the design to be simple and clear .
User Interface proposed that buttons , when pressed , gave audio or tactile feedback so that users were aware that the device understood his message . For instance , speech recognition could be an option . Besides , voice control should be able to be turned off so that the remote control would n't accidentally send instructions to televisions .
User Interface suggested adding a flip screen on the remote control in order to prevent users from accidentally pressing buttons and bring unwilling results , especially for families with children . Given that the products were to be made out of wood , Industrial Designer proposed to use a copper hinge . But User Interface disagreed by pointing out that this might increase the weight of the product .
In this meeting , the team was very satisfied with the three prototypes presented . However , they had to take the budget limits into consideration . Their current cost per remote control was fourteen point six Euros , while the budget required them to cut two more Euros . Therefore , a series of changes were done in order to meet the criteria , such as making the remotes flattened . In the end , the team was asked to make an evaluation about the project . All of them were very satisfied with the final product .
According to Project Manager , currently , the new remote controls would cost fourteen point six Euros each . Unfortunately , that was two Euros over the budget . Then the team had a little discussion on how to reduce the cost . Eventually , the cost was reduced to eleven Euros sixty by adjusting two parts of the design . That left them plenty of room to add some other designs to the existing models . The final cost of the new remote controls was set at twelve Euros fifty each .
In general , the team came up with two ways to reduce the costs . First , they would essentially remain the same shape as the prototypes , but just have it flattened . In User Interface 's words , it would be more like a traditional remote control . Second , the team reached a consensus that the design of double curves shall be changed into a single curve since it was the biggest expense there . Luckily , after the discussion , the overall cost of the new remote controls went down to eleven Euros sixty .
Through a series of previous adjustments , the cost of the new remote controls had been effectively reduced . The team then decided to use some of the remaining cost budget to add another design to the new remotes . After discussion , the team thought it might be a good idea to have the slogan on the front because there was obviously more space there and the current slogan was not in an ideal place . With this little change , the overall cost of the new remote each went up to twelve Euros fifty , still under the budget limit .
Most time of the discussion of this meeting was devoted into the evaluation of the new remote controls . According to the whole team , this project was excellent because it was creative and with great leadership and teamwork . Also , the technical stuff was brilliant . Lots of new ideas were found , such as glow-in-dark , new shapes , etc . Generally , they all gave a thumb up to the new remote controls . The overall evaluation is around two .
In order to make the final evaluation , the team needed to give rating to these products . Of the design of the three fruits , the teams agreed to give two points . As for the trend , since fruits and vegetables were quite populous , the final rating was three . In terms of the company strategy , the rating was one because it perfectly conformed to the strategy . The overall evaluation is around two , which was quite good .
Basically , the dissent mainly came from Marketing . According to Marketing , the company failed to offer enough options to the customers ( only three options ) . Therefore , customers were limited . By limiting the customers , sales and profits would definitely be limited as well . However , User Interface disagreed with him because he believed that electronics were not the same as other products , for example chocolate . There were not always quite so many choices in electronics .
Unlike the last meeting , the team further discussed the details about the features they wanted on their new remote controls this time . First , they unanimously agreed that their design shall be the combination of beauty and fashion . Second , after looking at all the other designs existing in the market now , they drew a conclusion that the new remotes would be standardly shaped and children-friendly . Lastly , most of the time was devoted to the discussion about the details of the desired features : rechargeable battery , blue main body and yellow slogan , fruits based shapes and sponge latex rubber material .
According to User Interface , most remote controls had an inconsistent layout , thus was difficult to use . Also , they were mostly in boring shape , grey and quite space-agey with too many buttons . Therefore , after discussion , the team decided to avoid those flaws they had discovered . Basically , the new designs would be with programmability function , organic shape and consistent layout .
In general , the team only collected the flaws of the existing remotes . According to the User Interface , the existing remotes were difficult to use because of the inconsistent layout , too many buttons and shape problems . For each problem , the team tried to give the solution . For example , their new remotes would have a standard layout , limited buttons and organic shapes . It was believed that by solving all these problems , the new remotes would be easy for the customers to use .
The User Interface showed the pictures of one kind of remotes with scrolls on it , working as the middle buttons . If the consumers wanted to find a certain item , they just needed to scroll it and when they reached the required ones , they pressed the middle of the scroll . Although the team was not satisfied with the colour , shape and buttons of the existing , they all agreed that the function of a scroll was a good idea .
In the second half of the meeting , the team discussed the details of the features and appearances of the new remotes . Lots of ideas and proposals were raised , but many of them were denied or modified later . In the end , the team reached a consensus that their new remotes would have batteries that could be recharged , pale yellow slogans , fruits-based shapes and sponge rubber material .
The team was offered a bunch of options about the material of the outer casing from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , latex , double-curved , curved , sponge , etc . After discussion , they decided that they would have the sponge rubber as their outer casing because it had the elasticity and durability which they needed . Also , this kind of material was cheap to cast .
The Industrial Designer first proposed to use the shape of a banana . However , the Project Manager thought it might be a little bit childish . Then , the User Interface suggested drawing on the kind of fruits and vegetable shape . After a period of discussion , the team decided to design two or three shapes and had a public survey , letting the public choose what they want .
This is the first Real Reaction 's development meeting for the new remote control . The team members got acquainted with each other and Project Manager introduced the financial target . Each product would be priced at 25 Euros and a 50 % profit is made , aiming at making an overall profit of 50 million Euros . In terms of style and design , the remote control should be stylish to stay competitive . Also , it should be made dependable and of medium size and the user interface can be made into face-plates . The material should be plastic as it is the lightest . To market the remote control , the project team can launch parallel marketing schemes to fit both customers who value the remote control 's appearance and those who value its practicability . To market interchangeable fronts , the team can either get control in a set of colours or with face-plates .
Marketing proposed to make a stylish remote control . User Interface preferred a remote control that was comfortable to hold . In order to make buttons easy to find , User Interface pointed out that they could be made concave . Project Manager agreed and supposed that the buttons could be made illuminated so that people could see them in dark rooms .
As Marketing proposed to make a remote control that does n't look like remote control , Project Manager was concerned that customers would n't recognize it and just pass it .
User Interface suggested that remote controls should be comfortable to hold and the buttons could be made concave so that customers could feel them .
The remote control should be made dependable and of medium size . In terms of industrial design , the user interface can be made into face-plates , and the material should be plastic as it is the lightest .
Industrial Designer believed that remote controls should be made dependable and its size should be moderate since if it is too big , it can be awkward to hold , but if it is too small , it will be easy to get lost .
User Interface suggested that the remote control could be made of plastics because it was the lightest and proposed that they could make the remote control different , maybe with face-plates .
This meeting is mainly about three presentations from three team members to talk about what the team is supposed to be doing . First , it was the Industrial Designer 's presentation on energy source and case material ; then , User Interface introduced potential buttons , the layout design , and the color of the remote control ; and at last , Marketing made a presentation on three important marketing points that the team should pay attention to , which are fancy appearance , innovative technology and user-friendliness . Various discussions went on among team members concerning their presentations .
They discussed the energy source , which can be a basic battery , a hand dynamo , a kinetic provision of energy like that on watches , or a combination of battery and solar power . Each kind of energy source has its own advantages and disadvantages . The basic battery costs less , and the kinetic provision of energy could be cooler and fancier . Regarding the design of the case , Industrial Designer claimed that it could be a general fact one , a curved one or a double curved one which is more ergonomic . Concerning the material of the case , Industrial Designer claimed that it could be plastic , latex , rubber , wood or titanium . At last they decided that the control is going to be a double curved rubber case , with rubber push-buttons and basic battery .
Marketing motioned for the idea of the sample sensor , which is something like a sample speaker , which has the function of voice recognition , and can help switch channels on hearing the direction of users . But this idea was abandoned because of unnecessity and expensiveness .
User Interface made a presentation on buttons the control should include and on the layout of the buttons . The team vetoed the idea of the speech recognition interface which is expensive and unnecessary . At last the team decided not to have any sort of display , but a simple straight set of push-buttons , with a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , a numerical keypad , and a lock button or a cover . Then they discussed some supplements like colours or particular gimmicky bits . User Interface proposed the utilization of a couple of colours like black and yellow , with special parts like the RR logo in yellow . User Interface suggested having a rubber case for safety reasons .
Marketing made a presentation on important aspects the team need to pay attention to concerning the remote control market . A most important aspect is its look and feel , so that the remote control has to look and feel fancier to meet customer 's demands . The second point is that it should be technologically innovative . And then they found that the decisions the team had already made on interface did n't match the first two points that Marketing had raised . Then they discussed the Bluetooth function which was turned down and on the kinetic provision of energy . User Interface suggested using squeezable rubber which could be an energy generator . The third point that Marketing raised was easy to use . She suggested that next year 's fashion would be fruits and vegetables so the team had the idea of making some buttons into fruit shapes . Regarding the color of the control , Project Manager had the idea of marketing the control in different colors for different groups of people like iPod .
Marketing thought that Bluetooth is a fancy function that may attract customers . However , Project Manager reckoned that the Bluetooth function means that users need a television that has Bluetooth function . Televisions rarely have this function . Marketing thought that it would be a new trend and they need to move away from what they already had and go creative . But after all the proposal of Bluetooth was suspended .
In the discussion , team members did presentations and talked about the design of the remote control . Project Manager introduced the aim of the second meeting and new project requirement . Project Manager said that the team did not need to pay attention to teletext and lighting adaptive . Then Industrial Designer , User Interface and Marketing gave presentations respectively . Industrial Designer proposed that they could add software functionalities on programmable chips and could use the FPGA . User Interface focused on reducing the number of buttons and recommended navigation buttons . Marketing discussed a lot of ideas including using a speech recogniser , the size of the remote control and lighting adaptive options . In the end they discussed some topics like teletext and accessing the Internet .
The team would add some software functionalities on programmable chips browsing by the content or things like that . They would use the FPGA for the functionalities and use chargers rather than batteries .
Industrial Designer said that FPGA was a field programmable gateway array . The Bluetooth chip was just responsible to make the communication between the two devices , but the FPGA was different . The FPGA would produce the data to send and it was for software .
The remote control did not need very much power . Users could put it on the charger when they did not need to use it . People do n't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out , so a charger could be more user friendly .
Marketing thought that users would be interested in a speech recogniser and it could help users choose the program then reduce the number of buttons . The remote control should be small and comparatively cheap . Not many people were interested in lighting adapting options , so it was for the Industrial Designer and Users Interface designer to decide if it 's going to be working or not .
The team would design a speech recogniser in the remote control to help choose the program . It would be small . They would balance the features and the cost when designing it .
Lighting adaptive was a little bit complex . It was possible but not in this project .
Industrial Designer and User Interface gave a presentation about two versions of the prototype , one with and one without LCD . They both had a speech recognition system , microphone , a few number of buttons , rechargeable batteries and different modules . The prototype with LCD was too expensive , while the other one was quite cheap . Marketing made evaluation criteria . The scale included fancy look and feel , innovativeness and easy to use . Then Marketing asked Industrial Designer and User Interface to give scores towards two versions of the prototype according to the scale . Both Industrial Designer and User Interface gave average points to look and feel , high points to innovativeness and to easy to use . At the end of the meeting , group members did project evaluation . They felt good about leadership and teamwork .
Industrial Designer and User Interface gave a presentation about two versions of the prototype , one with and one without LCD . As for the one with LCD , users could choose the direction and if they pushed on it , it 's considered like an enter function . There was also a button which was like a mouse . This prototype had microphone arrays for the speech recognition system and switch for controlling . The remote control needed rechargeable batteries , but the type and the number of batteries were not sure . This prototype cost fifteen dollars and it was high above the budget . The second prototype was basically the same as the first one . However , it used buttons to navigate and enter . This one cost four dollars . The remote control had different modules for different groups of people . The set might use a material like titanium or lithium . User Interface said that features which cost much could be optional so the price could be flexible . Project Manager said that the cost of the whole second plan was below the budget .
The switch for controlling was around the microphone , so the microphone could easily put up the speeches from anywhere . The microphone was in the side , so when users were browsing the LCD they would not be close to the microphone . Industrial Designer said that the place could be adjusted .
The product would have basic functions and if users wanted more they need to pay more . For example , if users wanted LCD and speech recognisers with the microphone , they would pay more , else they could just buy the simpler one .
Marketing made evaluation criteria . The first thing was fancy look and feel , the second was innovativeness , the third was easy to use . Then Marketing asked Industrial Designer and User Interface to give scores towards two versions of the prototype according to the scale . Both Industrial Designer and User Interface gave three or four points to look and feel , six points to innovativeness and also six points to easy to use . The team decided to make the remote control without LCD and to improve the design to make it fancy . They would have all the functions in the same set , but some functions , like speech recognition , would be optional . The team would look into the shape and material of the set .
If one remote control had a children module and another one had not , maybe parents would easily lose the one with children module . Those modularities increased the production cost , so having all functions in the same set could be cheaper .
The remote control might be made into fruit or vegetable types . So the team might have to change some components , but it would not cost much . The PCB would be the same for all , but only the exterior shape was different for all . They could propose the customers with skins . The team would look into the material .
Project Manager first recapped the previous meeting , concluding that the remote should be compact , user-friendly and could function like speech recognition . Next , the presentation of the bright blue snail shaped prototype was made by Industrial Designer and User Interface , introducing the appearance and features of the remote . Then , feedback was given regarding the prototype , which was mainly positive and speech recognition and cute appearance were decided as its star feature . Afterwards , the team discussed the financing of the remote , which should be within the budget of twelve fifty euros . Finally , the meeting ended with a project evaluation , which everyone was satisfied with the product and dynamic of the team , and team building .
The main function of the remote would be sending messages to the TV . For the interface , it should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons and switches to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etc . Interface Designer said that looks would be very important for the remote so the remote should be child-friendly with few buttons and could be colourful with star-shaped or other shaped buttons . An oversized remote was presented but was challenged by the team . Speech recognition was a feature that Interface Designer wanted to include .
Making a recyclable and colourful case out of plastic that was strong without using harmful materials was proposed . For the components , there would be a resistor , a capacitor , a diode transistor , resonator , and if possible , a rechargeable battery . Also , it should have an integrated circuit board that was highly sophisticated , temperature resistant and inexpensive . Furthermore , it was hoped that there would be a timer or alarm . For the working design , morse code would be relayed to the generator for amplification after buttons were pressed . The team thought push buttons were better than scroll wheel as the former was more practical and cheap .
Apart from being small , easy to use and eye-catching , the remote should have buttons , a soft feel and a trendy design , possibly incorporating fruit and vegetable elements . Marketing proposed having one or two star features that the campaign could be built on and speech recognition could be one of the options . Also , the energy source should be a battery . It was highlighted that the remote should get to the market before the competition .
The prototype was attractive , bright blue and snail shaped with buttons in different colours such as yellow . It was compact so it could easily fit in the hand and buttons could be easily accessed . Moreover , the material for the case would be plastic but the buttons would be made with soft rubber . For the light emitting diode of the LED , it would be fluorescent green and it would be a bulb like an ordinary infrared . Last but not least , there would be an oyster-shaped holder for the remote .
Features of the remote include signal-emitting LED , on-off switch , mute button , nine channel buttons , two buttons for increasing or decreasing volume , two buttons for scrolling up or down channels and menu button at the centre , which would control the colour , sharpness , brightness etc . Also , there would be an elongated shaped swapping button that was slightly flexible . If it was turned to the left , the TV would change to the previous channel that the user was watching and if to the right , the next channel . The remote has an inbuilt voice recognizer that would recognize the user 's voice and act accordingly .
Marketing liked how users could reach all the buttons with one thumb , even for someone with a small hand , so users did not need to shift it around or operate with two hands . Also , it was good that the on-off button was in a prominent place and the colours of the remote were attractive . Mute buttons were on either side so it would work for left- or right-handed people . On the other hand , channel buttons would be inscribed with numbers and the rest would be marked with easily recognized symbols that would be ideal for the international market .
Marketing suggested that they could do something funny for the shell as the snail was known to be slow and they could have a comic effect about how this was a rapid snail . User Interface and Industrial Designer agreed .
Voice recognition would be a major selling point as it was unusual and there were no remotes that had this function in the same price range . Another selling point would be its appearance as it would be the cutest remote control . The snail image could be used as a visual attraction . Practicality would not be one of its special features because all competition would feature this .
Battery would be the energy source and the electronics would be regular chips on print . For the case , it would be double-curved and made from plastic in special colours , whereas buttons would come in different forms and colour and would be made in rubber or wood . In addition , there would be no clock . With the cost of eight twenty , the remote was within budget with the cost of voice recognizer excluded . Only four thirty euros was left to cover it so they would have to settle with what they get within the budget with no money for other special features .
The prototype should be shown to people of various age and socio-economic groups to see if there should be any fine-tuning . Also , it should be shown to consumer research groups for feedback . Marketing concluded that the prototype reached the goal of being biomorphic , soft and compact with bright and warm colours and felt good in hands . All in all , Marketing believed that it was a great product and would be saleable in the market .
On a scale of one to seven , with one being good and seven being the worst , everyone rated the shape and colour of the remote with a one . The size was given a mark of four by Marketing , a two by Project Manager and the others gave it a one . For the feel , which included texture and comfort , it scored a three with User Interface and a two for the rest . Functionality was given a two by User Interface and Marketing and a three by the other two . All in all , the team was satisfied with the product .
Industrial Designer suggested that there could be more buttons and the buttons could be smaller . If having the speech recognition feature was feasible , buttons would be added for recording speech so Marketing suggested that one of the mute buttons could be eliminated to make room and Industrial Designer and User Interface agreed . Marketing also suggested volume control could be put on one button .
Marketing , User Interface and Industrial Designer thought Project Manager did a good job . Project Manager believed that the teamwork was great and this opinion was echoed by the other three team members . Whiteboard was used during the meeting but digital pens were not and the team agreed that they could have used the whiteboard a bit more . The team mostly used the slide because it was better positioned .
The meeting participants discuss results from experiments and challenges that the model was facing . There was a significant server side delay , so they could not accommodate silence detection . Members noted that reducing model dimensions had a detrimental effect on model performance . The professor wanted to know the size of words that the word error rate was calculated on and explained that there would be no new training . From this point , they can start talking about future directions and work on fixing the system .
The team used OGI features that then passed through a contextualized KLT , an MLP , and a low-pass filter . The highly mismatched Italian part was still not working well . The team tried using silence detection to improve performance , but the results were not too promising .
PhD C explained that there was no room left for silence detection because of the server side delay . They were working out a compromise between the handset delay and the server delay , but the delay was too large at the moment .
The professor thought that the results in the experiment without silence detection were okay as well . He thought some sort of weighted measure between other features should result in good performance .
It was time for the team to rely on the models they had created so far to fix the system . They were deciding when to fix it . The professor explained that they should do so by Tuesday , and when they get new data later in the week , they need not train on it .
PhD C thought that it would be worthwhile to test on a single KLT . The professor agreed that since it would be pretty low-maintenance , the team should do that , but only if they can fit it in .
The professor noted that the most important improvements over the years have been due to finding bugs . He also informed the team of some IBM processors that were available to them at the University of Washington . He finally congratulated them on their efforts .
The team was starting a transcription project for which they would have to collect a lot of speech data and then transcribe it . The meeting covered the pipeline they would use to create their data set . The team started by discussing the technical issues with their own recording equipment and then moved onto a general overview of the entire pipeline . Then , the team narrowed down on how they could carry out transcriptions . Various ideas were thrown around , but the team did not seem convinced that a software could do the task . They would need human annotators due to the granularity they were aiming for . Then , the team talked abut transcription conventions ; what should be annotated and how ? The team also talked about the interface they could use for transcriptions . Finally , the team ended with a discussion on the time it takes to annotate and the electronics involved .
The team discussed the various institutions , like University of Washington and Santa Barbara , that were involved in the transcription task . The team wanted to know how diversity of sound would effect their data . The team also wanted more corpuses and have more students at future meetings .
The team thought that their corpus was new and unique and that others would be interested in using it . They decided that they should keep DVD 's , tapes , LDC 's and other formats for sending the data to others . And they wanted to standardize their data formats .
Santa Barbara had released a corpus recently that had many styles of speech . The project used DAT recorders and had a lot of far field recordings . The recording in general were very clean .
The team was thinking about the best way to incorporate the recording infrastructure in the room . They considered putting tapes in the lip of the table and LEDs to indicate the channel was live . The team also discussed power issues
The team thought that a certain amount of rewiring was necessary to ensure a stable power supply . They also wanted to ensure that their equipment would not be plugged out . One way to solve this would be to build some sort of cabinet and collect the cables in one spot to avoid clutter .
The meeting was about the fiscal and social influence of Brexit , especially focusing on the Wales education system . The group was worrying that Brexit would cut down the support from the EU to the UK , thus putting the Wales Universities in great dilemma . Besides , the fact was that the less fiscal support from the EU , the less foreign students would apply for the Wales universities . The members talked about several possible solutions , for instance , adjusting the syllabus to better meet both the students ' and the lecturers ' needs and providing them with better career prospects . What also mattered was the immigration policy which would be alluring to the foreign students if being reconsidered carefully .
The group was focusing on the potential influence to the Wales education system due to the Brexit . The members mentioned many institutions like the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales and showed that these institutions had taken much action to deal with the problems . Some of the institutions funded higher education in Wales , and others might help those universities find a better way to transit . What the group aimed at was cooperating with the institutions and help the situation become better .
When discussing the dilemma that the Wales universities were faced with at the moment , Kirsty Williams pointed out that many factors would affect the fiscal situation of the universities , including whether it would be a `` no deal '' scenario or a `` deal '' one . Even though most worries were towards the `` no deal '' scenario , Huw Morris was confident that the higher education Brexit working group had been meeting since September 2016 and recently officials had been visiting individual institutions to ensure that they were fully prepared for the potential fund problems .
Eluned Morgan had been actively engaging with the FE sector and he found that those colleges are much localized , with only 71 EU apprenticeships and staff . The group was working hard to ensure that these 71 people would safely go through such a chaotic period . What 's also important was that as for FE , the relationship between the apprenticeships and the working community mattered much , which means they might have to improve the relationship between these 71 EU people and the local community .
Hefin David pointed out that Wales was the only country in the UK that witnessed a significant drop in applications from EU students . The group should have noticed that the available funding for those EU students had changed , and that was one of the reasons why fewer of them applied for Wales universities this year . But fortunately , according to Kirsty Williams , close cooperation with HEFCW and other institutions were always on the agenda to make sure that Wales universities were fully prepared .
Hefin David thought that the Wales government should be to blame for the fewest EU students applying for Wales universities this year , however , Kirsty Williams considered it was too early to jump to the conclusion . Not until November would they conduct the first census to get an exact number of the students enrolled . In addition , Kirsty Williams pointed out the fact that international students outside the EU make up a bigger proportion of students not from the UK who came to Wales institutions . There was no need to be so anxious about the number of the present applications .
Kirsty Williams thought Swansea University was quite a good example for them to learn from . During such a dilemma , Swansea University found a solution that provided an attractive curriculum and offered courses that people really wanted to take . They delivered their curriculum in a fashion way , guaranteed good teaching , and had an appealing infrastructure , which all made good use to attract potential applicants . That was exactly what other institutions needed to do at present .
The group laid their stress on mainly three aspects in terms of dealing with the problem at an official level , which respectively were adding more funding to the universities , implementing a new immigration policy , and asking for the minister 's help . With adequate funding , the institutions would be more likely to satisfy the research needs from the students . Similarly , a more robust immigration policy might make it more appealing for those who would like to set down in Wales . Last but not least , making the minister be aware of the serious problem would also be important that the problem would then be brought to national meetings and discussed by more officials .
When discussing the funding to support Wales universities to go through the financial problems , Julie Morgan mentioned that they have funded Wales universities with 6.4 million dollars in 2017-18 . Kirsty Williams added that they had actually made an additional resource of £5 million available to mitigate the freeze in tuition fees , and another £5 million had been made available to HEFCW to kick-start the work on postgraduate support . With the adequate funding , Kirsty Williams believed that there would be little need to worry about the fiscal problems of Wales universities .
According to Kirsty Williams , he was not quite in favor of a new immigration policy at first , for when post-study work visas were first issued in the south-east of England , the outcome was not so satisfying . However , his attitude had changed . As the locals usually did not take foreign students as immigrants , the government should treat the foreign students and those who came from EU as the same , which is to say , a new immigration system should be set to ensure that EU students and all the other foreign ones would receive the same treatment when seeking a job in Wales .
The group mentioned that Wales government had promised a multi-annual commitment that it would help the Wales universities to get through the transition period and operate well with enough funding . However , some of the members thought that they could not always rely on the government and should have a budget plan for themselves . For fear that they might only receive the governmental funding for those apprentices , the group agreed to keep the apprenticeship firmly , even if some areas like England had abandoned it .
While talking about the official commitments to help the Wales universities to get through the transition period , Suzy Davies compared the two kinds of multi-annual commitments that one was related to revenue and the other to capital . She did not think that either of them would work , however , according to Eluned Morgan , the official commitment related to capital would matter more under such a transition period . Even if most people would focus on the revenue , they should pay attention to the capital for that it is exactly the capital that ensured the institutions to operate well under the dilemma .
When discussing the official commitments , Eluned Morgan had great confidence in the government that they would provide firm support for the Wales universities . But as for Llyr Gruffydd , he did not think that the institutions would be able to rely on the official funding much , and more importantly , if they would like to enter into the agreements at present , they would interrupt their current work , which would also put themselves in great risk .
The group discussed efforts to train and test the Aurora group 's HTK-based recognition system on ICSI 's digits corpus . Members also discussed efforts to produce forced alignments from a selection of Meeting Recorder data . Performance in both tasks was adversely affected by the manner of recording conditions implemented and difficulties attributing utterances to the appropriate speakers . While debugging efforts resulted in improved forced alignments , dealing with mixed channel speech and speaker overlap remains a key objective for future work . The group is additionally focused on a continued ability to feed different features into the recognizer and then train the system accordingly .
For comparing Meeting Recorder digits results , it was decided that the Aurora HTK-based system should be tested on data from the TI digits corpus
The script for extracting speaker ID information will require modifications to obtain a more accurate estimation of the amount of data recorded per speaker .
Subsequent recognition experiments will look at large vocabulary speech from a far-field microphone ( as performed in Switchboard evaluations ) .
Current speech alignment techniques assume that foreground speech must be continuous and , barring some isolated words and backchannels , can not cope with overlapping background speech . Performing adaptations on both the foreground and background speaker produced a new variety of misalignments , a problem resulting , in part , from the fact that background speakers often match better to foreground conditions .
Transcribers occasionally misidentified speakers and omitted backchannels that were more hidden in the mixed signal .
The recognizer performed well on time-aligned segments labelled as 'non-overlap ' ( i.e . one person talking ) , while segments labelled as 'overlap ' ( i.e . multiple speakers talking at the same time ) yielded poor results
Project Manager gave a brief introduction of the new remote control project for television sets . During team building , team members got to know each other by drawing their favorite animals with technical devices . When it came to the financial targets , Project Manager planned that the remote control would be priced at 25 Euros on the premise of the 12.5-Euro production cost , and the profit is targeted at 50 million Euros . The market range would be international . Then , ideas about new technical features of the remote control were proposed , such as radio waves and bluetooth , in order to distinguish the product from current ones . Finally , some general arrangements for the next meeting about user requirements and technical functions were made by Project Manager and each team member was required to think on the most important thing from their own point of view .
The remote control would be priced at 25 Euros , produced at the cost of 12.5 Euros . Since the company has international market range , at least 2 million units would have to be sold to meet the company 's profit goals of 50 million Euros .
User Interface believed the most important function is to switch channels , and so it would be better to keep the remote control as basic as possible . Marketing proposed that the remote control had to be multi-purpose to be competitive among current products . Project Manager agreed to do something special on the product , but PM also pointed out being user-friendly was also of importance .
Marketing put forward innovative ideas including using radio waves and bluetooth . In the proposal , some potential problems about high cost and being limited to marketing aspects had also been mentioned by Marketing . Based on this , PM agreed that those ideas could help the product to be special and competitive , but PM also pinpointed that such a product required strong support of high technology . Besides , being user-friendly should not be ignored .
Marketing recommended developing a multi-purpose remote control because most of the remote controls on the market were made just for one purpose . Besides , Marketing suggested to use some other technology , such as radio waves and bluetooth , than infrared because it could be easily affected by obstacles . Thirdly , a nice added feature was to inform users of the coming programmes . Marketing conceived a high-tech remote control to be competitive among other products .
Project Manager gave each team member different tasks . Project Manager asked Industrial Designer to look at the working design , User Interface to work on the technical functions and Marketing to be responsible for user requirements . User Interface recommended to achieve some agreement on whether to use the new remote control for multiple systems , and User Interface also asked whether to use a text screen or bluetooth . Besides , Project Manager also demanded that everyone in the group should individually ponder the most important thing in this project from their own perspective .
This was a conceptual design meeting , at which some decisions on product components , functional design , and pricing were made . The group spent a lot of time discussing the components of the device , especially the scroll wheel and power source . The main topics in the discussion about functional design were speech recognition and the function of rolling through the user 's favourite channels . The former was abandoned while the latter was adopted by the group for its novelty and feasibility . After discussing the functions , the group thought they were approaching the high-end market , so they could push up the price . In spite of that , the project manager supposed the profit expectation might not be so important as opening up a new market and promoting their brand . In the end , they agreed to price the product at thirty-five to fifty Euros .
The group decided to produce a mid-sized remote control with a printed circuit board , a medium chip , a transistor , a scroll wheel , a power cradle , a locator , a radio transmitter , an antenna , a speaker , double curves , some LEDs and some buttons . The casing material would be a combination of rubber and plastic .
The user interface designer pointed out that if they were to go with titanium , there would be limitations in the amount of shapes because it was tough to shape the titanium . Also , wood was not suitable as it seemed anti-technology . Thus , the user interface designer recommended making a thick plastic inner shell and a rubber outer shell which was more durable and felt better .
When everybody was using buttons , a scroll wheel would be new and different , which might push somebody over the edge when they were looking at the new controller versus something else . Plus , many people today were television surfers , and the scroll was a great mechanism for surfing . But there were two problems with the scroll wheel . On one hand , it broke down easily and would bring down the robustness of the whole product . On the other hand , users had to scroll really slowly to keep in pace with the TV 's ability to change channels , which would be frustrating .
The main topics in the discussion about functional design were the functions of speech recognition and rolling through the user 's favourite channels . The former was abandoned because it would be disturbed by other sounds , while the latter was adopted by the group for its novelty and feasibility .
The industrial designer and the user interface designer did n't think speech recognition was practical because it would surely be affected by other sounds if the TV was on or people spoke up in the middle of a TV show . Then the project manager proposed to design a button to activate the recognition , but there would be no difference with controlling the TV by just pressing buttons .
According to the user interface designer , to implement this function , the users should press a button to start the program and type in their favourite channels . The project manager liked this idea and the marketing thought it would be another great market tool . In terms of the cost , the project manager believed it would n't be too expensive because they could come up with a partnership to produce that quite cheaply , but the marketing held that the technology was available through their own service . Furthermore , this function must be accompanied by a mode switch and an indicator .
After discussing the functions , the group thought they were approaching the high-end market , so they could push up the price . In spite of that , the project manager supposed the profit expectation might not be so important as opening up a new market and promoting their brand . In the end , they agreed to price the product at thirty-five to fifty Euros .
A new remote control project was introduced by Project Manager . Members made self-introductions and began to know each other by guessing animals others drew . Project manager said that the remote control would be sold at 25 Euros and a production cost of 12.5 Euros . Project Manager also hoped to achieve fifty million Euros and international market by new remote control . Then the team discussed the disadvantages of the remote control and designed a new remote control style . Industrial Designer made a desire to design a remote control that can be used in different devices with most used buttons . Project Manager agreed that rather than complicated buttons , friendly to users and minimalist design with necessary buttons would be better .
User Interface thought that remote control was easy to lose and complex to use and then suggested new remote control can be integrated . Industrial Designer thought the remote control had too many buttons and a bad signal . Marketing thought different devices had different remote controls . Project Manager thought remote control was all black and boring , then he suggested making remote control fun .
Industrial Designer expressed a desire to make the remote friendly to users . He hoped that new remote control should work on different devices . User Interface suggested taking different kinds of Tv like teletext into consideration . Project Manager agreed and supposed remote control with the least amount of buttons .
Industrial Designer desired to make the remote with most used buttons so that the remote was friendly to users . Unnecessary buttons should be behind some kind of protection so that they only can be seen when needed . Instead of a big size , the remote control should be the normal size with the least amount of buttons .
Marketing thought the market included all kinds of people no matter if they were old and young . So it would be better if their aim was the whole world and Britain . Users Interface suggested that market aim should take the remote control style into consideration about . For instance in Britain , people had many things to do with TV . But normal TVs were not like this .
Industrial Designer thought it was impossible to accommodate different TVs on one remote control . Because you ca n't use a Panasonic remote control on a Philips television . However , Marketing believed that this problem could be solved by a universal remote with code .
Industrial Designer thought customers would buy a new remote control when they lost or broke the first one . They also bought a new one if they got an older TV . On the other hand , User Interface thought in the future , customers would need remote control with buttons .
This meeting was primarily concerned with the design process and specific designing requirements of the remote control . Project Manager first introduced the goal of the new remote control project as to be original , trendy and user-friendly so as to bear an advantage over competitive products . Then three steps of the design process were respectively introduced and explained by Project Manager , and drawings of favourite animals then followed as an imagination-inspiring activity . According to Project Manager , the fifty-million-Euro financial objective of the project would be achieved at a production cost lower than 12.5 Euros and a twofold selling price . Competitiveness-endowing requirements for remote control design were then proposed and carefully discussed .
Mutual greeting heralded the beginning of the meeting and the goal of the new remote control project was introduced by Project Manager to the conferees as to win over competitive products by being original , trendy and user-friendly . Then Project Manager continued with the introduction of the design process , which was divided into three main parts—functional design , conceptual design and desired design that respectively focused on the user-related technical functions , desirable user interface and different trends involved , and specific implementation and choice-detailing process of conceptual design .
Project Manager recommended a drawing activity of conferees ’ favourite animals with the aim of inspiring and contributing to the design process of the remote control .
Given the customer demand and conferees personal experiences , several designing requirements were proposed during the discussion . The remote control was decided to be adaptable to multiple devices with few buttons , be able to be lighted in the dark and held in hand , and be both water-proof and shock-proof along with a whistle tracking system , based on which advantage over competitors might well be gained at the price of a rising production cost .
Considering the product originality , Project Manager believed that a water-proof remote control could be used in the bath conveniently while saving the customer ’ s need to purchase an extra plastic cover . Therefore , originality and competitiveness might be gained over competitive products .
Conferees agreed that the remote control could be sold with optional plastic protection and water-proof box for customers to choose .
Industrial Designer first recommended adding a special beeping button on the TV set to remind users of where the remote controls were , but the plan was deemed impractical concerning TV sets that were not designed by them . Then Project Manager suggested whistle tracking and was approved by all the conferees as an original improvement .
